He developed a flexible method of psychotherapy to assist people to overcome feelings of inferiority, focussing on the relation of an individual to the goals and values determined by their social environment. </p><p>Adler was born into a middle-class Jewish family, attending the same school as Sigmund Freud. He qualified as an eye doctor, but in 1902, joined <a href="../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Freud</a>’s Wednesday Psychological Society and brought the idea of “organ inferiority” from opthamology to psychology. Adler argued that a person’s sensitivity to the weakness of an organ led a person to dwell on it and generate excessive cerebral activity.</p><p>Adler was married to Raissa Epstein, a Russian-born socialist; he was acquainted with Leon Trotsky when he was in exile in Vienna, was therapist to the Bolshevik Adolf Joffe and was a regular contributor to <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>, the Vienna daily socialist newspaper. His first book dealt with the social causes of physical illnesses.</p> <p>After his <span class="book">Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Psychical Compensation</span> was published in 1907, his own views began to take shape independently, down-playing Freud’s insistence on the centrality of sexual conflicts in early childhood as the cause mental illness. For Adler it was a person’s striving for self-esteem and recognition that is central, and sexual problems were seen as expressing difficulties arising in this area.</p><p>In 1909, Adler was the first to argue that psychoanalysis supplied a complement to Marxism, and that sensitivity to slights provided a psychological basis for the development of class consciousness. Adler also tied the psychology of inferiority to the struggle for wmen’s rights. Influenced by his wife, the women’s movement and Social-Democracy, he reformulated his idea of organ-inferiority in terms of bisexuality. By “femininity,” he wrote, the neurotic “understands almost everything that is bad, certainly anything inferior.” Attempting to avoid what is pathological, that is, passive or “feminine,” the neurotic engaged in compensatory forms of self-assertion that Adler called “the masculine protest.” All neuroses “are derived and obtain their power from the battle between the feminine foundation and the masculine protest. ... one must assume the presence of the masculine protest in all women without exception ... since the devaluation of woman is the driving force in our civilisation. ... There is no principle more generally valid for all human relatiionships than ‘on top of’ and ‘underneath’.” </p><p>From 1911, Adler broke from Freud and became publicly critical of him and in 1912, coined the term <em>individual psychology</em> to characterise his own views, as set out in <span class="book">The Neurotic Constitution</span>. </p><p>Adler held that difficulties people encounter in gaining self-esteem and recognition, if not overcome by the normal means lead to compensatory behaviour and resultant personality disorders which are now widely referred to as an <em>inferiority complex</em>. </p><p>The other important elements of Adler’s psychology are <em>lifestyle</em> – the particular system of values and activities which a person acquires in their upbringing, and the <em>social interest drive</em> – an urge to cooperate with other people for the common good, which Adler took to be inherent in human beings. The method of therapy he used is simply to direct the patient’s attention to the unsuccessful, neurotic character of the way the patient is dealing with their feeling of inferiority, and assist the patient in restoring a feeling of self-esteem and in working out a realistic set of goals. </p><p>In 1934 the fascist government in Austria closed his 30 child guidance clinics.

After May 1947, when the PCF was dismissed from the Cabinet as the “Cold War” got under way, the PCF did not participate in any administration, though it won up to one-third and on average a quarter of the vote till 1968.</p><p>The dark post-war mood that lent existentialism its appeal faded when economic recovery set in, and in the boom-period of the 1960s it was replaced by a new vogue called structuralism, whose scientific pretensions better suited a technological age. Structuralism became an intellectual fashion in the 1960s in France, <a href="../j/a.htm#jakobson-roman">Roman Jakobson</a>’s linguistic structuralism, <a href="../b/a.htm#barthes-roland">Roland Barthes</a>’ structuralist literary criticism and <a href="../l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude">Lévi-Strauss</a>’s anthropological structuralism enjoyed widespread interest. Louis Althusser and his student <a href="../f/o.htm#foucault-michel">Michel Foucault</a> were also regarded as representatives of this current. The structuralists stressed the persistence of “deep structures” that underlie all human cultures, leaving little room for either historical change or human initiative.</p><p>Starting from Marx’s criticism of empiricism, Althusser rejected the positive content of empirical knowledge entirely. Althusser asserts that Essence is not to be found in Appearance, but must be discovered through ’theoretical practice’ - “history features in [Marx’s] <span class="book">Capital</span> as an object of theory, not as a real object, as an ’abstract’ (conceptual) object and not as a real-concrete object". Thus, as in Kant, the ’real’ history lies in a ’beyond’, behind the ’theory of history’, which is the only true object of knowledge. Althusser further rejects the concept of contradiction in Marx and Hegel, which he sees in structuralist terms as “over-determination". Althusser saw the early chapters of Marx’s <span class="book">Capital</span> not as a key, but a barrier to understanding Marx’s view of capitalist society, advising readers to begin <span class="book">Capital</span> with Part II. Althusser thus arrives not at a revision, but at a complete negation of Marx. <a href="../../../reference/archive/althusser/works/formarx/althuss1.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">On Marx</span></a> is the earliest work in which his criticism of Marx is put forward.

This tendency was encouraged by the decline in support Stalinist Parties commanded from the 1950s, the continued failure of Stalin’s regime to resolve the problems of the USSR, the repression of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 alienated many communists in the Western countries and was encouraged by the example of Tito’s Yugoslavia from 1948 on.</p><p>The term Eurocommunism was coined in the mid-1970s and received wide publicity after the publication of <span class="book">Eurocommunism and the State</span> (1977) by the Spanish Stalinist leader Santiago Carrillo.</p><p>By the 1970s structuralism began to give way to a cluster of doctrines loosely labelled “post-structuralist,” each variety identified with its own master-thinker: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan.</p><h5>Althusser’s Theory:<br />Relations of production → Apparatus → Ideology → Subject </h5><p>Althusser’s concept of <em>subject</em> flows from his concept of <em>ideology</em>:</p><p class="indentb">“ideology has the function (which defines it) of ‘constituting’ concrete individuals as subjects, ideology being nothing but its functioning in the material forms of existence of that functioning.” <br />[Althusser 1971]</p><p class="fst">And ideology and subjectivity are in turn inseparable from <em>practice</em>:</p><p class="indentb">“1. there is no practice except by and in an ideology; <br />2. there is no ideology except by the subject and for subjects.” <br />[Althusser 1971]</p><p>And practice and ideology are to be understood in turn via his conception of the institutions in which practice takes place, the “Ideological State Apparatuses” (ISAs), institutions constituted by ideology, in which people’s activity is constituted as social practice. </p><p>The state, in the orthodox, Marxist sense of the term, he calls the “Repressive State Apparatus” (RSA), the organisation of violence used by a (capitalist) ruling class in order to maintain conditions for the production and reproduction of the (capitalist) relations of production. The RSA and the ISAs are both <em>instruments</em> wielded by the state power, i.e., the dominant social class (the bourgeoisie); both function by means of both ideology and violence, violence acting as a last resort, but the Repressive SA is predominantly violent, while the Ideological SAs are predominantly ideological in their functioning. </p><p>What are the ISAs? The Church, the Family, the Law, the political system including the various political parties, the Trade Unions, the Media, the “Cultural ISA” (including the artists and the various institutions which publish, teach, fund, display literature and art, etc.), and, according to Althusser, the dominant ISA –  the Education system. </p><h5>Subjects</h5><p>As an aside, note that in this conception, it is <em>classes</em> whose interest, consciousness and power is at work in society and history, so it would appear that Althusser sees classes as “subjects” in history. But at the same time he asserts that there are <em>no</em> subjects acting in history at all, that history is a process without a subject. In “Marxism and Humanism” he claims that in “the Marxist theory of history. The ‘subjects’ of history are <em>given human societies</em>,” (recall that Marx himself rejected the idea of ‘society’ as a coherent entity of any kind, let alone a subject). But Althusser signals that he does not share this conception by the placing of quotation marks around the word ‘subject’. Althusser also refutes, without very much difficulty, the idea that History is the work of an Hegelian Spirit or of a Subject (capital-S), Man, an idea which he ascribes to the ‘Young Marx’. If History is not to be the work of a (singular) <em>Subject</em>, then<em> ipso facto</em>, we are led to presume, there can be no subjects (plural) acting in history at all. </p><p>Institutions, such as the state apparatus, are instruments which are <em>used</em> by the class which is the state power; classes wield power, struggle against one another and make alliances. Class struggle is a central concept for Althusser: “Ideologies always express <em>class</em> positions.” But Althusser does not hold that a class acting as “a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions” (to use Althusser’s own definition) warrants it being called a subject. He talks of classes <em>as if</em> they were subjects (they have interests, they struggle, they have consciousness), but for Descartes, limits the notion of subject to <em>concrete individuals</em>. But in the case of the individual subject, as we shall see, being a subject does not mean what it might be supposed to mean.</p><p>By his rejection of the concept of a <em>singular</em> Subject at work in history (God, for all intents and purposes), Althusser sees himself as having done with all notions of a <em>collective</em> subject, whether it be a ‘scientific’ conception of <em>collective</em> subjects (such as nations, social movements, institutions or social classes) or ‘spiritual’ conceptions such as that of Hegel. Just as for Kant and Descartes, for Althusser, subjects are individuals; the question is only what being such a subject can amount to. </p><p>What Althusser has left out is any consideration of whether, by combining together in some rational form of voluntary collectivity, some self-conscious system of activity or social movement, people can rise to a level where they are capable of becoming collectively, “a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions” and become to some extent subjects in their own lives, collectively. Grand ensembles, like ‘Man’ or ‘Society’, can only be understood as subjects if one adopts a spiritualistic conception. Lukacs’ conception of the working class as a subject in history depended on the reality of the Communist International being the actual leadership of an international workers’ movement, a movement in which millions of individuals saw themselves as communists, actively looked to the Comintern for leadership and transmitted that commitment to those around them. That reality proved to be transitory if not entirely illusory.</p><p>But all sorts of corporate entities, from nations to companies, <em>do</em> act as subjects, as well as more diffuse social movements. But isn’t there room for a concept of subjects which lies <em>between</em> the mysticism of “Geist” and idealism of the Kantian transcendental subject, <em>between</em> the romanticism of “Man” and the positivism of the Individual? This is territory into which Althusser does not venture.</p><h5>Apparatuses</h5><p>Although all the social institutions are called Ideological <em>State</em> Apparatuses, they may be public or private, formal or informal, because they function to reproduce the capitalist relations of production, and therefore serve the interests of the capitalist class; so they are deemed <em>state</em> apparatuses. Althusser was writing in the 1960s and 1970s, a time when the (Keynesian Welfare) capitalist state rested to a large degree on the trade unions, and when there was a high degree of social integration. The intense class conflict following the end of World War II had ended, as the Marshall Plan was used to suppress popular discontent in Europe. This brought a kind of peace and prosperity to the masses which made capitalism look homogeneous, the same situation which had prompted Herbert Marcuse to write “One Dimensional Man.” In this conjuncture, it was probably not controversial on the Left for Althusser to include the Trade Unions as an Ideological State Apparatus, as part of the system of ideological domination by the bourgeoisie. Under Khrushchev’s policy of ‘peaceful co-existence’, the French Communist Party and the PCF-controlled CGT could be included in that characterisation. The idea that the Family is the bedrock of capitalist society is still widespread; but the inclusion of the arts as a “cultural ideological state apparatus” makes it clear enough that <em>any</em> institution to be found in capitalist society is <em>ipso facto</em> an apparatus by means of which the bourgeoisie maintain bourgeois relations of production. ‘The system’ is all-pervasive.</p><p>And this is the point really. Is it reasonable to paint a picture of modern society which is so utterly closed to criticism, so homogeneous, so impenetrable? Is absolutely every route to change closed in advance?</p><h5>Ideology</h5><p>In a way somewhat similar to how a ‘discourse’ constitutes an institution, for Althusser, each of the institutions he refers to as ISAs correspond to an <em>ideology</em>, a religious, ethical, legal, political or whatever ideology, whose material existence is the rituals and practices of the corresponding ISA, organised around a concept of God, Law, Art or whatever. An ideology expresses a class position through a specific regular form of material practice (ISA), which functions ideologically to ensure the reproduction of capitalism, and is backed up by violence, either internally, or through the RSA. </p><p>But (and this is a virtue of Althusser’s approach) all the ISAs are <em>relatively autonomous</em> with respect to one another. Although each serves to facilitate the reproduction of elements of the capitalist relations of production, they are not purely and simply generated by the capitalist mode of production, understood as an ‘expressive totality’. Each apparatus has its own logic and operates to some degree independently of the others.</p><p>Each ISA, with its various ‘rituals’ and characteristic forms of practice, constitutes the material existence of the relevant ideology: Art (the ideology of art) is materially constituted by the practices of the art world – its methods of evaluation, control, distribution and production, and so forth. The objective material actions of individuals performing these (or other) practises constitute what could be called the ideas which make up this ideology. </p><p class="indentb"> “[An individual’s] ideas are his material actions 
INSERTed into material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which derive the ideas of that subject.” </p><p>Discourse is the medium of ideology, and consciousness is internal verbal discourse. Thus consciousness is an internalisation of the material practices of the ISAs in which a person participates, language being the principal transmission mechanism for this process of internalisation. </p><h5>Science</h5><p>But this leads to a difficulty surely? How is it possible to distinguish Science from Ideology? By definition:</p><p class="indentb"> “Ideology represents the imaginary <b>relationship</b> of individuals to their real conditions of existence.” </p><p>All ideologies are “myths” which “do not correspond to reality” and are “illusions.” But Althusser <em>counterposes</em> Ideology to <em>Science</em>, which, he says, is <em>not</em> ideology. “Religious ideology, ethical ideology, legal ideology, political ideology” are “timeless” “world outlooks,” and:</p><p class="indentb"> “assuming that we do not live one of these ideologies as the truth (e.g. ‘believe’ in God, Duty, Justice, etc....), we admit that the ideology we are discussing from a critical point of view, examining it as the ethnologist examines the myths of a ‘primitive society’, that these ‘world outlooks’ are largely imaginary, i.e. do not ‘correspond to reality’.”</p><p>Science provides us with a means of knowing things because it presents a true representation of our relationship to our conditions of existence, whereas ideology can describe things, but only by means of a false relationship to our conditions:</p><p class="indentb">“an ideology is a system (with its own logic and rigour) of representations (images, myths, ideas or concepts, depending on the case) endowed with a historical existence and role within a given society. ... ideology, as a system of representations, is distinguished from science in that in it the practico-social function is more important than the theoretical function (function as knowledge).”</p><p>Surely the only possible way of making sense of this is to allow that with science, just as with education, politics, literature, and so on, there are forms of practice, constituted in some kind of apparatus, acts within which constitute the ideas of <em>science</em>? How can science be any different in this respect? How can science not be constituted in regular, institutionalised forms of practice with its own scientific discourse? But this is not how Althusser sees it.</p><p>According to Althusser, Ideology is the ‘lived’ relation between men and their world, an unconscious relation which may or may not be reflected in the form of a systematic ‘philosophy’. Ideology is distinguished from a science not by its falsity or incoherence, but by the fact that the work of <em>reproduction of the relations of production</em>, predominates in it over <em>theoretical practice</em>, over knowledge production. Each science arises out of the pre-scientific world of ideas, out of ideology, by means of what Althusser calls the <em>epistemological break</em>, a ‘leap’ which entails a radical break from the whole previous frame of reference, and the construction of a new problematic. Ideology survives alongside science as an element of the social formation.</p><p>Althusser sees (scientific) theoretical practice as a fourth practice, over and above the economic, political and ideological practices which together constitute a social formation. The work of theoretical practice is to transform ideology into knowledge, criticising the timeless conceptions of ideology which indicate objects but fail to open them to understanding. </p><p>However, just as wage workers are not ‘subjects’ of their own labor, being nothing more than factors of production organised by capital, which is responsible for the process of production, science is a <em>subjectless</em> process which brings together and activates all the components and conditions of scientific practice. The individuals who actually perform the work cannot claim to be ‘subjects’ of their scientific production, any more than wage workers are subjects of economic production. In both cases the individuals are mere bearers of a practico-social process.</p><p>But surely this only makes sense if we consider that systematic thought <em>in general</em> (and not just myths), thought which brings to light the <em>real </em>relationship of individuals to their conditions of existence (as opposed to imaginary relationships), thought which is not timeless and impervious to history, but on the contrary is <em>historical</em>, <em>scientific</em> thought, is <em>also</em> to be understood as constituted in certain, relatively autonomous, regular forms of practice, with its own ‘scientific world outlook’?</p><p>Althusser designates science as a practice (like economics, politics and ideology) but it is entirely unclear how scientific discourse and scientific practice, carried out by individuals who are <em>not subjects</em>, authors of or responsible for their actions, constitutes the ideas of science, but can be in some way qualitatively different from ideology. It seems that science, which discloses the real relation of people to their conditions of existence, is just as much tied up with class relations as ideology which “always expresses <em>class</em> positions.” But Althusser makes no suggestion that a proletarian class interest detracts from the scientific character of a theoretical work. In order to be <em>objective</em>, science must be beliefs and actions <em>without subjects</em>, a subject-less discourse and a subjectless practice. So the author of scientific work, who is an individual person, and therefore a “subject,” and therefore ideological, “is completely absent as a ‘subject’ from ‘his’ scientific discourse.” The individual scientist is just a cog in the machinery of science. A lot of scientific work nowadays, of course, looks just like a manufacturing industry production line, with PhDs handed out much like trades apprenticeships, but can the entire process be represented in that way, at every level? </p><p>In the Preface to <em>Capital</em> Volume One, Althusser goes on to claim that “The struggle for Marxist science and Marxist philosophy is today, as it was yesterday, a form of political and ideological class struggle.” But Science remains subjectless even while it serves the class struggle, and is permeated with a class position, that of the proletariat. The identification of science with socialism was still uncontroversial in Althusser’s day, but that has long since ceased to be the case, thanks in some measure to the ‘socialist humanists’ who Althusser was opposing. </p><p>Althusser sees <em>Capital</em> as a work of science (as did Marx), and in his terms, to describe <em>Capital</em> as a work of ethics, would be tantamount to condemning it as ideological; <em>all</em> ethics is ideological for Althusser. But by making an absolute out of science, Althusser himself has fallen prey to Ideology. All knowledge is <em>for something</em>; knowledge arises only in connection with certain forms of activity and not others. So a conception of science which isolates science from ethics is abstract and self-delusion.</p><h5>Ideology</h5><p>For Althusser, being a subject, ‘believing in’ an ideology, and participating in the ritual and practices of an Ideological Apparatus are all one and the same:</p><p class="indentb">“the decisive central term on which everything else depends is the notion of the <em>subject</em>.  ... the category of subject ... is the constitutive category of all ideology, ... only ... insofar as all ideology has the function (which defines it) of ‘constituting’ concrete individuals as subjects, ideology being nothing but its functioning in the material forms of existence of that functioning.”</p><p>Already in this formulation, we can see how ‘subjects’ in Althusser’s understanding, far from really being free, responsible agents, are <em>subjected</em> beings. And subjects are individual human beings, not classes or nations:</p><p class="indentb">“The individual ... behaves in such and such a way, adopts such and such a practical attitude, and, what is more, participates in certain regular practices which are those of the ideological apparatus on which ‘depend’ the ideas which he has in all consciousness freely chosen as a subject. ... and freely accepts, must ‘<em>act</em> according to his ideas’, must therefore inscribe his own ideas as a free subject in the actions of his material practice. ... these practices are governed by the <em>rituals</em> in which these practices are inscribed, within the <em>material existence of an ideological apparatus</em>.”</p><p>Only a concrete individual person can be a subject, but to be a subject the individual must be taken up by forms of practice constituted by <em>timeless</em> ideologies, ideologies for which there is ‘no outside’, constituting an imaginary relationship of the individual to their real conditions of existence and functionally determined as ideological apparatuses for the maintenance of the dominant, capitalist mode of production. </p><p>Despite the relative independence of the various ideological and repressive apparatuses, they form a closed universe in which no consciousness is possible other than an illusory, functionally prescribed, bourgeois consciousness. The individual subject’s belief that they act of their own free will is an illusion. Even before they are born, they are destined to bear their father’s name, their role is determined before they know it themselves – their gender, their abilities, their family, etc. – the subject is always-already the subject they come to know themselves as, when they are called, and ‘find their place’ in society by being 
INSERTed into a position an Ideological State Apparatus. This is the process which Althusser calls ‘interpellation’ – the individual’s recognition of themselves as answering to an identity ascribed to them by the Ideological State Apparatus, materially, the 
INSERTion or subsumption of their activity into practices constituting the ISA. </p><p>Althusser takes Christianity an as an “example” of an ideology, claiming that “the same demonstration can be produced for ethical, political, aesthetic ideology, etc.,” and then goes on to make points about religion which are claimed without demonstration to be also applicable to (EG) ethics. So “there can only be such a multitude of possible religious subjects on the absolute condition that there is a Unique, Absolute, <em>Other Subject</em>, i.e. God.”  So we have each ISA as constituted by a Principle – God in the Christian Church – to which subjects are subjected when they are socialised into practice and rituals within the given ISA. Through the subjects’ recognition of the “Subject” (capital-S, i.e., God or Law or Art, etc.) and each other, individuals come to recognise themselves as subjects. On this basis, with the absolute certainty of a closed world, the subjects are free to “work by themselves.” </p><p>The question has to asked though, is the fact (if we take it to be a fact) that a person operates within what could be called a shared system of illusions, they are ipso facto incapable of being genuinely the morally responsible initiator of their actions, and that they are completely incapable in exercising rational control over their destiny? </p><h5>The Subjected Subject </h5><p>As a good structuralist, Althusser can cap off his “proof” of the subjected character of the self-deluded subject with an archetypical sleight of hand of the kind so popular among French structuralists:</p><p class="indentb"> “... The whole mystery of this effect lies ... in the ambiguity of the term <em>subject.</em> In the ordinary use of the term, subject in fact means: (1) <b>a free subjectivity, a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions</b>; (2) <b>a subjected being, who submits to a higher authority</b>, and is therefore stripped of all freedom except that of freely accepting his submission. ... the individual <em>is interpellated as a</em> (<em>free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject</em>, <em>i.e. in order that he shall (freely)</em> <em>accept his subjection</em>, ...</p><p>But of course the two opposite meanings of the word “subject” have quite different genealogies. Descartes, criticising Aristotle, used the Latin translation of Aristotle’s <span class="greek">upokeimenon</span> (<em>hypokeimenon</em>), <em>subjectum</em>, to mean the substance (<em>substantia</em>) to which all attributes adhered, i.e., (for Descartes) the individual self-consciousness and cogito; Kant went on to define this subject as the sovereign individual, the “free subjectivity, a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions.” This meaning of the word “subject” has continued in use, but exclusively within philosophical discourse and only in fairly recent times has it penetrated a broader audience.</p><p>On the other hand, “subject” entered the English language in the 14th century in the sense of someone under the dominion of or owing allegiance to a sovereign power, being <em>subject</em> to its laws, enjoying its protection. At this time, “subjectum” was understood in the Aristotlean sense, prior to Descartes transformation of the subject into an active agent within a philosophical discourse. In ordinary usage, “subject” retained this passive meaning, and took on further usages, such as being the subject of a poem or an accusation or being subjected to taxes, and so on. </p><p>Rather than an ambiguity, what we have is effectively two different words, two different concepts. The connection between the two meanings of “subject” is <em>historical</em>, not logical. It is nothing more than a structuralist trick to suggest a necessary connection to <em>being a subject</em> (i.e., a self-conscious, knowing author of one’s own actions) and <em>being subjected</em> to a higher authority. The two meaning, while not absolutely incompatible, are opposite in their meaning and have different contexts.</p><h5>Agency</h5><p>Althusser’s solution to this riddle entails the conception that while he, Althusser, is but a humble subject, nevertheless, as a scientist, he is able to participate in and be mouthpiece or vehicle for science. Science in his conception is not an Ideology, but truth, and as such is a process without a subject; it is subjectless, an objective process. But its truths find their way into print via the pens of humble subjects who should not delude themselves about having made a discovery or having been responsible for creating anything. This despite the claim that science is only possible “from a proletarian class viewpoint, and with the new practice of philosophy that follows from it.” [Althusser 1971]</p><p>This leads to the absurd and reactionary position that Althusser must teach his students a scientific point of view, namely that history is a process without a subject, but at the same tell them that the working class can rise only to the level of socialist humanism, an <em>ideology</em>, and encourage his readers to keep science to themselves, and propagate ideology to the workers instead. </p><p>In <em>Marxism and Humanism</em>, Althusser explains that “even a communist society could ever do without ideology, be it ethics, art or ‘world outlook’”:</p><p class="indentb">“... it is not conceivable that communism, a new mode of production implying determinate forces of production and relations of production, could do without a social organization of production, and corresponding ideological forms. / So ideology is ... a structure essential to the historical life of societies.” </p><p>So for Althusser, ideology is somewhat like Plato’s ‘beautiful lies’, the Christianity of Hobbes and Kant, Robespierre’s ‘Festival of the Supreme Being’ or August Comte’s ‘Religion of Humanity’ – popular illusions necessary to maintain the institutions of society; the philosopher doesn’t believe in it, but for practical purposes people have to be persuaded to believe in it, just like people have to believe in the necessity of driving on the left hand side of the road, even though science tells us that the right hand side would be just as good. This overstates the case a little, because Althusser accepts that not only is socialist humanism necessary for the proper functioning of the institutions of socialist society, but:</p><p class="indentb">“When I say that the concept of humanism is an ideological concept (not a scientific one), I mean that while it really does<em> designate a set of existing relations</em>, unlike a scientific concept, it does not <em>provide us with a means of knowing them</em>.” </p><p>Nevertheless, it would seem hard to see why a ‘scientific concept’ which does ‘provide us with a means of knowing’ existing relations, cannot also function as the ‘relay whereby ... the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the profit of all’. Are we really “bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society” (to quote Marx’s description of materialism in “Theses on Feuerbach” No. 3)?</p><p>The problem here is that communism is not for Althusser a struggle for self-emancipation, but rather just a process without a subject, a process leading from one set of institutions to another, and under such conditions, the very notion of ‘emancipation’ is meaningless.</p><p>Althusser was writing not long after Jean-Paul Sartre published his <em>Critique of Dialectical Reason</em>, and it can be seen how Althusser and Sartre confront similar problems and share many of the same assumptions, but they come to different conclusions. Sartre is trying to grapple with how mass social movements – ‘fused groups’ – which are real, living expressions of subjectivity, become eventually transformed into a reactionary and ossified bureaucracy like the USSR. Althusser sees the USSR as en route to socialist society via the withering away of the state, and characterises opponents of the bureaucracy as unscientific ideologues. One gets a real feeling of discomfort as Sartre wrestles with these problems. Not so Louis Althusser, who even puts the word ‘abuses’ in inverted commas in referring to the crimes of the Stalin period – after all, these were just problems in the superstructure, not the real foundations of socialism. Ha! Althusser greeted the student uprisings of May/June 1968 firstly with silence, later describing them as infantile Leftism. Sartre perhaps just went a little overboard in his enthusiastic support of the students.</p><p>The idea that every aspect culture in capitalist societies is completely determined by bourgeois ideology, leaving no room at all for social movements which genuinely challenge capitalism, was a powerful idea in its day; an idea which both <em>expressed</em> and <em>supported</em> the strength of bourgeois society. The idea that the only threat to capitalism came from an entrenched bureaucracy in the USSR and China, was also plausible in its day, being expressive of mainstream bourgeois ideology and an important prop for capitalism. The idea that humanist criticisms of Stalinism and capitalism were just unscientific delusions, whilst truth was available only thanks to the work of a privileged stratum of ‘scientists’ expressed the spirit of certain social layers for a time. Nothing could better express the ethos of contemporary capitalism (from the point of view of those suffering its injustices) than a theory that explains that individuals are nothing but deluded pawns of the system and that if there is anything to be done about the situation at all, then it has to be left to the experts. </p><p>The question has to be asked though, at <em>what point</em>, coming down from epochal shifts in history, to changes in government, to events in union branches or workplaces to deciding when to have lunch, is there room for free will? Self-evidently, there is some dividing line, but nothing in Althusser makes it possible to work out where such a dividing line could lie. Equally, given their social position, at what point is an agent simply choosing to do what, in any case, they <em>had to do</em>, or what their previous actions had inevitably led them to do, and at what point is the agent’s well-chosen or mistaken action an original factor in the situation not to be understood in any other way than as the result of their intervention? </p><p>There may be only one road across the Alps but Hannibal still had to find it.</p><h5>Real Issues</h5><p>Nevertheless, Althusser raises some real problems. Looked at from a distance, from outside, the impact of individuals on the course of history does appear as nothing more than a bit of a wiggle on the historical trajectory, so to speak. History does appear to unfold according to laws which can be the object if science, law which cannot be altered by the intervention of individual subjects.</p><p>Consequently, the only sense in which consciousness determines the course of history seems to be as ideology, as the ‘lived’ relation of people to their world, which functions to coordinate practice within the various social formations, whether “Ideological State Apparatuses” or revolutionary social movements. “Theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses,” (Marx) but not when necessarily only it is true. History is made by the movement of masses of people, and such movements are constituted by shared systems of belief which can rightly be called ‘ideology’ in as much as their principal function is not theoretical but ‘practico-social’. Masses of people, moved by ideology which from an outsider’s point of view represents only an imaginary relation of people to their conditions of existence, can indeed make history, and in doing so such movements more closely resemble tidal movements than they resemble self-conscious, knowing, sovereign actors. But isn’t science also capable of moving masses? And doesn’t the project of emancipation require that science and not self-deception be the weapon of choice?</p><p>Althusser’s theory leads to some horrific and counter-intuitive conclusions: that scientific ideas are not suitable for general distribution, that <em>ideology</em> should instead be promoted for general distribution, that the scientist is as much a creature of ideology as anyone else and that he or she is not the creator, but mere bearer of the science she or he produces, that history unfolds as an entirely objective process, with no subjective component at all, or even openings for subjective intervention. That is, history and society is a natural process which science can understand and control, but even science itself develops as a natural process just like its objects.</p><p>But it is not sufficient to respond to Althusser with a conception of individuals as sovereign subjects, answerable only to laws of their own making (Kant). And nor can we rely on a conception of a collective subject, such as a Communist Party, which is not subject internally to social processes and is able to stand outside and above society. Nevertheless, it is in this ‘third position’, between the World Spirit or Man – mystical extramundane forces working behind the backs of human actors – and the Individual Subject known to common sense, that we must find a way out. Collective subjects do not stand outside society but rather their very substance is practical human life; all social life is, on the other hand, animated by the interpenetration and mutual transformation of a multiplicity of social subjects. Collective subjects have no consciousness, no feeling, no will or intentions, other than those of the individual participants who are instances of them as social subjects. Collective subjects have no ideas or culture, no means other than what is objectified in the mass of cultural objects created and used in the course of social practice.</p><p>See <a href="../../../reference/archive/althusser/index.htm" target="_top">Louis Althusser Archive</a> and <a href="../../../reference/archive/althusser/glossary.htm" target="_top">Louis Althusser Glossary of Terms</a>.</p>')

Ruthenberg grew steadily, while the underground organization atrophied, to be terminated in 1923.

The circle around his bookshop were among those who founded the Communist Party of Australia in 1920.</p><p>In May 1886 David Andrade, his brother Will and half a dozen others formed the Melbourne Anarchist Club, the first anarchist organisation in Australia. Andrade became the MAC secretary and one of its main propagandists. The club produced the journal <em>Honesty</em> which gave club news as well as publishing theoretical articles and Andrade was a regular contributor. Along with his brother, David Andrade followed the booksellers trade. In a news agency at Brunswick and later in Liberty Hall, Russell St. Melbourne the brothers operated the first anarchist book shops in Australia. Here they loaned and sold anarchist publications with their publicity noting that “Socialistic Literature of all kinds (both Communist, Collectivist and Anarchist) are well represented, both in books and pamphlets, and newspapers supplied from all parts of the world.”</p><p>Andrade was an energetic and flamboyant personality who deeply immersed himself in the anarchist activities of the day and was a writer, publisher, printer, distributor, organiser, general propagandist and activist for the anarchist cause. Aside from his contributions to Honesty Andrade’s writings were published in a “wide variety of local and overseas journals.” His main works include “Money: a study of the currency question” (1887), “Our Social System” which was an attack on monopoly in both land ownership and usury, and “An Anarchist Plan of Campaign” (1888). In 1892 he published the “realistic” novel ‘The Melbourne Riots and how Harry Holdfast and his friends emancipated the workers.’ Both The Melbourne Riots and David Andrade have been recently described as “utopian.” </p><p>Andrade was a major participant in the split in MAC in 1888 and was in conflict with J.A. Andrews and other anarcho-communists. The cause of the split in the MAC was over the “forcible reclamation and defence of liberty” – in other words violence. Andrade has been variously described as a “Proudhonist” and a “mutualist” and was at this time and afterwards vehemently opposed to any form of violence. He appears to have been isolated by the split and the publication of Honesty ceased with Andrade taking control of the plant. MAC member and anarcho communist Larry Petrie later described the club as basically “Tolstoyan.” </p><p>After the split Andrade continued his work writing, publishing and bookselling. In the early 1890s he was the secretary of the Unemployed Workers Association in Richmond and in 1893 as an outspoken member of a deputation of the unemployed bitterly attacked the system of representative government “We are ruled by a lot of robbers, and when I see a man go into Parliament I feel sorry for him, for he only makes another of the nest of vermin... Our legislators are more degraded than a person who abuses a woman or a child and I have no confidence in them.” </p><p>Later that year he had taken up a small selection of 10 acres in the Dandenong Ranges where he began clearing the land, building a house and working as a storekeeper and a mailman. His second son Proudhon Andrade was born here in a rough shelter the same year. Andrade persisted in this lifestyle for five years but was burnt out in the disastrous 1898 fires. He appears to have been financially ruined and mentally broken by this event. In 1903 he was admitted to the Yarra Bend Asylum and he lived for the rest of his life in asylums. He died in 1928 and in later years was described as a kind man with a smile on his face. </p><p class="quote">Source: <a href="http://www.takver.com/history/" target="_top">Radical Tradition</a>.</p>')

Under Andropov the KGB became much more effective in suppression of dissents through the use of more subtle means of pressure and intelligence, but allowed large numbers of dissidents to leave the USSR and work from abroad. Under Andropov, the KGB also worked to restrain the ‘Brezhnev mafia’, including the arrest of Brezhnev’s daughter for corruption. Information collected during his KGB days he used to eliminate opposition from the ‘Brezhnev-mafia’ and secure election to the leadership. According to Zhores Medvedev, after the death of Brezhnev, Andropov was the favourite candidate among the dissidents and intelligentsia. For the last 16 years of his life, including his period as head-of-state, Andropov lived in a single-bedroom flat. As head of state, Andropov initiated a campaign against “absenteeism, idleness, drunkenness, etc" and crime but succeeded only in generating opposition and an atmosphere of fear.

Arnot assembled evidence on their behalf and publicised the miners’ cause. Arnot, together with H. H. Slesser, the Federation legal advisor, drafted the Mines Nationalisation Bill which was presented to the Royal Commission set up by the government. During the railway strike later that year, Arnot and the LRD organised publicity for the railwaymen.</p><p>Arnot was one of the founder members of the Communist Party in 1920, as was his second wife, Olive. Robin Page Arnot was also a member of the Party’s Central Committee and as such was arrested under the 1797 Incitement to Mutiny Act in 1925 in the run up to the General Strike and spent six months in jail. He was released on the eve of the strike and helped to form the Northumberland and Durham Joint Strike Committee. He later returned to the LRD as Director of Research and wrote a book on the general strike. </p><p>Arnot was the first Principal of the Marx Memorial Library from 1933 and from 1949-1975 he wrote a famous 6-volume series on the history of the miners. He was also the author of a two-volume <em>Short History of the Russian Revolution</em> (1937). He was elected to the LRD’s Executive in 1938 and was re-elected every year until 1976 when he was made Honorary President. He was also a contributor and working editor for <em>Labour Monthly</em>, the journal founded by R. Palme Dutt, until its last issue in March 1981.

He later met and moved in with Eleanor Marx, the youngest daughter of Karl Marx and became a socialist activist. Aveling was the author of numerous books and pamphlets and was a founding member of the <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-league">Socialist League</a> and the <a href="../../orgs/i/n.htm#ilp">Independent Labour Party</a>.</p><p><strong>Early years</strong></p><p>Edward Aveling was born on 29 November 1849 in Stoke Newington, the fifth of eight children of Rev. Thomas William Baxter Aveling (1815–1884), a Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Mary Ann (d. 1877), daughter of Thomas Goodall, farmer and innkeeper, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.</p><p>Aveling attended Harrow School, and in 1867 began to study medicine at University College London. He graduated with a BSc degree in Zoology in 1870. Aveling began teaching biology and lecturing in science at Kin\' College London but was unable to advance due to his atheism and avowed leftist views. He subsequently on Anatomy and Biology at the London Hospital until 1882.</p><p>Aveling married the heiress Isabel Campbell Frank on 30 July 1872, but the marriage only lasted two years. The pair separated amicably. According to Aveling, the cause of the split was his wif\' inability to abide by his atheist views, although wags whispered that Aveling had married her for her money.</p><p><strong>Political career</strong></p><p>In 1884, Aveling became the partner of Eleanor "Tussy" Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx, despite being the estranged husband of Isabel Frank, a status which remained until her death in 1892. Although his background was in biology rather than political economy, Aveling was thrust into the inner circle of British socialism through his personal relationship with Tussy.</p><p>Later in 1884, Aveling and Marx were both elected to the Executive Council of the Social Democratic Federation. This position proved temporary, because the couple separated from the SDF at the end of the year along with William Morris and Belfort Bax in the acrimonious split which formed the Socialist League.</p><p>In 1884, Frederick Engels enlisted Aveling to help in the translation of first volume of Karl Mar\' Kapital. Aveling also achieved some small success as a playwright under the pen-name Alec Nelson. </p><p>In the autumn of 1886, Aveling and Marx toured and lectured the United States on behalf of the Socialist Labor Party. Upon their return, they wrote a book detailing the situation of the left-wing political movement and trade unions in the US for a British audience. They found the US populated by "unconscious socialists", people who shared socialist values but disclaimed socialist ideas. Aveling and Marx wrote:</p><p class="quote">The mass of American Workers had scarcely any more conception of the meaning of Socialism than had 'their betters.' They also had been grievously misled by capitalist papers and capitalist economists and preachers. Hence it came to pass that after most of our meetings we were met by Knights of Labour, Central Labour Union men, and members of other working-class organisations, who told us that they, entering the place antagonists to Socialism as they fancied, had discovered that for a long time pas they had been holding its ideas.</p><p>During his time in the Socialist League Aveling wrote and translated various socialist texts but nonetheless remained personally unpopular in the movement, the object of a steady steam of gossip and accusations.</p><p>In August 1888, the branch to which Aveling and Marx belonged separated from the anarchist-dominated Socialist League in favor of an independent existence as the Bloomsbury Socialist Society.</p><p>After leaving the Socialist League, Aveling became active in the Gasworker\'Union, for whom he served as an auditor.</p><p>Aveling was a founding member and was elected to the Executive Committee of the Independent Labour Party by the 1893 Conference which established the organisation. He left that group to rejoin the Marxist Social Democratic Federation in 1896, despite his long-standing personal and political quarrel with SDF leader Henry Hyndman.</p><p><strong>Later life, death, and legacy</strong></p><p>In 1897 Aveling left Eleanor and on 8 June that year secretly married an actress, Eva Frye, but returned to Eleanor when he was struck down with kidney disease. After nursing him for some time, Eleanor committed suicide mainly due to his infidelity. Aveling died four months later, on 2 August 1898, in Battersea of kidney disease. His body was cremated in Woking, Surrey, three days later.</p><p>Despite his prominence as a member of the fledgling British Marxist movement, no representatives of the Socialist or Labour movements were present at the funeral due to the widely-held belief that he was responsible for Eleanor Mar\' suicide.</p><p>Aveling was also disliked by many of his contemporaries for his tendency to borrow money from everyone. A biographer of his wife wrote in 1976:</p><p class="quote">The truth is that in moral terms Aveling presented something akin to an optical illusion: looked at in one light, he could be seen as feckless, happy-go-lucky but fundamentally sound; in another, as an unmitigated scoundrel. What, however, could not escape notice from any angle was his infinite propensity to borrow money, which age could not wither nor — more surprisingly — custom stale. He might be cheated...so that resigning from the Secular Society he was loaded with debt. Yet this hardly accounts for his habit of borrowing from the rich, the poor and the positively indigent for trifling amounts — though sometimes cleaning them out — since he never at any time — and this in an age of ostentatious spenders... — lived in a style above that of any other middl-class socialist who had neither business interests nor inherited wealth. </p><p class="quote"> It is not uncommon to come across individuals from whose company and a small sum of money one simultaneously parts. This compulsion to borrow is not easy to explain in those who are neither on their beam ends nor aspire to high living." </p><p>Although he had numerous relationships with women, Edward Aveling is not known to have fathered any children.</p><p class="fst">For more on his political activities see the biography on <a href="../m/a.htm#marx-eleanor">Eleanor Marx</a>.</p><p class="fst">See also <a href="../../../archive/aveling/index.htm" target="_top">Edward Aveling Archive</a>.</p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../a.htm">Index of the Letter A</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

At sixteen she left home to attend De Pauw University in Asbury, Indiana, where she studied political science, languages, and literature. She graduated in 1897 and taught high school German until 1900 when she married Charles Austin Beard, whom she had met at De Pauw. Mary Beard accompanied her husband to Oxford, and both were active politically as well as academically. Charles helped organize Ruskin Hall, the "free university" aimed at workingmen, and Mary became involved with the British women’s suffrage movement. They returned to New York in 1902. Their daughter Miriam was born in 1903. The following year the Beards enrolled at Columbia University, but Mary quit soon after to take care of their child and volunteer for progressive causes.</p><p>Following the birth of her son William in 1907, Mary Beard became an organizer for the National Women’s Trade Union League. From 1910 to 1912 she edited the suffragist periodical <i>The Woman Voter</i>, and after that worked with the Wage Earner’s League. She was a member of the militant faction of the suffrage movement led by Alice Paul from 1913 to 1919, and she worked on several progressive causes. During this period, Charles taught at Columbia University, but he resigned in 1917 in protest of the firing of anti-war faculty. Charles helped establish the New School for Social Research (later joined by refugees from the Franfurt School) and both Beards helped found the Workers Education Bureau, but by the early 1920, the Beards generally worked outside of academic institutions.</p><p>Following her resignation from the National Woman’s Party in 1917, Mary Beard devoted her skills and efforts to writing and lecturing, rather than public political activity. Her first book, <i>Woman’s Work in Municipalities</i> (1915) and her second, A <i>Short History of the American Labor Movement</i> (1920), focused on social reform and the working class. With Charles, she co-authored <i>The Rise of American Civilization</i> (1927), a groundbreaking text that integrated political, economic, social, and cultural histories with a progressive vision of America’s past and distinctive national character. The two collaborated on several books that would become some of the most enduringly significant American history texts, but by herself, Mary pioneered the field of women’s history. She was appalled by the omission of women from the historical record, and she wrote about and promoted the recognition of women’s achievements in the present day and the past, in the U.S. and internationally. She authored and edited <i>Understanding Women</i> (1931), <i>America Through Women’s Eyes</i> (1933), <i>A Changing Political Economy as It Affects Women</i> (1934), and <i>Women as Force in History</i> (1946), among others.</p><p>Rather than concentrating on grievances and questions of the subjugation of women, Beard’s work promoted women’s contributions to the formation of society and brought to light a long-neglected past. To this end in the early 1930s, she collaborated with Hungarian pacifist feminist Rosika Schwimmer to organize the World Center for Women’s Archives (WCWA). Beard quoted French historian Fustel de Coulanges for the motto of the WCWA: "No documents, no history," and she envisioned an archive of women’s papers and organizational records that would provide a foundation for women’s history as an academic field as well as serve as a public good. Beard and Schwimmer raised funds, founded a board of directors, and collected documents from their network of women activists. The WCWA was headquartered in New York but collected on an international level. It was a well-publicized effort, and though the collection specialized in material from the pacifist movement, Beard worked to realize a broader conception for a collection representing the range of women’s activities. Factionalism among WCWA supporters, shaky financial support, and an increasingly militaristic atmosphere in the U.S. and abroad forced the dissolution of the WCWA in the early 1940s.</p><p>This development was very discouraging to Beard, but fortunately, the WCWA generated momentum for developing institutions of women’s history. Beard worked closely with Smith College archivist Margaret Grierson to create the Sophia Smith Collection, one of the world’s largest women’s history manuscript collections, founded in 1942, and she worked with Harvard historians to create the eventual Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. These two institutions received many of the WCWA documents, as did several smaller collections. Together, they carried on the WCWA mission, at least partly due to Beard’s influence.</p><p>Neither of the Beards avoided controversy in their writings or public stands. Though both were well-respected historians, they increasingly drew criticism for their pacifist and progressive politics in the years surrounding World War II. Charles Beard died in 1948, and Mary Ritter Beard died on 14 August 1958. Both Beards have had enduring reputations as incisive historians, and they are recognized for their pioneering work in social history. Mary Beard especially has been celebrated for her work to promote women’s history.</p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/beard/index.htm" target="_top">Mary Beard Archive</a>.</p>')

He emigrated to the United States in 1878 with his parents, settling near Bridgeport, Connecticut. From there he moved to Woodstock, Illinois in 1880, and then to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1881, where he was a schoolteacher and newspaper editor.</p><p>Berger was credited by trade union leader Eugene V.

As a souvenir of that visit there is in my library a volume of Capital by Karl Marx, inscribed with the compliments of Victor L. Berger, which I cherish as a token of priceless value."</p><p>In 1896 Berger was a delegate to the People’s Party Convention in St. Louis.</p><p>In 1897 he married a former student, Meta Schlichting. The couple raised two daughters, Doris and Elsa, who at first spoke only German in the home, indicative of their parent\'cultural orientation. Berger was short and stocky, with a studious demeanor, and had both a self-deprecating sense of humor and a volatile temper. Although loyal to friends, he was strongly opinionated and intolerant of dissenting views. His ideological sparring partner and comrade Morris Hillquit later recalled of Berger that</p><p>"He was sublimely egotistical, but somehow his egotism did not smack of conceit and was not offensive. It was the expression of deep and naive faith in himself, and this unshakable faith was one of the mainsprings of his power over men.".</p><p>Berger was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America in 1897 and led the split of the "political action" faction of that organization to form the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) in 1898.

Berger was regarded as one of the part\' leading revisionist Marxists, an advocate of the trade union-oriented and incremental politics of Edward Bernstein. He advocated the use of electoral politics to implement reforms and thus gradually build a collectivist society.</p><p>Berger was a man of the written word and back room negotiation, not a notable public speaker. He retained a heavy German accent and had a voice which did not project well. As a rule he did not accept outdoor speaking engagements and was a poor campaigner, preferring one-on-one relationships to mass oratory.Berger was, however, a newspaper editorialist par excellence. Throughout his life he published and edited a number of different papers, including the German language Vorwärts ("Forward") (1892-1911), the Social-Democratic Herald (1901-1913), and the Milwaukee Leader (1911-1929).

The debate was vitriolic, with Berger, somewhat unsurprisingly, stating the matter in its most bellicose form:</p><p class="quote">Comrades, the trouble with our party is that we have men in our councils who claim to be in favor of political action when they are not. We have a number of men who use our political organization — our Socialist Party — as a cloak for what they call direct action, for IWW-ism, sabotage and syndicalism. It is anarchism by a new name....<br />    Comrades, I have gone through a number of splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past. In the past we often had to fight utopianism and fanaticism. Now it is anarchism again that is eating away at the vitals of our party.<br />    If there is to be a parting of the ways, if there is to be a split — and it seems that you will have it, and must have it — then, I am ready to split right here. I am ready to go back to Milwaukee and appeal to the Socialists all over the country to cut this cancer out of our organization."</p><p>The regulars won the day handily at the Indianapolis convention of 1912, with a successful recall of IWW leader "Big Bill" Haywood from the S\' National Executive Committee and an exodus of disaffected left wingers following shortly thereafter. The remaining radicals in the party remembered bitterly Berge\' role in this affair and the ill feelings continued to fester until erupting anew at the end of the decade.</p><p><strong>Berger and World War I</strong></p><p>Berge\' views on World War I were complicated by the Socialist view and the difficulties surrounding his German heritage. However, he did support his part\' stance against the war. When the United States entered the war and passed the Espionage Act in 1917, Berge\' continued opposition made him a target. He and four other Socialists were indicted under the Espionage Act in February 1918; the trial followed on December 9 of that year, and on February 20, 1919, Berger was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The trial was presided over by Judge Kenesaw Landis, who later became the first commissioner of Major League Baseball. His conviction was appealed, and ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court on January 31, 1921, which found that Judge Landis had improperly presided over the case after the filing of an affidavit of prejudice.</p><p>In spite of his being under indictment at the time, the voters of Milwaukee elected Berger to the House of Representatives in 1918. When he arrived in Washington to claim his seat, Congress formed a special committee to determine whether a convicted felon and war opponent should be seated as a member of Congress. On November 10, 1919 they concluded that he should not, and declared the seat vacant. Wisconsin promptly held a special election to fill the vacant seat, and on December 19, 1919, elected Berger a second time. On January 10, 1920, the House again refused to seat him, and the seat remained vacant until 1921, when Republican William H. Stafford claimed the seat after defeating Berger in the 1920 general election.Second stint in Congress</p><p>Berger defeated Stafford in 1922 and was reelected in 1924 and 1926. In those terms, he dealt with Constitutional changes, a proposed old-age pension, unemployment insurance, and public housing. He also supported the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. After his defeat by Stafford in 1928, he returned to Milwaukee and resumed his career as a newspaper editor.</p><p>On July 16, 1929 Berger was struck by a streetcar at the corner of 3rd and Clarke Streets in Milwaukee. The accident fractured his skull, and he died of his injuries on August 7, 1929. Prior to burial at Forest Home Cemetery his body lay in state at City Hall and was viewed by 75,000 citizens of the city.</p><p><strong>Writings</strong></p><p>Victor Berge\' journalism was voluminous, but rarely reproduced in book or pamphlet form. A massive number of editorials were produced for the pages of the paper he edited, the Milwaukee Leader. In addition, two books collecting Berge\' writings were published, Berge\' Broadsides (1912), and Voice and Pen of Victor L. Berger: Congressional Speeches and Editorials (1929). Victor Berge\' papers are housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society, as is the complete run of the Milwaukee Leader on microfilm.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../archive/berger-victor/index.htm" target="_top">Victor Berger Archive</a>.</p><p> </p>')

That neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas forms by the imagination exist without mind is what everybody will allow ... and to me it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the senses, however blended or combined together cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them”.</p><p class="quote">“It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing among men that houses, mountains, rivers and in a word, all sensible objects, have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding ... For what are the aforementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? And what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations?

[from <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/berkeley.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Of the Principles of Human Understanding</span></a>]</p><p>In other words, he said to the empiricists: ‘You know that sensations exist, but you know not of anything beyond; sensation are acting only upon senses’. Berkeley <em>proved</em> that empiricism leads to subjective idealism. In order to explain the existence of knowledge at all, Berkeley invented a special new sense which is able to sense “notions,” thus leading back to religion.</p><p>Berkeley’s subjective idealist attack on materialism, purporting to show that the assertion that something exists outside the mind of the individual human being is absurd, useless and unprovable, was in fact a great service to the development of materialism. This can be said because Berkeley drew to its “logical conclusion” the development of empiricism. </p><p><a href="../../people/b/a.htm#bacon-francis">Bacon</a> asserted, as a materialist, that we had to use our eyes, ears and hands and go <em>out</em> to <em>Nature</em> to discover truth. Hobbes and Locke developed Bacon’s “empiricism” in the narrow sense, by reducing the investigation of Nature to experience to sense perception, equating sense perception with ideas, and ultimately equating the rational faculty as a whole with the action of the external world on the senses, with sense perception. </p><p>Berkeley shows that this line of development leads to knowledge only of phenomena, in the form of sensations, not the essence of things existing outside of and independently of our perception of us. Perception has become, not people’s <em>connection</em> with Nature, but a <em>barrier</em> sealing us off from Nature absolutely. The <em>logical conclusion</em> of empiricism is <em>subjective idealism</em>.</p><p>Berkeley avoids outright "solipsism" by adding to his thesis, that the God can perceive sensations independently of us, thus allowing "things" to exist while we are not actually looking at them. This unconvincing objective idealist "correction" to his otherwise consistent subjective idealism grew more significant in the course of his development. </p><p>Nevertheless, Berkeley’s insane conclusions are generally accepted as the last word on the question of matter for the French, British and American traditions of idealist philosophy for a long time afterwards. </p><p>In order to develop further, <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism">materialism</a> had to find an answer to Berkeley’s challenge.</p>')

Alongside others, Blake is considered a key forerunner to modern left-wing ideas which emerged after the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution of 1789. </p><p>William Blake, was an English/British printmaker and poet who contributed both in the arts and to British radical politics during the 1700s and early 1800s. Mostly ignored and forgotten in his own times, Blake was a key figure in the Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century and an important figure in British literary history and radical history. An artisan printmaker for the majority of his life, Blake produced both excellent paintings, prints and print works, alongside some of the finest Romantic poetry written in English. Alongside this Blake was a political radical for his times, being a democrat, a republican, a supporter of the American Revolution and the French Revolution, a free thinker, a critic of industrial capitalism, a fierce opponent of slavery, empire and imperialism, a champion of free love and women’s rights, and committed to a proto form of Anarchism and of Socialism. In political terms Blake was influenced by the radical tradition of English religion, dating back to the radical wing of the English Revolution of 1640. Blake was a left-wing radical and is still respected today within the British Left and the British Radical movement. For his poetic and artistic work, Blake is still revered as one of the best figures produced by the Romantic tradition in British literary history. His poetry is known for integrating religious themes with social criticism, alongside romantic impulses. </p><p>Blake was born on 28 November 1757, in Soho, London, United Kingdom, into an artisanal family who worked in hosiery.

A socialist that favored reforms, he called for the creation of procedure cooperatives in order to guarantee employment for the city poor.</p><p><strong>Early years</strong></p><p>He was born in Madrid, his father held the post of inspector-general of finance under Joseph Bonaparte. Failing to receive aid from Pozzo di Borgo, his mothe\' uncle, Louis Blanc studied law in Paris, living in povertyagi, and became a contributor to various journals. In the Revue du progres, which he founded, he published in 1839 his study on \'rganisation du travail. The principles laid down in this famous essay form the key to Louis Blan\' whole political career. He attributes all the evils that afflict society to the pressure of competition, whereby the weaker are driven to the wall. He demanded the equalization of wages, and the merging of personal interests in the common good-- "à chacun selon ses besoins, de chacun selon ses facultés," which is often translated as "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs." This was to be affected by the establishment of "social workshops," a sort of combined co-operative society and trade-union, where the workmen in each trade were to unite their efforts for their common benefit. In 1841 he published his Histoire de dix ans 1830-1840, an attack upon the monarchy of July. It ran through four editions in four years.</p><p> <strong>The Revolution of 1848</strong></p><p>In 1847 he published the two first volumes of his Histoire de la Revolution Française. Its publication was interrupted by the Revolution of 1848, when Louis Blanc became a member of the provisional government. It was on his motion that, on 25 February, the government undertook "to guarantee the existence of the workmen by work"; and though his demand for the establishment of a ministry of labour was refused—as beyond the competence of a provisional government—he was appointed to preside over the government labour commission (Commission du Gouvernement pour les travailleurs) established at the Palace Luxembourg to inquire into and report on the labour question.</p><p>The revolution of 1848 was the real chance for Louis Blanc’s ideas to be implemented. His theory of using the established government to enact change was different from those of other socialist theorists of his time. Blanc believed that workers could control their own livelihoods, but knew that unless they were given help to get started the cooperative workshops would never work. To assist this process along Blanc lobbied for national funding of these workshops until the workers could assume control. To fund this ambitious project, Blanc saw a ready revenue source in the rail system. Under government control the railway system would provide the bulk of the funding needed for this and other projects Blanc saw in the future.</p><p> When the workshop program was ratified in the national assembly, Blanc’s chief rival Emile Thomas was put in control of the project. The national assembly was not ready for this type of social program and treated the workshops as a method of buying time until the assembly could gather enough support to stabilize themselves against another worker rebellion. Emile Thomas’s deliberate failure in organizing the workshops into a success only seemed to anger the public more. The people had been promised a job and a working environment in which the workers were in charge, from these government funded programs. What they had received was hand outs and government funded work parties to dig ditches and hard manual labor for meager wages or paid to remain idle. When the workshops were closed the workers rebelled again but were put down by force by the national guard. The national assembly was also able to blame Blanc for the failure of the workshops. His ideas were questioned and he lost much of the respect which had given him influence with the public.</p><p>Between the "sans-culottes", who tried to force him to place himself at their head, and the national guards, who mistreated him, he was nearly killed. Rescued with difficulty, he escaped with a false passport to Belgium, and then to London. In his absence he was condemned by a special tribunal at Bourges, in contumaciam, to deportation. Against trial and sentence he alike protested, developing his protest in a series of articles in the Nouveau Monde, a review published in Paris under his direction. These he afterwards collected and published as Pages de \'istoire de la révolution de 1848 (Brussels, 1850).</p><p> <strong>Exile</strong></p><p>During his stay in Britain he made use of the unique collection of materials for the revolutionary period preserved at the British Museum to complete his Histoire de la Revolution Française 12 vols. (1847-1862). In 1858 he published a reply to Lord Normanb\' A Year of Revolution in Paris (1858), which he developed later into his Histoire de la révolution de 1848 (2 vols., 1870-1880). He was also active in the irregular masonic organisation, the Conseil Supreme de l’Ordre Maconnique de Memphis. His membership in the London-based La Grand Loge des Philadelphes is unconfirmed.</p><p><strong> Return to France</strong></p><p>As far back as 1839 Louis Blanc had vehemently opposed the idea of a Napoleonic restoration, predicting that it would be "despotism without glory," "the Empire without the Emperor." He therefore remained in exile until the fall of the Second Empire in September 1870, after which he returned to Paris and served as a private in the national guard. On 8 February 1871 he was elected a member of the National Assembly, in which he maintained that the republic was "the necessary form of national sovereignty," and voted for the continuation of the war; yet, though a leftist, he did not sympathize with the Paris Commune, and exerted his influence in vain on the side of moderation. In 1878 he advocated the abolition of the presidency and the Senate. In January 1879 he introduced into the chamber a proposal for the amnesty of the Communards, which was carried. This was his last important act. His declining years were darkened by ill-health and by the death, in 1876, of his wife Christina Groh, whom he had married in 1865. He died at Cannes, and on 12 December received a state funeral in the Père Lachaise.</p><p> <strong>His political legacy</strong></p><p>Louis Blanc possessed a picturesque and vivid style, and considerable power of research; but the fervour with which he expressed his convictions, while placing him in the first rank of orators, tended to turn his historical writings into political pamphlets. His political and social ideas have had a great influence on the development of socialism in France. His Discours politiques (1847-1881) was published in 1882. his most important works, besides those already mentioned, are Lettres sur \'ngleterre (1866-1867), Dix années de \'istoire de \'ngleterre (1879-1881), and Questions \'ujour\'ui et de demain (1873-1884).</p><p>V.I.

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Bland, William “Bill” (1916-2001)', 'glossary/people/b/pics/bland-bill.jpg', 'Bill Bland was born in the North of England, into a middle class home. He spent his politically formative years in the army of New Zealand, where he was active in the Communist Party as an educator. He returned to Britain in the post-war years as an ophthalmic optician. In the 1950’s Bland witnessed the Communist Party of Great Britain embracing the  “Peaceful Road to Socialism", and Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin. Bland believed these “revisionist” stances were incorrect and anti-Marxist-Leninist. </p><p>Bland therefore became  a member of several anti-revisionist formations in Britain. He soon joined forces with Mike Baker in the Marxist-Leninist Organisation of Britain (MLOB). Shortly thereafter, the ‘Cultural Revolution’ occured in China, and prompted by a barrage of questions, Bland undertook a systematic study of Mao. He found that he could not agree with Mao’s theory of the ‘New Democratic State’; and penned within months, the first refutation of Mao from the point of view of a pro-Stalin supporter. At that time, the MLOB rapidly dwindled in size as many members retained affection of Mao. This was to be the first of Bland’s many un-popular analyses in the pro-Stalin wing of the Communist movement. </p><p>Bland spent the rest of his life trying to answer the question: “How had revisionism become ascendant?”</p><p>Bland came to the conclusion that <a href="../../people/s/t.htm#stalin-josef">Stalin</a> had been in a minority position in the Politburo, surrounded by hidden revisionists too clever to openly attack Marxism-Leninism; further, they had straight-jacketed Stalin by means of erecting the “Cult of Personality,” which was then used as a weapon against him. Bland felt that Yezhov had subverted the secret services, who had been replaced at Stalin’s behest by Beria. Bland pointed for example, to the release of many thousands of wrongly imprisoned Bolsheviks. Bland then argued  that by the 18th Party Congress Stalin had been excluded from the highest echelons of the party decision making apparatus, and had counter-attacked with his pamphlet “Economic Problems of the USSR.”</p> <p>Stalin’s essay was a seminal attack on Nikolai Vosnosensky, who was linked to <a href="../../people/k/h.htm#khrushchev-nikita">Khrushchev</a>. Cosequently argued Bland, the later economic changes re-establishing capitalism in the USSR had been fought to a standstill by Stalin. Bland therefore argued a special significance for  Stalin’s last work. As Bland saw it,  once Stalin was dead, the capitalist “reforms” of Vosnosensky were enacted by Khrushchev and his successors. He formulated these views in articles that culminated in the book ‘Restoration of Capitalism in the USSR’, published in 1981. </p><p>Follwing his analysis of Maoism as ‘left revisionism’, Bland began to question his own long-standing support for the then pro-Chinese Party of Labour of Albania, but concluded that the People’s Socialist Republic of Albania remained socialist. Before the 20th party Congress of the CPSU, Bland had founded the Albanian Society of Britain, at the invitation of the PSRA.  Despite now being officially ostracized by Albania, Bland continued his work running the Albanian Society, and organizing an enormous education on this isolated solitary socialist country. In those years, he became an acknowledged authority on all things Albanian. He published an English-Albanian dictionary and he fielded any manner of queries upon arcane features of Albanian life, history, music, foods, geography, customs and mores etc. </p><p>While China was supported by the Albanian party, some of the Maoist parties had run an explicit party front Albania Society, resisting Bland’s call for one single, united front Albania Society, regardless of ‘narrow’ party affiliation. Following <a href="../../people/h/o.htm#hoxha-enver">Hoxha</a>’s open attack on Mao, some of these Societies split and some died. Their remaining members were correctly advised by the foreign Liaison committee of the PSRA, to join with Bland’s organisation to form one United Front of support for the PSRA. But they launched attempts to remove Bland’s leadership, charging that an emphasis on all aspects of life – such as music etc – was “anti-Marxist-Leninist,” and “insufficiently political,” and that Bland  should be removed. The membership rejected this attempt to remove Bland. The Society continued till the revisionist take-over of the PSRA by Ramiz Alia, at which point Bland resigned from the Albania Society. </p><p>It was primarily differences over Bland’s analysis of Albania as Socialist that precipitated the split in the MLOB in 1975, following which, the Communist League came into existence. The Communist League from its inception always supported the Peoples Socialist Republic of Albania as a solitary socialist state. Those that stayed with the MLOB, including Mike Baker and his supporters, rejected that position.</p><p>One specific aspect of modern revisionism, to which Bland paid close attention, was the subversion of the second stage of socialist revolution, into a static national democratic deviations. For Bland, this represented a distortion from the Marxist-Leninist theory of the nation. Into these categories, Bland placed the pseudo-‘socialist’ revolutions of China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and Tanzania. He argued that all of these had ignored Lenin’s injunction not to build a ‘Chinese Wall’ between the first (national democratic) stage of revolution and the second (socialist) stage. Bland also argued that other, phenomena such as the “Black Nation” in the USA, “Black Racism” and “Scottish, Welsh and Cornish Nationalism", in Britain, represented national deviations away from socialist revolution.</p><p>These views led him to challenge fundamental Stalinist premises: If the Soviet Union had been permeated by a class war involving the highest echelons of the Party, was the <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international">Comintern</a> any different? </p><p>Bland puzzled over several related matters: Why had the Comintern performed so many about-turns on key questions such as the nature of the United Front? Was Stalin really ‘in control’ of the Comintern? Why had the Peoples Front governments been supported beyond any credible point by European communist parties, especially in France, in assisting a fascist take-over? And why did the ultra-left rejections of a united front of the late 1920’s swing suddenly into ultra-right distortions of a correct United Front policy? Etc. </p><p>Bland argued that the first ultra-left deviations in the Comintern, in the period from about 1924 to 1928 had allowed fascism to take power in Germany. In the same period, under the cover of this ultra-leftism, Manuilsky and Kussinen had destroyed the Indian revolution by sabotaging Stalin’s line of the Workers and Peasants parties. Bland thought that the second right deviations, from about 1930 onwards had prevented the masses of Europe taking power under Communist Party direction. </p><p>Bland now further argued that Stalin had not been in a leadership position in the Comintern since around 1924; as follows: Initially <a href="../../people/z/i.htm#zinoviev">Zinoviev</a> had exercised the leadership, and thereafter <a href="../../people/b/u.htm#bukharin-nikolai">Bukharin</a>. When both were exposed as "revisionists" they were purged from further influencing the Comintern. Both were later shot. Thereafter <a href="../../people/d/i.htm#dimitrov-georgi">Dimitrov</a>, Otto Kuusinen, and Dimitri Manuilskii exercised the Comintern leadership. Bland argued they had perverted a correct implementation of Marxism-Leninism. Dimitrov had been sprung from the German Fascist prisons thanks to a rather dubious, and surprising “leniency” of the German fascists. “Why?”, asked Bland, replying that a pact had been struck; as shown when Dimitrov went on to subvert United Front tactics into the right deviation of supporting “Popular Front” governments beyond Marxist-Leninist principles of the correct United Front tactics. </p><p>It was for these reasons, argued Bland, that the Comintern was dissolved by Stalin. Stalin then created the Cominform under a completely different leadership, led by his most trusted lieutenants such as Zhdanov. It must be remembered, said Bland, that it was the Cominform that had exposed the Western Communist parties plans for implementing right deviationist policies, and the Titoites for allying with the USA. During this latter historic confrontation Stalin overtly supported Albania and Hoxha against <a href="../../people/t/i.htm#tito-broz">Tito</a>. </p><p>Apart from his theoretical works, Bland wrote a number of plays, directed two films, and created a ballet. A life-long intense love of the arts – especially cinema and the theatre – led him to re-affirm the principles of Socialist Realist Art. He wrote widely on theatre and film, and on the history of theatre. </p><p>In Britain he led the Communist League to urge the principled unity of all Marxist-Leninist forces, hence Bland’s role in the early stages of the National Committee for A Marxist-Leninist Unity (NCMLU). Bland also formed the Stalin Soicety in the UK. But the pro-China factions within the Stalin Society that ensured Bland’s later expulsion.  He was a key figure in the formation of the International Struggle Marxist-Leninist, and was cited as a major influence by <a href="https://ml-review.ca/aml/index.html" target="_top">Alliance Marxist-Leninist (North America)</a>. </p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../archive/bland/index.htm" target="_top">Bill Bland Reference Archive</a>.</p><p class="inline">by Hari Kumar</p>')

Blanqui neither cared for economic nor social/historical theory, but dedicated his heart and mind to the theory and practice of worker\'revolution. Blanqui recognized, as a result of extreme police persecution, that a successful workers revolution in 19th-century France could only be led by a small group of disciplined workers.</p><p>         At 13 years old, Blanqui had moved to Paris to live with his older brother, Adolphe.  In Paris Blanqui studied law and medicine until 1824; completing his education when he was 19 years old. Beginning in 1827, he took an active part in students demonstrations against the restored Bourbon monarchy, which he followed through to the Revolution of July 1830 (which had established to the monarchy of Louis-Philippe). Outraged by all the blood workers had spilled in the preceding years to see it commadered by an autocrat convinced Blanqui of the need for a workers revolution.</p><p>A member of the Society of Friends of the People (Société des Amis du Peuple), Blanqui was first imprisoned in 1831, and again in 1836 as a result of his association with this illegal society. As these acts of extreme police persecution, workers movements could only exist as small, disciplined and secretive societies. Having clear vision, Blanqui (much like <a href="../../people/l/e.htm#lenin">Lenin</a>) concluded that only extremely disciplined workers could achieve workers revolution in those conditions.</p><p>Blanqui organized the Society of the Seasons (Société des Saisons) and attempted an armed instruction on May 12, 1839 against the Hôtel de Ville (the City Hall) of Paris. Isolated both physically and politically from Paris workers, the 500 armed revolutionaries were slaughtered in less than two days of fighting.

His all-too frequent stays in prison earned him the name <em>\'nfermé</em> (the locked-up one). Blanqui did not return to Paris until the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 began.</p><p>After Napoleon III capitulated at the <a href="../../events/s/e.htm#sedan-battle">Battle of Sedan</a>, and the siege of Paris began, Blanqui agitated against Prussian occupation of France, suggesting how Paris should best defend itself. On October 31, 1870, Blanqui lead revolutionaries to attempt to overthrow the government, and succeeded in capturing the Hôtel de Ville and set up a government with Blanqui at its head. Just a day later, however, the government stormed the Hotel and arrested Blanqui and many of other revolutionary leaders for treason.

Debs and Victor Berger — a group which would later emerge as the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She later recalled:</p><p class="quote">    "When I joined the Social Democracy I was living in Brooklyn and I had married for the second time. My husband, Louis Cohen, was a socialist. I was pregnant with the first of the two children of that marriage. The railroad men [Debs supporters] came to my house so I could continue to act as [local] secretary.</p><p class="quote">    "But a new disappointment was in store for me. The Social Democracy, I soon discovered, was a utopian scheme. Debs’ plan was to form an ideal colony out West to show by example that socialism could work. From the outset I told the members of my group that this colonization scheme was unsound, not real socialism at all. I stayed with it for a while because of my loyalty to Debs, and because this was the nearest thing I had yet found to a socialist movement.</p><p class="quote">    "Debs set up a paper in Chicago called  <em>The Social Democrat</em>. At his request I wrote a children’s column for it. The children answered the appeals of Debs and his colonization committee by sending me money. I felt it was unfair to collect money for something that did not yet exist. People were already selling out businesses to join the colony. A national convention was held in Chicago [June 7-11, 189 and our local sent delegates. Among them was my husband who still felt that anything Debs was in must be all right. I agreed to withhold final judgment until the delegates returned. When they came back and reported that plans to establish the colony would continue, I resigned. I simply could not stay with anything so unscientific.</p><p>Shortly after her resignation from the Social Democracy, Ella attended a meeting in New York of the Socialist Labor Party, at which editor of the party newspaper Daniel DeLeon was the speaker:</p> <p class="quote">    "He was small and slight and prematurely gray, and spoke very deliberately and convincingly.</p><p class="quote">    "The Socialist Labor Party was a revolutionary party in those days and DeLeon, its leader, was a brilliant theoretician and speaker, a courageous fighter against capitalism.... I was impressed with his analysis of the evils of the capitalist system, and of the fallacy of isolated socialist colonies as a way of achieving socialism. I felt that at last here was scientific socialism and joined the SLP.</p><p class="quote">    "Daniel DeLeon and I became friends.... I became very much interested in the New York Labor News Company — the first organization that published revolutionary books and pamphlets in English on a large scale. Its manager was Julien Pierce. Together we proofread the pamphlets translated by DeLeon, often having o reconstruct the English, a greater task than we ever let him know."</p><p>Ella was elected to the governing General Executive Board of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (ST&LA), the SLP’s trade union affiliate. She was also the ST&LA’s organizer for Essex County, New Jersey and was sent to Philadelphia by the organization in an effort to organize street car workers there.</p><p>Ella recounted her growing disaffection with the SLP in her 1940 memoir:</p><p class="quote">    "Gradually the defects of the SLP were brought home to me. I found many workers antagonistic because I was organizing a rival union. The STLA was weakening the AF of L by drawing off its more radical elements and leaving the reactionaries in control, and was itself organized on too narrow and sectarian a basis to accomplish anything. Furthermore, the SLP as a political party had little real influence because DeLeon was against taking part in the immediate struggles of the workers.... I began very early to see the importance of a united trade union movement, and felt that Socialists should work within the AF of L. I felt that DeLeon understood Marx very well abstractly but knew little about the practical needs of the labor movement.</p><p class="quote">    "The last time I talked with DeLeon I told him I was moving to Philadelphia and was willing to accept the secretaryship of the SLP local there, which had been offered me, but I could not go along with their principles wholeheartedly. As a good friend of mine, DeLeon accepted what I said without anger, but would not change his methods."</p><p>Soon after her arrival in Philadelphia, a state convention of the SLP decided to leave the party en masse to form a new organization in the nether region between Morris Hillquit’s dissident so-called "Kangaroo" faction which broke away in 1899 and DeLeon’s hardline SLP. Ella opposed this new organization, which called itself "The Logical Center" and included Lucien Sanial, a former top official in the SLP. Ella had been watching with interest the formation of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1901 and decided to leave her new Pennsylvania comrades to rejoin her friend Gene Debs as a member of his new organization.</p><p>In subsequent years, Ella worked as a trade union organizer and helped during industrial disputes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and New York. In 1905 she helped a fellow member of the Socialist Party of America, the author, Upton Sinclair, to gather information on the Chicago stock yards. This material eventually appeared in Sinclair’s best-selling book, The Jungle. Rumour has it that Sinclair sent her along with a Mr. Bloor as a faux couple to be able to innocently gather data on the meat yards of Chicago. Although they were not married, Ella adopted the name Mother Bloor.</p><p>A leading figure in the Socialist Party of America, she ran several times unsuccessfully for political office, including secretary of state for Connecticut, Governor of Pennsylvania, and Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1918.</p><p>Ella Reeve Bloor was an adherent of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of America exited that organization form the Communist Labor Party. In 1921 and 1922 attended the second conventions of the Comintern in Moscow. She was also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party USA from 1932 to 1948.</p><p>After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Bloor became an advocate of American participation in World War II.

He was a guiding spirit and major contributor to the development of quantum physics; leader of the renowned Copenhagen School which struggled to work out a consistent materialist understanding of physical science during the unfolding of quantum and relativistic discoveries, Bohr maintained a long dialogue with Einstein over the meaning of these developments, and is responsible for the <em>Correspondence Principle</em>, one of the most important concepts for the understanding of the relation between quantum events and experience in the “macro-world”.</p><p>Bohr was brought up in a wealthy and influential Copenhagen family, his father a renowned physiologist and his brother a mathematician. After completing his doctorate in the electron theory of metal at the University of Copenhagn, Bohr joined J.J. Thomson at Cambridge, but in 1912 joined Rutherford’s in Manchester, a group studying the structure of the atom.</p><p>It was here that Bohr worked on the theoretical implications of Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom and he was among the first to see the importance of the number of electrons in an atom’s structure in determining the physical and chemical properties of an element. Bohr was the first to see that a stable atomic structure was possible if energy levels were inherently restricted to discrete levels, a possibility made conceiveable by Max Planck’s discovery of the discrete properties of radiation spectra. Bohr succeeded in deriving the observed line spectrum of light emitted by atomic hydrogen from an analysis of the electron structure of the hydrogen atom.</p><p>Bohr returned to Copenhagen in 1912, and was appointed to a professorship from which position he led research into the fundamental quantum physics for the rest of his life, with many of the great physicists of the period, including <a href="../h/e.htm#heisenberg-werner">Werner Heisenberg</a> coming to work in Copenhagen.</p><p>It is difficult to imagine the situation in which physicists were working in this period as research continued to produce mathematical entities which defied any attempt to visualise there physical meaning, other than being part of equations which accurately predicted experimental results, and indeed the experimental results themselves seemed to totally defy logical comprehension.</p><p>During the early 1920s, Bohr to piece together the theory of sub-atomic behaviour based on the quantum conception, and perhaps his most important achievement was the formulation of two general principles which he used to guide the interpretation of quantum theory: the <em>Complementarity Principle</em> and the application of the <em>Correspondence Principle</em> first developed by Einstein in his formulation of Relativity.</p><p>According to the Correspondence Principle, as applied by Einstein, the predictions of Relativistic equations had to <em>converge</em> to those of Newtonian mechanics, for small speeds and masses; in application to quantum mechanics, Bohr held that there had to be a correspondence between each ‘energy jump’ predicted by the quantum hypothesis and the frequency of light emissions observable and describable by classical mechanics, given that the frequency of light is related to its energy by a fixed ratio, Planck’s constant.</p><p>According to the Complementarity Principle, a quantum interaction must be describable in terms of wave-concepts <em>and</em> in terms of particle-concepts, and the two descriptions are together taken as a complete description of the properties of the interacting objects, despite the fact that no interaction can simultaneously correlate with both systems of concepts completely.</p><p>In the early years, Bohr stressed the tentative and symbolic nature of the atomic models that were being used, but as the theory continued to consolidate he came to the view that quantum mechanics was a valid representation of reality, and that the statistical interpretation of the field equation had to be accepted as a complete description of a system, rather than indicating the action of an as yet undiscovered type of interaction.</p><p>While Bohr’s view has come to be accepted by the great majority of physicists, <a href="../../people/e/i.htm#einstein-albert">Albert Einstein</a> retained his assertion that the quantum theory offered an incomplete description of physical reality to the end, and looked forward to the development of a Unified Field Theory to provide the hoped-for complete description.</p><p>In <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm" target="_top">his account of his discussions with Einstein</a>, Bohr emphasised how important Einstein’s challenging objections had been to the evolution of his own ideas and what a deep and lasting impression they had made on him and there is no doubt that this respect was reciprocated by Einstein.</p><p>During the 1930s Bohr continued to work on the epistemological problems raised by the quantum theory and also contributed to nuclear physics.

The man commonly referred to as SimÃ³n BolÃ­var was post-mortem considered to be a revolutionary hero in former Gran Colombia nations, yet was scrutinised heavily by Karl Marx.</p><p>BolÃ­var was reared in Caracas, Venezuela in an aristocratic family of noble Basque descent. He was the youngest of three children, whom were raised mostly by his family slave Hipolita. BolÃ­var’s father Coronel Don Juan Vicente BolÃ­var y Ponte died when he was two years of age, and after his mother Maria Juanita Cabeza Grande died when he was eight years of age. After which, BolÃ­var passed under the guardianship of many tutors and professors, specifically Don SimÃ³n Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the most influential in transmitting enlightened philosophy and ideas to BolÃ­var, in particular those of Liberalism, Free Trade, and Republicanism.</p><p>At the age of 14 BolÃ­var enlisted in the military academy of Veraguas in Panama after Rodriguez was accused of conspiracy against the Spanish crown. At the age of 21 he witnessed the coronation of Napoleon in Paris. It is said that his vehemence for Latin American emancipation is a fruition of this event. BolÃ­var returned to Venezuela in 1807 and after a successful junta, and the formation of the United Provinces of New Granada in 1810, was given command of the nation’s army, with the sole aim of ejecting Spanish presence in Latin America. After the failed establishment of a Venezuelan Republic in 1812, BolÃ­var wrote the <em>Cartagena Manifesto</em> which outlined his opinions concerning the causes of its fall – specifically the use of federalism, republicanism, and the Roman Catholic Church, all of which he viewed as opponents to a state in the time of war.</p><p>In 1813 BolÃ­var launched offensives in Venezuela (known as the Admirable Campaign), where he was bestowed the informal title of <em>El Liberator</em> after a restoration of the Venezuelan Republic. This republic was short lived, when it was reinstated in monarchist hands after a rebellion led by JosÃ© TomÃ¡s Boves in 1814. After putting down a republican rebellion in Bogota which soon rose again, he was forced to reinforce the area with assistance from a foreign army in 1815. After pleading in Jamaica and failing, he managed to gain the support of Alexandre PÃ©tion, the leader of newly independent Haiti. It is here that it is debated whether BolÃ­var was previously opposed to slavery or whether he only opposed it after his meeting with PÃ©tion, but it is certain that PÃ©tion would not supply reinforcements if BolÃ­var continued to support slavery.</p><p>In 1817 BolÃ­var and his Haitian soldiers initiated the independence campaign for Gran Colombia which was won at the Battle of BoyacÃ¡ in 1819. From a consolidated base in Gran Colombia BolÃ­var defeated the Royalist forces of Venezuela at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 and Ecuador at the Battle of Pichincha in 1822. The new empire of Gran Colombia inevitably had BolÃ­var as its president.</p><p>In 1824 BolÃ­var conquered Peru and was named Dictator of Peru by the Peruvian Congress. After the Battle of Ayacucho all Spanish forces in Latin America were annihilated. BolÃ­var at the Congress of Upper Peru in 1825 declared the creation of the Republic of BolÃ­via, one of the few countries to be named after a man.</p><p>Though the constitution of BolÃ­via reflected French and Scottish Enlightenment values, as well as those of classical philosophy, BolÃ­var moved to pen a new constitution of all Gran Colombia in response to a number of rebellions in Venezuela. The constitution allowed him presidency for life of a Centralized Gran Colombian state, as well as the right to select a successor. In theory the presidency was under congressional control by a system of checks and balances.</p><p>Debates at this time in the Convention of Ocana in early 1828 appeared to favour a more Republican Federalist style of government, yet BolÃ­varian delegates withdrew from the Convention as a reaction, thus making the Convention redundant. As a last resort to achieve his aims, BolÃ­var declared himself dictator through the <em>Decree of Dictatorship</em> in August, 1828. This was a move intended to consolidate central power over all of Gran Colombia, which would theoretically be only temporary. He was almost a victim of an assassination attempt, and eventually overwhelming rebellion in New Grenada, Venezuela and Ecuador forced him into exile in 1830. He resigned his presidency yet died as a result of tuberculosis in Santa Marta, New Grenada before departing on December 17, 1830.</p><p>In a February 14, 1858 letter to Engels, Marx describes BolÃ­var as the “dastardly, most miserable and meanest of blackguards,” and sarcastically remarks that to “[describe him] as Napoleon I was altogether too much. Bolivar is a veritable Soulouque (the former slave, later President of Haiti).” It is clear that BolÃ­var can easily be described as a Bonapartist, yet is considered by many contemporary Latin Americans (as well as most Latin Americans since the 1840s) as the liberator of their nations – even though their nations exist as a result of uprisings against his centralized Imperial Gran Colombian body. Venezuela, for example is officially a Bolivarian republic. Consequently, it can be concluded that BolÃ­var is a modern symbol of Liberty for Latin Americans regardless of his Imperial Bonapartist tendencies. This tendency towards the usage of BolÃ­var as a symbol of Liberty is displayed in the Argentinean Trotskyist Nahuel Moreno’s opinion that:</p><p class="indentb">“Bolivar’s thinking was the most advanced and internationalist of the first Latin American struggles for independence, thinking that today is continued in proletarian internationalism of the most advanced revolutionaries in Latin America, the Trotskyists.”</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> BolÃ­var is portrayed by Marx in a manner which was deemed to be written in a ‘partisan style’ by the managing editor of the <em>New York Tribune</em> Charles Dana in this article: Karl Marx in the <em>New American Encyclopedia</em> 1858: <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1858/01/bolivar.htm" target="_top"><em>Bolivar y Ponte</em></a>.

Boudin was born Louis Boudianoff in imperial Russia on December 15, 1874. He was born into a middle-class family, the son of a shirt manufacturer. The family emigrated to America in 1891 and settled in New York City. Louis worked in the garment industry as a shirtmaker and as a private tutor. At the same time, Boudin began legal studies, gaining a Master’s Degree from New York University and being admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1898.</p><p><strong>Political career</strong></p><p>In America, Boudin was first a member of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). He was a member of the governing National Executive Board of the SLP’s trade union affialiate, the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (ST&LA) from 1898 to 1899. Boudin was also a delegate to the United Hebrew Trades organization in New York City at that same time.</p><p>Boudin wrote his first political articles in the Yiddish language, contributing works on aesthetics and the materialist conception of history (historical materialism) to such publications as <em>Di Zukunft</em> and <em>Di Naye Geist</em>.</p><p>Boudin left the Socialist Labor Party during the party fight of 1899, casting his lot with the dissident faction headed by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin. This dissident SLP organization would eventually become one of the main pillars of the new Socialist Party of America, established in the summer of 1901.</p><p>From May 1905 through October 1906, Boudin wrote a series of articles expounding upon Marxism which were published in the Chicago magazine <em>The International Socialist Review</em>. These articles were collected in book form as <em>The Theoretical System of Karl Marx in the Light of Recent Criticism</em> in February 1907.The title was published by the leading radical publishing house of the day, Charles H. Kerr & Co., and was kept in print continuously over the next two decades through several reissue editions. The book, a defense of such orthodox Marxist tenanets as the labor theory of value and historical materialism against their critics of the day, established Boudin’s place as one of the foremost American authorities on Marxism among a generation of young political activists.</p><p>Boudin was elected a delegate of the Socialist Party of America to the 1907 Stuttgart Congress and the 1910 Copenhagen Congress of the Second International.</p><p>Boudin was frequently a candidate for public office on the Socialist Party ticket. He ran for Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1910, 1914 and 1917, and for Chief Judge in 1916. He also ran for Justice of the New York Supreme Court (2nd District) in 1910, 1912, 1919.</p><p>Together with Ludwig Lore and Louis C. Fraina, Boudin was a founding editor of <em>The Class Struggle</em>, a Marxist theoretical magazine which first saw print in May 1917. <em>The Class Struggle</em> published news and commentary about revolutionary socialist events in Europe, including translations of works by some of the leading figures of the Zimmerwald Left, and was an important influence on the formation of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party in 1919 — a group which provided the core of the Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party later in that year. Boudin had left the project by this juncture, however, as a brief notice in the September–October 1918 issue indicated that he had resigned his position as an editor and member of the Socialist Publication Society owing to “differences concerning the policy of the magazine.”</p><p><strong>Life after politics</strong></p><p>After the formation of the Communist Labor Party of America and the Communist Party of America, Boudin shied away from organized politics. He did, however, teach in the Communist Party-sponsored Workers’ School in New York in the late 1920s and occasionally contributed articles to the CP’s artistic magazine, <em>The New Masses</em> during the latter half of the 1930s. Boudin repudiated communism by 1940, although he remained a staunch defender of the civil liberties of Communist Party members.Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Boudin was a frequent contributor of book reviews to scholarly journals such as the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>, <em>The American Journal of Sociology</em>, and <em>The Journal of Politics</em>.</p><p>In addition to working as a lawyer, winning several cases related to the rights of workers to organize trade unions, Boudin also wrote a two volume work called <em>Government by Judiciary</em>, revisiting a topic which he had dealt with in a previous shorter book. In this work, never much read by the radical movement of the day, Boudin argued that the democratic rights of the people had been usurped by the judicial branch of government.

Prime Minister of Sweden, serving for three separate periods in 1920, 1922-1923, and 1924-1925. Awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 1921. </p><p>Born in Stockholm, Branting was the only child of Professor Lars Branting, one of the principal developers of the Swedish school of gymnastics. He was educated at the exclusive Beskow School in Stockholm, passing his matriculation examination at the age of seventeen, with a distinguished record in mathematics and Latin. After studying at the University of Uppsala for the next five years, concentrating on mathematics and astronomy, he accepted a position in 1882 as an assistant to the director of the Stockholm Observatory. </p><p>But Branting was a social scientist as well as a natural scientist. By 1880 he had adopted liberal views, which had their origin in his studies and observations on social and cultural questions. In 1881 when he learned that the Stockholm Workers Institute, which provided lectures and courses of study for workingmen, had been denied financial support by the city, he contributed from his personal funds the amount necessary to keep the Institute open. For Branting the year of 1883 proved decisive. In Paris he heard the lectures of the French Socialist, Paul Lafargue; in Zurich he learned about German socialist doctrine from Eduard Bernstein, who was publishing Der Sozial-Demokrat while in self-imposed exile; wherever he went - including Russia - he tested his thinking in discussion with workingmen and social philosophers.</p><p>Giving up his scientific career in 1884, Branting joined the staff of the radical Stockholm paper <em>Tiden</em> [The Times] as foreign editor. He became editor-in-chief the next year but, like his predecessor in that office, was unable to solve the financial crises which periodically afflicted the paper. Upon its demise in 1886, Branting became chief editor of another socialist newspaper, Socialdemokraten, making this journal, in the course of his thirty-one year\'association with it, a textbook for the education of the workers and a potent force in Swedish politics. Radical though Branting was, he taught evolution rather than revolution, believing that true democracy could not exist without the active involvement of the workingmen and that any socialist philosophy not based on the democratic concept was a mockery.</p><p>Branting formed workingme\' clubs, helped to organize unions, supported strikes, directed strategy. In demand as a speaker at innumerable meetings, he became one of the most skillful speakers in the land, noted for his logical argument, precision of style, blunt honesty, warmth of personality. </p><p>He was the directing genius behind the formation of the Social Democratic Labor Party in 1889, serving as its president from 1907 until his death. To advance the aspirations of the workingman, political action should, he believed, be enmeshed with industrial action, not superimposed upon it.</p><p>Elected to the Lower Chamber of the Parliament in 1896 from a workingme\' constituency in Stockholm, Branting was the sole Social Democrat to hold a seat until 1902. In Parliament he gave visibility to the rights of workers, decried legislation against unions, pled for universal suffrage, supported national defence, and advocated peaceful solution of the crisis between Sweden and Norway over the dissolution of the union in 1905. Meanwhile, the power of his party grew: in 1902 there were four Social Democrats out of a total membership of 230 in the Lower Chamber of the Parliament; in 1903, thirteen; in 1908, thirty-four; in 1911, sixty-four; in 1914, seventy-two; in 1921, a hundred and ten.</p><p>By 1917, the Social Democrats were a strong third party in what had traditionally been a two-party system. In that year the Social Democrats joined the Liberals in a coalition government, with Branting as minister of finance. The coalition sponsored the constitutional reform of 1919, extending the franchise to all males (women receiving the vote in 1921 under Brantin\' government), but it was dissolved when the Liberals refused to support the Social Democrat\'demands for tax reform, unemployment insurance, and nationalization. </p><p>Branting then formed his first government, depending upon Liberal support since he did not command a majority in Parliament. When the power of the Liberal Party appeared to be diminishing, he dissolved the Parliament in October of 1920, but the ensuing elections went against him. He returned to the prime ministry in October, 1921, retaining the foreign affairs portfolio and departed in April, 1923, when faced by a combination of the Liberals and Conservatives. When the elections of 1924 gave the Social Democrats a majority over each of the other two parties, Branting, for the third time, became prime minister, resigning in January, 1925, when his health failed. </p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/branting/index.htm" target="_top">Branting Archive</a>.</p>')

He was expelled from the party in 1946.</p><p><strong>Early years</strong></p><p>Earl Browder was born in Wichita, Kansas on May 20, 1891, the eighth child of an American-born father sympathetic to populism.  He joined the <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america">Socialist Party of America</a> in Wichita in 1907 at the age of 16 and remained in that organization until the party split of 1912, when many of the group’s syndicalistically oriented members exited the organization in response to the addition of an anti-sabotage clause to the party constitution and the recall of National Executive Committeeman William “Big Bill” Haywood. Historian Theodore Draper notes that Browder “was influenced by an offshoot of the syndicalist movement which believed in working in the AF of L (American Federation of Labor).” This ideological orientation brought the young Browder into contact with <a href="../f/o.htm#foster-william">William Z. Foster</a>, founder of an organization called the Syndicalist League of North America which was based upon similar policies and <a href="../c/a.htm#cannon-james">James P.

In 1916 he took a job as manager of the Johnson County Cooperative Association in Olathe, Kansas. </p><p>Browder was aggressively opposed to World War I and publicly spoke out against it, characterizing the fighting as an imperialist conflict. After the United States joined the war in 1917, Browder was arrested and charged under the Espionage Act conspiring to defeat the operation of the draft law and nonregistration. Browder was sentenced to 2 years in prison for conspiracy and 1 year for nonregistration, sitting in jail from December 1917 to November 1918.</p><p>In 1919, Browder, Cannon, and their Kansas City associates started a radical newspaper, <a href="../../../history/usa/pubs/workersworld/index.htm"><em>The Workers World</em></a>, with Browder serving as the first editor. In June of that year Browder was jailed again on a conspiracy charge, however, with Cannon taking over as editor. Browder’s second prison stint, served at Leavenworth Penitentiary, lasted until November of 1920, putting him out of circulation during the critical interval when the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party quit the SPA to form the Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party. A series of splits and mergers followed, with the two Communist parties formally merging in 1921.</p><p>Released from prison at last, Browder lost no time in joining the United Communist Party (UCP), as well as the fledgling Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) being launched by his old associate William Z. Foster. Browder found employment as the managing editor of the monthly magazine of TUEL, The Labor Herald.</p><p>In 1920 the Communist International (Comintern) headed by Gregory Zinoviev decided to establish an international confederation of Communist trade unions, the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU, or “Profintern”). A founding convention was planned to be held in Moscow in July of 1921 and an American delegation was gathered, including members of the American Communist Parties and the Industrial Workers of the World. Earl Browder was named to this delegation, ostensibly representing Kansas miners, with the non-party man Foster attending as a journalist representing the Federated Press.This trip to Soviet Russia incidentally proved decisive in bringing the syndicalist Foster over to the Communist movement.</p><p>Throughout the early 1920s, Browder and Foster worked together closely in the TUEL, trying to win over the support of the Chicago Federation of Labor in the establishment of a new mass Farmer-Labor Party that would be able to challenge the electoral hegemony of the Republican and Democratic parties.</p><p>In 1928, the estranged Browder and his lover Kitty Harris went to China and lived in Shanghai where they worked together on behalf of RILU’s Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, a Comintern organization engaged in clandestine labor organizing. The pair returned to the United States in 1929.</p><p><strong>CPUSA leadership</strong></p><p>Browder became General Secretary of the Communist party in 1930 and took over the top position of party chairman in 1932 after William Z. Foster suffered a heart attack. During his term as General Secretary, Browder embraced the popular front tactic and led the CPUSA’s tactic of expressing support for the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, while demanding that it should go much farther in terms of restructuring the capitalist system. Browder was the party’s candidate for President of the United States in the 1936 presidential election but won only 80,195 votes. During this time, Browder made at least one and possibly two trips to the Soviet Union on a false U.S. passport. After admitting he had traveled on a false passport in a public statement, he was tried and sentenced to prison in 1940 for passport violations. Browder was released after 14 months when the United States joined World War II and became an ally of the Soviet Union.</p><p>In 1944, perceiving the end of the war and the possibility of postwar tension between Washington and Moscow, Browder made moves to distance the CPUSA from the Soviet Union, declaring that communism and capitalism could peacefully co-exist. This policy became known in the Party as Browderism. The CPUSA reconstituted itself as the Communist Political Association.</p><p><strong>Expulsion from the CPUSA</strong></p><p>With the end of the Great Power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, “Browderism” came under attack from the rest of the international Communist movement. In 1945, Jacques Duclos, a leader of the French Communist Party, published an article denouncing Browder’s policy. With the Comintern having been dissolved during the war, the “Duclos letter” was used to informally communicate Moscow’s views. William Z. Foster, Browder’s predecessor and a staunch Marxist-Leninist, led the opposition to Browder within the party and replaced him as party chairman in 1945, with Eugene Dennis taking over as General Secretary. Browder was expelled from the party in 1946.</p><p>Browder continued to campaign for his views outside the Party and criticized the CPUSA’s domination by Moscow, writing that “The American Communists had thrived as champions of domestic reform. But when the Communists abandoned reforms and championed a Soviet Union openly contemptuous of America while predicting its quick collapse, the same party lost all its hard-won influence. It became merely a bad word in the American language.”</p><p>In April 1950, Browder was called to testify before a Senate Committee investigating Communist activity. Questioned by Joseph McCarthy, Browder was willing to criticize the American Communist Party but refused to answer questions that would incriminate former comrades. He falsely testified under oath that he had never been involved in espionage activities. Browder was charged with contempt of Congress, but Judge F. Dickinson Letts ordered his acquittal because he felt the committee had not acted legally. Browder was never prosecuted for his espionage work on behalf of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Browder’s final public appearance was in a debate with Max Shachtman, the dissident Trotskyist, in which the pair debated socialism. Browder defended the Soviet Union while Shachtman acted as a prosecutor. It is reported that at one point in the debate Shachtman listed a series of leaders of various Communist Parties and noted that each had perished at the hands of Stalin; at the end of this speech, he remarked that Browder too had been a leader of a Communist Party and, pointing at him, announced: “There-there but for an accident of geography, stands a corpse!” </p><p>An attempt to reinstate Browder in the CPUSA following the Twentieth Party Congress and the move to destalinization failed. He remained outside of the party until his death in Princeton, New Jersey on June 27, 1973.</p><p class="fst"><a href="../../../archive/browder/index.htm" target="_top">Earl Browder Archive</a></p><p class="inline">[Composed by Tim Davenport]</p>')

Bunting was born in London in 1873, the great grandson of Jabez Bunting, the Wesleyan leader, and the son of Percy Bunting, who was the first editor of the Contemporary Review. His mother did social work among London’s poor. Bunting graduated from Oxford and came to South Africa in 1900 with British forces in the Boer War. He decided to remain and take up legal studies, eventually establishing a law practice in Johannesburg. </p><p>By 1910 he had become sympathetic to the views of the Labour Party, and in March 1914 he was elected to the Transvaal provincial council on its ticket. He subsequently broke with the party on the issue of participation in the war, and together with W.H. Andrews and others he split away to form the anti-war International Socialist League (ISL). By the time the CPSA was formed in 1921, Bunting had broken completely with the labour movement, though he continued to believe that the white workers would eventually see the need to unite on class lines with workers of other races. </p><p>In 1922 Bunting went to Moscow to attend the fourth Congress of the Communist International. On his return he took over a secretary ship of the CPSA from Andrews, and in 1924 he was elected party chairman. The Industrial and Commercial Workers’ Union of Clements Kadalie was then becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Bunting’s belief in the potential for trade unionism among blacks no longer seemed as far-fetched as it once had to some in the ISL. Under his leadership the CPSA turned seriously to the recruitment of Africans. When support from white socialists proved inadequate, Bunting paid party expenses from his own pocket. Through his legal defence of political radicals, he won much African goodwill.</p><p>The 1928 Comintern decision that South African communists were to advocate a “Native Republic” came as a shock to Bunting, who rightly foresaw that the slogan would decimate the party. With Edward Roux, Bunting and his wife Rebecca went to Moscow to the sixth Comintern congress in 1928 to argue against the new doctrine. They were unsuccessful, however, and Bunting found himself castigated as a white chauvinist and right-wing deviationist. He reluctantly accepted the Comintern directive and returned to South Africa to make the most of the new policy. In the 1929 election year, Bunting ran as a Communist candidate in Tembuland in the Transkei, where almost half the electorate was black. Police harassment was intense, and he polled only 289 votes. Following the campaign, Bunting and Roux began an abortive effort to organize the League of African Rights, which they hoped would become a socialist-oriented mass movement for Africans, but Moscow ordered the league dissolved.</p><p>Being an empiricist more than a philosopher, according to his biographer Edwards Roux, Bunting was always vulnerable to the charge that he was deficient in Communist theory. Acknowledging this deficiency, he remained loyal to the Communist cause and to Soviet leadership even when his own judgement put him in conflict with Comintern policy. When Douglas Wolton returned to South Africa to South Africa in 1930 with instructions to eliminate “chauvinists” and “social democrats” from the party leadership, Bunting came under fierce attack and was expelled in September 1931. Drained financially and, for health reasons, unable to carry on with his law practise, his took a job as a viola player in a Johannesburg orchestra.

After being held in prison for two weeks she was finally acquitted from the marathon Treason Trial, along with 91 others in October 1958. </p><p>In 1959 she was banned from attending meetings and ordered to resign from 26 organisations. After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, she was detained for three and half months at Pretoria Central Prison and in 1962 placed under house arrest with her husband Brian. In 1963 Sonia Bunting went into exile and there she continued her work for the Communist Party and held numerous positions in the liberation movement including running the only office of the SACP in the world for twenty years. Sonia was the organiser of the World Campaign for the Release of South African Political Prisoners, which mobilised worldwide support for the Rivonia accused and played a significant part in saving Nelson Mandela and other leaders from the death penalty. In 1991, after the unbanning of the ANC and SACP, Sonia and her husband Brian returned to Cape Town where they continued their political work.

James was raised as a Roman Catholic stock but rejected Catholicism as a college student, professing atheism for much of his life (although returning to the church shortly before his death). He graduated at the top of his class at Princeton University before attending Balliol College, Oxford.</p><p>A member of the A.J. Muste’s American Workers Party in the early 1930s, Burnham supported the 1934 merger with the Communist League of America which formed the U.S. Workers Party. In 1935 he allied with the Trotskyist wing of that party and favored fusion with the Socialist Party of America. However, Burnham’s engagement with Trotskyism was short-lived: from 1937 a number of disagreements came to the fore.</p><p>In 1937 the Trotskyists were expelled from the Socialist Party, an action which led to the formation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) at the end of the year. Inside the SWP, Burnham allied with Max Shachtman in a faction fight over the position of the SWP’s majority faction, led by James P. Cannon and backed by Leon Trotsky, defending the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers state against the incursions of imperialism. Shachtman and Burnham, especially after witnessing the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939 and the invasions of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by the Stalin regime, as well as the Soviet invasion of Finland in November 1939, came to contend that the USSR was a new form of imperialistic class society and was thus not worthy of even critical support from the socialist movement.</p><p>After a protracted discussion inside the SWP, in which the factions argued their case in a series of heated internal discussion bulletins, the special 3rd National Convention of the organization in early April 1940 decided the question in favor of the Cannon majority by a vote of 55-31. Even though the majority sought to avoid a split by offering to continue the debate and to allow proportional representation of the minority on the party’s governing National Committee, Shachtman, Burnham, and their supporters resigned from the SWP to launch their own organization, again called the Workers Party.</p><p>This break also marked the end of Burnham’s participation in the radical movement, however. On May 21, 1940, he addressed a letter to the National Committee of the Workers Party resigning from the organization. In it he made it clear the distance he had moved away from Marxism:</p><p class="indentb">“I reject, as you know, the ‘philosophy of Marxism,’ dialectical materialism...</p><p class="indentb">“The general Marxian theory of ‘universal history,’ to the extent that it has any empirical content, seems to me disproved by modern historical and anthropological investigation.</p><p class="indentb">“Marxian economics seems to me for the most part either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena. Those aspects of Marxian economics which retain validity do not seem to me to justify the theoretical structure of the economics.</p><p class="indentb">“Not only do I believe it meaningless to say that ‘socialism is inevitable’ and false that socialism is ‘the only alternative to capitalism’; I consider that on the basis of the evidence now available to us a new form of exploitive society (which I call ‘managerial society’) is not only possible but is a more probable outcome of the present than socialism. </p><p class="indentb">“On no ideological, theoretic or political ground, then, can I recognize, or do I feel, any bond or allegiance to the Workers Party (or to any other Marxist party). That is simply the case, and I can no longer pretend about it, either to myself or to others.”</p><p>In 1941, Burnham wrote a book analyzing the development of economics and society as he saw it, called <em>The Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World.</em></p><p>During World War II, Burnham went on to work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p><p>After the war, he called for an aggressive strategy to undermine the Soviet Union’s power. During the Cold War, he regularly wrote for the National Review magazine. In 1983, conservative Republican President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Burnham’s ideas were an important influence on both the paleoconservative and neoconservative factions of the American Right Wing.</p><p>Burnham’s seminal work, <em>The Managerial Revolution,</em> attempted to theorize about the future of world capitalism based upon observations of its development in the interwar period. Burnham argued three possible futures for capitalism: (1) that capitalism was a permanent form of social and economic organization and that it would be continued for a protracted period of time; (2) that capitalism was a temporary form of organization destined by its nature to collapse and be replaced by socialism; (3) that capitalism was a temporary form of organization currently being transformed into some non-socialist future form of society. Burnham argued that since capitalism had a more or less definite beginning, which he dated to approximately the 14th Century, it could not be regarded as an immutable and permanent form. Moreover, Burnham observed that in the last years of previous forms of economic organization, such those of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, mass unemployment was “a symptom that a given type of social organization is just about finished.” The worldwide mass unemployment of the depression era was, for Burnham, indicative that capitalism was itself “not going to continue much longer.”</p><p>Dust jacket of the 1941 edition of Burnham’s seminal work.</p><p>Burnham looked around the world for indications of the new form of society which was emerging to replace historic capitalism and saw certain commonalities between the economic formations of Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and America under Franklin D. Roosevelt and his “New Deal.” Burnham argued that over a comparatively short period, which he dated from the first world war, a new society had emerged in which a “social group or class” which Burnham called “managers” had engaged in a “drive for social dominance, for power and privilege, for the position of ruling class.” For at least a decade previous to Burnham’s book, the idea of a “separation of ownership and control” of the modern corporation had been part of American economic thought, with Burnham citing <em>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</em> by Berle and Means as an important exposition. Burnham expanded upon this concept, arguing that whether ownership was corporate and private or statist and governmental, the essential demarcation between the ruling elite (executives and managers on the one hand, bureaucrats and functionaries on the other) and the mass of society was not ownership so much as it was control of the means of production.</p><p>Burnham emphasized that “New Dealism,” as he called it, “is not, let me repeat, a developed, systematized managerial ideology.” Still, this ideology had contributed to American capitalism’s moving in a “managerial direction”:</p><p class="indentb">“In its own more confused, less advanced way, New Dealism too has spread abroad the stress on the state as against the individual, planning as against private enterprise, jobs (even if relief jobs) against opportunities, security against initiative, ‘human rights’ against ‘property rights.’ There can be no doubt that the psychological effect of New Dealism has been what the capitalists say it has been: to undermine public confidence in capitalist ideas and rights and institutions. Its most distinctive features help to prepare the minds of the masses for the acceptance of the managerial social structure.”</p><p>The conservative implications of Burnham’s ideas seem clear.</p><p>In June 1941, a hostile review of <em>The Managerial Revolution</em> by Socialist Workers Party loyalist Joseph Hansen in the SWP’s theoretical magazine accused Burnham of having lifted the central ideas of his book “without acknowledging the source” from the Italian Bruno Rizzi and his 1939 book <em>La Bureaucratisation du Monde</em>. Despite certain similarities, there is no evidence Burnham knew of said book beyond Leon Trotsky’s brief references to it.</p><p>In a later book, <em>The Machiavellians</em>, he argued and developed his theory that the emerging new élite would better serve its own interests if it retained some democratic trappings – political opposition, a free press, and a controlled “circulation of the élites.”</p><p>His 1964 book <em>Suicide of the West</em> became a classic text for the conservatives of the Right Wing movement in U.S. politics, defining liberalism as a “syndrome” rendering liberals ridden with guilt and internal contradictions. The works of James Burnham greatly influenced paleoconservative author Samuel Francis, who wrote two books about Burnham, and based his political theories upon the “managerial revolution” and the resulting managerial state.</p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../history/etol/writers/burnham/index.htm" target="_top">James Burnham Archive</a>.</p>')

After a brief education became an apprentice in the engineering industry. One of his fellow workers, Victor Delahaye, introduced Burns to radical writers such as John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin. </p><p>In 1879 Burns joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and found employment with the United Africa Company. Horrified by the way the Africans were treated, Burns became convinced that only socialism would remove the inequalities between races and classes. He returned to England in 1881 and soon afterwards formed the Battersea branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). One of the first people to join was another young engineer, Tom Mann. </p><p>John Burns was elected to the executive council of the Social Democratic Federation and in the 1885 General Election was their unsuccessful candidate in Nottingham West. The following year he led a demonstration in London against unemployment. The march degenerated into a riot and Burns was arrested and charged with conspiracy and sedition. He was acquitted but in November, 1887, he was arrested with his friend, Robert Cunninghame Graham during the Bloody Sunday demonstration in London. This time he was sentenced to six weeks in prison. </p><p>In June, 1889, John Burns left the Social Democratic Federation after a disagreement with the party’s leader, H. Hyndman. Like his friend, Tom Mann, Burns was now convinced that socialism would be achieved through trade union activity rather than by parliamentary elections.  </p><p>When the London Dock Strike started in August 1889, Ben Tillett asked John Burns to help win the dispute. Burns, a passionate orator, helped to rally the dockers when they were considering the possibility of returning to work. He was also involved in raising money and gaining support from other trade unionists. During the dispute Burns emerged with Ben Tillett and Tom Mann as one of the three main leaders of the strike. </p><p>The employers hoped to starve the dockers back to work but other trade union activists such as Will Thorne, Eleanor Marx, James Keir Hardie and Henry Hyde Champion, gave valuable support to the 10,000 men now out on strike. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Labour Church raised money for the strikers and their families. Trade Unions in Australia sent over £30,000 to help the dockers to continue the struggle. After five weeks the employers accepted defeat and granted all the dockers’ main demands.  </p><p>Burns was now a well-known labour leader and in the elections for the newly created London County Council, he was elected to represent Battersea. At one of the meetings Burns managed to get a motion passed that stated that in future all Council work should only be awarded to those contractors who agreed to observe trade union standards on wages and working conditions.  </p><p>In the 1892 General Election John Burns was elected to represent Battersea in the House of Commons. Burns now joined the other socialist who won a seat in the election, James Keir Hardie. Whereas Burns was willing to work closely with the Liberal Party, Hardie argued for the formation of a new working class political party. Burns attended the meeting in 1900 that established the Labour Representation Committee, the forerunner of the Labour Party, but refused to join and continued to align himself to the Liberal Party.  </p><p>Burns knew that the Liberal Party might win the next election whereas the Labour Party would take a long time before it was in a position to form a government. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 General Election, the new Prime Minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, offered John Burns the post of President of the Local Government Board.  </p><p>Burns, the first member of the working-class to become a government minister, disappointed the labour movement with his period in office. Burns was responsible for only one important piece of legislation, the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909, during his time in government. Burns, who was now earning £5,000 a year, was bitterly attacked in the House of Commons by old comrades such as Fred Jowett, when he argued for no outdoor relief to be given to the poor. Burns was reminded how he had been a strong critic of the Poor Law and the workhouse system when he had been a member of the Social Democratic Federation.  </p><p>Supporters of Burns point out that he did have his successes. For example, he piloted through the House of Commons the 1910 Census Bill that sought to obtain more information about both family structure and urban conditions in order for the government to develop policies to tackle problems such as infant mortality and slum housing. By 1913 his administrative reforms had resulted in a more effective deployment of medical staff in the infirmaries.  </p><p>Burns gradually began to question the growth in the Welfare State. He told a conference in August 1913, that the government and charity organisations should not “supersede the mother, and they should not by over-attention sterilise her initiative and capacity to do what every mother should be able to do for herself.” </p><p>In 1914 Burns was appointed as President of the Board of Trade. However, soon afterwards, the British government decided to declare war on Germany. Burns was opposed to Britain becoming involved in a European conflict and along with John Morley and Charles Trevelyan, resigned from the government.  </p><p>Burns, without the support of the Liberal Party or the Labour Party, and aware that the public felt hostile to those politicians who did not fully support Britain’s involvement in the First World War, decided not to stand in the 1918 General Election.  </p><p>Burns played no further role in politics after 1918. The following year Andrew Carnegie left Burns an annuity of £1,000. Burns spent the rest of his life on his hobbies: the history of London, book collecting and cricket.

Cantor wrote little of a philosophical nature, but his startling achievements in fundamental investigations of mathematics stimulated the deeper enquiry into the epistemological foundations of mathematics which had a profound influence on Western thought during the first three decades of the twentieth century.</p><p>Of prosperous and cultured Danish-born parents, Cantor’s talent for mathematics was observed  when he was only 14 and by the age of 18 he was studying under the great mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker, and by 1867 had published a doctoral thesis on one of Gauss’s famous unsolved problems. Cantor then joined the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life.</p><p>In a series of papers published from 1869 to 1873, Cantor dealt with the theory of numbers, trigonometric series - in which he extended the concept of real numbers, Riemann’s complex numbers, and a new definition of irrational numbers in terms of convergent sequences of rational numbers. Following an exchange of letters with Dedekind, he then began the work for which he is famous: Set Theory and the concept of transfinite numbers.</p><p>In 1873, Cantor used the idea of one-to-one correspondence to show that the rational numbers (i.e. fractions), though infinite in number, are <em>countable</em> because they may be arranged in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural (whole) numbers, but, contrariwise, the set of real numbers (i.e. including numbers with infinitely many decimal digits) was <em>uncountable</em>. Even more paradoxically, he proved that the set of all algebraic numbers (such as the square root of 2 and so on) are as numerous as the natural numbers, but transcendental numbers (such as pi), which are a <em>subset</em> of the real numbers, are <em>uncountable</em> and therefore more numerous than the natural numbers!</p><p>The results were so startling that at first Kronecker refused to publish it.</p><p>Cantor’s theory quickly became controversial, leading to the study of a whole sequence of “transfinite numbers” each larger than the one before. Cantor held that these transfinite numbers had an <em>actual existence</em>, drawing on his early religious training to justify the assertion.

However,in later life, the positions he took on political and economic affairs seemedmore in line with the Tories.</p><p>Carlyle is renowned for his passionate, preacher-like opposition toindustrial society that was emerging in Britain, captured in his <i>Chartism</i>(1840) and, especially, <i>Past and Present</i> (1843), a book much admired by Engels. Carlyle was not an economist or even a scholar, but more like an Old Testament prophet. His utter disdain for economists and economics is well known – it was he who characterized it as “the dismal science.” In his view, it was the economists and their theories whichserved as the apologistic ideological and religious buttress of the industrialrevolution that, in his view, was destroying Britain. At one point, herecommended that economists ought to be “popularly elected” as a wayto make them accountable to the population that their theories were helpingruin. Nonetheless, he was, at least for a time, a friend of John Stuart Mill.He was also a close friend of John Ruskin.</p><p>Thomas Carlyle was a “feudalist” (if such a term can be allowed).But he does not pine for old-fashioned reactionary aristocracy or pastoralromance. Rather, Carlyle absorbed Goethe’s ideas on the “natural,” in particular the relationship between external order andpersonal freedom. He conceived that the end of human activity is activity itself– the Protestant ethic, secularly enhanced.</p><p>For Carlyle, the feudal system’s <i>sole</i> value is that it is much better atassigning a man an activity and thereafter granting him the freedom to pursue it in any manner he pleases. In contrast, a market system assignshim no activity, but simultaneously becomes the hardest taskmaster of all by forcing him to “serve it” by chasing wage labor, profit, etc. Hesees a market society as “unnatural” as it forces people to pursueconsumption and accumulation, whereas, in Carlyle’s view, people’s nature is to pursue activity.</p><p>Thus, for Carlyle, the feudal system may be harsh in limiting social mobility, but it offers freedom of activity at the individual level and the joy of craftsmanship.In contrast, the market system is socially much more progressive, but at the individual level, it forces everybody into the unnatural activities of gain and acquisition.</p><p>Carlyle’s darkest moment was the publication of his infamous defense of slavery(in his 1849 <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>) and his shamelessly racist and venomous <i>Latter-Day Pamphlets</i> (1850). </p><p>Carlyle saw little difference between a black slave in a slave society and a joyous yeoman in a feudal society– except that one is loyally bound to his task bychains and whips, and the other by tradition and custom. In either case, the “joy of work” is (eventually) achieved.</p><p>It was his attacks on the Evangelical Christian abolitionismand charity which were the main sore point with Victorian society.</p><p>But neither a feudal society nor a slave society are being “recommended” by Carlyle. His early interest in Saint-Simonism, which embraced industrial society (but tried to rationalize it) proves that he was not a traditional feudalist. The main issue was the “man-must-work” principle of Saint-Simon and Goethe. How this can be achieved in an industrial society, he did not know nor did he have practical policy suggestions for.

Cervetto was born in Buenos Aires on April 16th, 1927, son of Italian immigrants. </p><p>As a young worker at the llva factory of Savona, after the political-military crisis of Fascism of September 8th, 1943, Cervetto joined the civil war against nazi-fascism, deserving the “Croce al Merito”.</p><p>For five years, since this partisan experience, through  his rejection of Stalinism and  of Togliatti’s ‘svolta di Salerno’ (“Salerno turn”), through the struggle against “anarchist nothingness”, Cervetto studied Marxism thoroughly. </p><p>In March, 1950, Cervetto took part in the first congress, organised in Genoa-Pontedecimo by an anarchist group with the purpose of reorganising FAI (Italian Anarchical Federation). FAI was not a purely “anarchic organisation”, actually it gathered different anti-Stalinist wings, and the Leninist wing (to which Cervetto belonged) as well. </p><p>A long season of political and theoretical struggle was at this point beginning for Cervetto. At first it was carried out by his contribution to newspapers such as <em>Il Libertario</em> (The Libertarian) of Milan—where, from May 1950 to May 1951,  21 articles of Cervetto appeared, dealing with the subjects of the ‘cold war’ and the ‘decolonisation’, later collected in the book “L’imperialismo unitario”—(Unitary Imperialism) and <em>\'mpulso</em> (The Impulse) (1950-57).</p><p>Cervetto’s political and trade union activity was never separated from his effort to develop a core of revolutionary workers united by the principle of theoretical homogeneity as ‘necessary precondition for the building of the workers party in Italy’. </p><p>An intense reorganizational activity took place in 1950 and 1951, in which Cervetto’s major contribution was related to the theoretical struggle. FAI’s nihilist drift brought about the foundation, at the National Convention of Genoa-Pontedecimo held on February 28 and 29, 1951, of GAAP (Anarchic Groups of Proletarian Action). </p><p>Despite the purpose to reach the utmost homogeneity on principles and organization, the new group was shared by two different theoretical conceptions and two different traditions, bound to split: the Marxist-Leninist one—represented by Arrigo Cervetto—, and the Anarchical one,  represented by Pier Carlo Masini.</p><p>Here’s a passage from his contribution to the Thesis approved by the meeting: </p><p class="quoteb">“There aren’t two kinds of imperialism, different in degree and nature, for the working class to choose. Imperialism does exist as a unitary manifestation of a society divided into classes and States: one single block, though shaken and agitated by tearing inner contradictions. Therefore, the only choice the world proletariat is faced with is whether to side with imperialism or with anti-imperialism”. </p><p>The indivisible imperialism became the central theme of Cervetto’s analysis; suffice it to cite some of his articles’ titles: “Imperialism is indivisible, USSR is conditioned by the USA”, “The indivisible imperialism, true aggressor in Korea”, and so on. </p><p>In this analysis, the indivisibility of imperialism reflects itself in the inner contradictions of the two major imperialist powers, assuming the form of peripheral crises. </p><p>At the third GAAP conference, in September 1953, Cervetto blamed, nonetheless, the tendency of some revolutionary groups to ‘consider imperialism as an immense machine, a great compressor’, which wouldn’t leave any space for revolutionary action. </p><p>This view was linked with trade-union tactics. Cervetto criticized those groups of the Communist Left, heirs of Bordighism, which understood the counter-revolutionary phase as barring any union action. Since they considered trade unions as completely integrated and controlled by the “two blocks”, they ended up  rejecting any commitment of militants inside them. On the contrary, Cervetto considered intervention inside trade unions as a permanent duty of the party, even though he was fully aware that it is dependent on the capitalist cycle. </p><p>Cervetto contributed  to the new series of the journal <em>Prometeo,</em> (1954, 1959 e 1960), and to <em>Azione Comunista</em> (1957-64), a paper born from a maximalist-wing of the PCI. Because of this origin of <em>Azione Comunista,</em> Cervetto paid attention not to make any concessions to maximalism and to attitudes of mere and unscientific dissention. </p><p>During “[our] co-operation with the newspaper [<em>Azione Comunista</em>]” Lorenzo Parodi, co-founder of Lotta Comunista, recalls “it was clear that there were two different lines: the agitational one, expressed by PCI dissidents and by those who had remained caught in the social-democratization, and the Leninist one […] When the pragmatism without principles of the former caused a crisis of the paper, our group assumed the responsibility of transferring its publication to Genoa,  in order to give it an homogeneous line, thus anticipating the function of collective organizer of the Leninist groups which, later on, would be assumed by ‘Lotta Comunista’”.</p><p>This way he arrived at the formulation of the <em>Theses of 1957</em> upon the imperialistic development, the length of the counter-revolutionary phase and the problem of building a working-class party: it was necessary, in his view, to detach the “Communist Left” from the social-imperialistic tide accelerated by the de-Stalinization. </p><p>With these <em>Theses</em> Cervetto fought against the social-democratic turn of the former working-class parties. In November, 1957, he said: “[…] The bureaucratization of such parties [PCI and PSI] is not a degeneration of the workers’ movement, it is definitely a necessity for the capitalist-system, which is trying to establish, through its political agents, its hegemony upon the workers’ movement itself. It is absurd to think of competing with this particular form of organization of the capitalist hegemony”. Hence the necessity to build a revolutionary party; a process which will bring to the founding of “Lotta Comunista”. </p><p>The revolutionary party is expressed by the objective conditions: «It cannot be the fruit of pure theoretical and political will». Without these objective conditions, which develop when the proletarian masses are pressed, by a situation of deep economic crisis, to express a revolutionary movement from below, «the struggle of the revolutionary party against the reformist super-structure is very limited and can obtain only quite partial results». </p><p>In such a counter-revolutionary situation, the struggle is «forcibly reduced to the recovery and formation of cadres». </p><p class="quoteb">“The party—Cervetto writes—develops itself with a daily work of organization and education of the proletariat, it can’t rely upon the waves of spontaneity”. </p><p>Here was starting for Cervetto a second season of theoretical study. The themes he deals with are those of Lenin’s strategy on the role of the October Revolution as accelerator of the capitalistic development in Asia, the fight against the influence of Maoist ideology in Italy, the future role of China in inter-imperialistic struggles, Comintern’s policy on the “national and colonial” question. Some titles on these subjects are: “Lenin and the Chinese revolution” (a series of articles appeared in <em>Azione Comunista</em> in 1962 and later, in 1966, published as a pamphlet by Lotta Comunista); “The Indonesian counter-revolution”, (printed in form of articles in “Lotta Comunista” in 1966 and later published as pamphlet by Edizioni Lotta Comunista, Roma, in 1969); “The Maoist theory of the United Front” written in 1969 and published as a pamphlet in 1972.</p><p>Meanwhile he studied Lenin’s conception on political action as a scientific basis for the solution of the «problems left unresolved by Bordiga’s objectivism and by Trotsky’s subjectivism», resumed in his book “Class Struggles and the Revolutionary Party”, Edizioni Lotta Comunista, Roma, 1966 (first published in a series of articles in <em>Azione Comunista</em>, 1964). Cervetto knew Bordiga and adopted his formulation of “State Capitalism” related to Soviet Russia. But he criticized the position, taken by Bordiga after WWII, about a kind of American “super-imperialism”. “It’s evident in Bordiga’s thought”, he writes in “La difficile questione dei tempi” [‘The Difficult Question of Times”] “an abnormal over-evaluation of the strength of the United States, of the weakness of Europe and of the destruction of world fix capital [made during the war]”, it looks as though there were “a new form of domination, which temporarily annuls the acuteness of inter-imperialistic conflicts”. Because of this position”, so goes Cervetto’s criticism “Bordiga has retired in a sort of <em>attendismo</em>” (a position of inaction), limiting political action to “defending the program” and thus involuntarily obstructing the formation of an active revolutionary party in Italy. </p><p>With regards to the times and duration of the counter-revolutionary period, Cervetto recalled the Asian question, the industrialization of India and China, that is, the time necessary for these countries to reach an “intermediate” level of development, leading to capital exports and their imperialistic maturation. </p><p>The consolidation and development of the Leninist party in Italy, allowed Cervetto to begin the long and systematical ordering of his 50 years theoretical activity, in order to issue an organic edition of the main subjects of his analysis. </p><p><em>L’imperialismo unitario</em> (Unitary Imperialism), which covers the analysis of thirty years of imperialistic development, from the 1950s to 1980, published in 1981.</p><p><em>Il ciclo politico del capitalismo di Stato, 1950-1967</em> (The Political Cycle of State Capitalism, 1950-1967), Milan, 1989: Stalinism is considered as the supporter of this particular form of capitalistic exploitation. </p><p><em>La contesa mondiale</em> (The Global Competition), Milan, 1990, in which the imperialistic struggles of the 1980s are understood as “a first conclusion of a war of capitals lasted fifty years”: on the Eastern front, Russia has lost while Germany has won, while on the Western front the final result is still open. </p><p><em>La difficile questione dei tempi</em> (The Difficult Question of Times), Milan, 1990, in which Cervetto intervenes in the debate upon the times of revolution between Stalin, Trotsky and Bordiga: while it is possible to scientifically recognize the general tendency of capitalism and to foresee its inevitable outcomes, it is impossible to foresee the times of its maturity, also determined by the very presence of an active factor such as the revolutionary party.  </p><p><em>\'neguale sviluppo politico, 1968-1979</em> (The Uneven Political Development, 1968-1979), Milan, 1991: an analysis of the development of Italian capitalism during the 1970s and of the deep unbalance between the movements of economy and of the political over-structure. </p><p>Finally, his studies in the materialistic conception of politics, started in the middle 70s, are published in <em>\'nvolucro politico</em> (The Political Shell), 1994. </p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../c.htm">Index of the Letter C</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

Chomsky is a Kantian in philosophy, being a defender of the idea of innate cognitive faculties.</p><p>Chomsk\' interest in linguistics dates from his childhood and he went on to study linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, publishing his doctoral thesis under the title, <span class="book">Transformational Analysis</span>, and by 1966 he was professor of foreign languages and linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Like <a href="../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/index.htm" target="_top">Kant</a>, Chomsky held that experience and socialisation could not provide the fundamental rational faculty required for the interpretation of experience. At the time, in the mid-1950s, this position was against the stream, with the rising structuralist schools (see <a href="../j/a.htm#jakobson-roman">Roman Jakobson</a> and <a href="../l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude">Claude LéviStrauss</a>) regarding all social and linguistic forms as entirely <em>arbitrary</em>, and acquired by individuals from their socialisation within a given social structure.</p><p>Conversely, Chomsky hypothesised that human beings had an innate facility for comprehending very fundamental syntactic structures, which related to the actual syntax of any given language in much the same way that fundamental mathematical forms like topology and algebra relate to the more concrete forms in common use, such as arithmetic. Young children it is then supposed, are able to draw on an innate facility in these fundamental structures to infer the meaning and syntax of the language they hear around them. This also solves the problem that children are able to formulate grammatical rules and compose sentences that they have never heard before, and in fact are known to be able to construct sentences which adhere to grammatical forms never used by adults, but repeatedly used by young children.</p><p>The key concept in Chomsky’s linguistics is then the way in which increasingly concrete forms of grammar (“surface structures”) can be generated from the supposed innate structures (“generative grammars”). Conversely, analysis of language sought to disclose the underlying “deep structures”. The formal mathematical  rules by which one grammar is generated out of another Chomsky called “transformational rules.”, which he held to be basically the same in all languages, corresponding to innate, genetically transmitted mental structures in human beings.</p><p>Chomsk\' claim for innate knowledge of language has never been widely accepted, but the mathematical methods he introduced for the study of linguistic structure truly changed the landscape in linguistics. The marriage of Chomsky’s structural concepts developed to cope with the infinite complexity of human language, with <a href="../t/u.htm#turing-alan">Turing’s</a> algorithmic approach to the analysis of logic and computational machines, has proved fruitful in the development of the most mathematical aspects of complexity theory.</p><p>Chomsky also became well known for his opposition to the United State\'involvement in the Vietnam War during the late 1960s and early '70s. In a protracted campaign against the way the War was presented on the mass media he demonstrated how the very structure of these media militated against the expression of dissenting views.

Comte rejected Roman Catholicism and royalism alike at an early age. He was intellectually precocious and in 1814 entered the prestigious École Polytechnique and soon took up permanent residence in Paris, earning a precarious living there by the occasional teaching of mathematics and by journalism. He read widely in philosophy and history and was especially interested in those thinkers who were beginning to discern and trace some order in the history of human society. Montesquieu, Condorcet, Turgot, and Joseph de Maistre were critically worked into his own system of thought.</p><p>Comte’s most important acquaintance in Paris was <a href="../../people/s/a.htm#st-simon-claude">Henri de Saint-Simon</a>, one of the founders of socialism and one of the first to see the importance of economic organisation in modern society. Comte’s ideas were very similar to Saint-Simon’s, and some of his earliest articles appeared in Saint-Simon’s publications. There were distinct differences in the two men’s viewpoints and scientific backgrounds, however, and Comte eventually broke with Saint-Simon. In 1826 Comte began a series of lectures on his "system of positive philosophy" for a private audience, but he soon suffered a serious nervous breakdown. He made an almost complete recovery from his symptoms the following year, and in 1828/29 he again took up his projected lecture series. This was so successfully concluded that he re-delivered it at the Royal Athenaeum. The following 12 years were devoted to his publication of his philosophy in <span class="book">Course of Positive Philosophy</span> (1830-42).</p> <p>During the remainder of his life he was supported in part by English admirers such as <a href="../../people/m/i.htm#mill-john-stuart">John Stuart Mill</a> and disciples such as lexicographer Maximilien Littré. Comte married Caroline Massin in 1825, but the marriage was unhappy and they separated in 1842. In 1845 Comte had a profound romantic and emotional experience with Clotilde de Vaux, who died the following year of tuberculosis. Comte idealised this sentimental episode, which exerted a considerable influence on his later thought and writings, particularly with regard to the role of women in the positivist society he planned to establish.</p><p>Comte devoted the years after the death of Clotilde de Vaux to composing his other major work, the <span class="book">System of Positive Polity</span> (1851-54), in which he completed his formulation of sociology. The entire work emphasised morality and moral progress as the central preoccupation of human knowledge and effort and gave an account of the polity, or political organisation, that this required. Comte lived to see his writings widely scrutinised throughout Europe. Many English intellectuals were influenced by him, and they translated and promulgated his work. His French devotees had also increased, and a large correspondence developed with positivist societies throughout the world. Comte died of cancer in 1857.</p><p>Comte was a rather sombre, ungrateful, self-centred, and egocentric personality, but his intellectual determination and humanitarian zeal attracted many followers.</p><p>Comte lived through the aftermath of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. Modern science and technology and the Industrial Revolution had begun transforming the societies of Europe in directions no one yet understood. Comte’s particular ability was as a synthesiser of the most diverse intellectual currents. From <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hume.htm" target="_top">David Hume</a> and <a href="../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/index.htm" target="_top">Immanuel Kant</a> he derived his conception of positivism, that positive knowledge is based on natural phenomena and their properties and relations as verified by the empirical sciences. From various French clericalist thinkers Comte took the notion of social organisation that would imitate the hierarchy and discipline of the Catholic church. From various Enlightenment philosophers he adopted the notion of historical progress. From Saint-Simon he drew the need for a basic and unifying "sociology" to explain existing social organisations and guide social planning for a better future.</p><p>Comte’s "law of the three stages" maintained that human intellectual development had moved historically from a theological stage, a transitional metaphysical stage, in which explanations were in terms of essences, final causes, and other abstractions; and finally to the modern positive stage, distinguished by an awareness of the limitations of human knowledge. Knowledge, he held, could only be relative to man’s nature as a species and to his social and historical situation. Absolute explanations were therefore better abandoned for the more sensible discovery of laws based on the observable relations between phenomena.</p><p>Comte classified the sciences according to an historical sequence from mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry to biology and finally to sociology. According to Comte, sociology would reduce social facts to laws and synthesise the whole of human knowledge.</p><p>He held that the underlying principles of society are individual egoism, encouraged by the division of labour, and the combination of efforts and the maintenance of social cohesion by means of government and the state.</p><p>Comte rejected democracy, emphasising hierarchy and obedience, and he held that the ideal government would be made up of an intellectual elite.

He resigned in protest in 1776 over Turgot’s dismissal, but went on to serve until 1791. During this time, Condorcet wrote his famous theorem proving that majority voting could not produce consistent results in deciding between more than two alternatives.</p><p>Condorcet took a leading role in the 1789 French Revolution, which he saw as embodying a great hope for his “rationalist” reconstruction of society.  However, he voted against the execution of the Louis XVI and opposed the arrest of the Girodins.  As a result, Condorcet was denounced as a traitor by the Jacobins and went into hiding in 1791.  It was during this period that he wrote his great humanitarian tract on the Progress of the Human Spirit (1795).   Finally captured in 1794, he reportedly took his own life in prison, although the possibility that he was murdered cannot be ruled out.</p>')

The Church condemned Copernicus’s work and progressive thinkers of the time took them up and further developed them. Copernicus thus marks the beginning of materialism in this era. The leap made by Copernicus arose out of the accumulation of astronomical observations which required continual amendment of the Ptolemic model, introducing ever more "spheres" to account for observed trajectories.

He was President of the Operative Bakers’ Association, a Conservative Party member and a Presbyterian. Helen had two sisters and three brothers. Her parents moved to Ipswich, in Suffolk, England during her childhood.</p><p>In the Docklands, she began to listen to the Socialist propagandists at open-air meetings, was impressed by their arguments, and soon entered the suffragette movement, feeling “that if the Mothers of the race had some say, then things would be changed.” Thus began a lifetime of devoted service to the working class movement. From around 1900, she joined the WSPU and became an outstanding fighter for the right of British women to vote. She was sent to prison three times for her activities in the suffragette movement, and spent a month in Holloway Prison in 1912 for breaking windows and was imprisoned for one month for making inflammatory comments in Perth but released after a five day hunger strike). She was also conditionally released from prison in Glasgow’s Duke Street Prison from a one month sentence for smashing windows of the army recruiting offices, only after an eight-day hunger strike. After her release a bomb exploded at Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens and Helen was implicated and was sent back to prison, only to be released after another hunger strike.</p><p>She took a fearless stand in opposition to the Imperialist War of 1914-18. In June 1916, she initiated, and became Secretary of the Women’s Peace Crusade. Also involved were her good friends Mary Barbour and Agnes Dollan. She was twice arrested for her anti-war work, appearing in the dock with William Gallacher and other Socialist leaders.

This delegation chose Helen Crawfurd Anderson to make the report to the Conference on their behalf. </p><p>During the 1914-18 war she had joined the Independent Labour Party, and became Vice-President of that organisation in 1918, and one of its principal propagandists, travelling throughout Scotland and many other parts of Britain to address meetings. She became disillusioned with the ILP and in 1920 established an unofficial grouping within the ILP, known as ‘Left Wing Committee’, with a journal the <em>International</em>. This grouping, which included Emile Burns, R. Palme Dutt, E. H. Brown, Shapurji Saklatvala, J. R. Wilson and J. Walton Newbold, joined the Communist Party.</p><p>She had welcomed the victory of the Russian Revolution in 1917, and visited Russia in 1920, as an ILP delegate to the second congress of the Third International. There she had an interview with Lenin, which was to help chart the future course of her participation in the movement. To the end of her life she was filled with unbounded admiration for the Bolsheviks.  </p><p>On her return from Russia in 1920 she became Secretary (in 1921) of the Workers International Relief Organisation (WIR). She raised money for the famine-stricken people of the Volga region and carried out relief work in Germany, addressing a meeting of 10,000 in Berlin in 1924 on behalf of the German Communist Party (KPD) and in all the mining districts of Britain during the lockout, which followed the General Strike of 1926. She succeeded in extending the relief work to the famine-stricken West of Ireland and to the Scottish Highlands during periods of depression. </p><p>In 1921 she joined the newly-formed Communist Party, becoming a central committee member, setting up the Women’s Department of the Communist Party in January 1922 and editing the women’s page of <em>Communist</em>, the Party’s journal.

At the first news of the approach of enemy forces Danton undertook the or-ganization and leadership of the defence of revolutionary France. In 1793 on Danton’s initiative the revolutionary tribunal was created which launched the Reign of Terror. In December 1793, considering the conquests of the revolution to be sufficiently re-inforced, Danton began to speak out for the need to terminate the Reign of Terror. ‘I propose,’ he said, ‘not to trust whoever might wish to lead the people beyond the bounds of the revolution and to propose ultra.revolutionary measures’. From then on Danton came out openly and firmly against the supporters of the Terror, the representatives of the most democratic layers, Chaumette and Hèbert, and helped Robespierre punish them. But he himself aroused the suspicions of Robespierre who found the line of the the Dantonists not revolutionary enough. Under the pressure of Robespierre, Danton and his supporters were arrested on March 31, 1974 and accused of dealings with the Girondists and of embezzling state funds and so on. The trial ended with the passing of the death sentence and on April 5, 1794 Danton and his closest sympathizers were guillotined.</p>')

Both conceptions are justified within certain limits, but the one is as one-sided and narrowminded as the other.  The interaction of bodies in nature – inanimate as well as animate – includes both harmony and collision, struggle and cooperation.

And that was how debate over “scientific” questions was conducted in those days: one scripture was compared or contrasted with another, but never (apart from within the privileged confines of mathematics) was Reason or observation accepted as evidence. </p><p>It was with very good reason that Descartes held that there was nothing of the body of knowledge of the society of his day that he could affirm with <em>any</em> degree of confidence. “Knowledge” was dominated by myth, prejudice, doctrine, double-talk and above all Religion, backed by the threat of execution and torture. </p><p>It is therefore commonly suspected that Descarte\' supposed proof of the existence of God could be seen as a transparent ploy to avoid declaration as a heretic. Likewise, his moral maxim of “adhering constantly to the religion in which Go\' grace I had been instructed since my childhood, ... etc.". </p><p>On the other hand, it worth noting that Descartes did not just “philosophise” about the capacity of the mind to accurately reflect the properties of space, time and matter: his discovery, Cartesian Geometry, is fundamental to every branch of science to this very day, establishing a correspondence between algebraic formulae and spatial forms which must astound every person who is newly introduced to its marvel. </p><p>Descartes also investigated optics (his vortex notion of light particles in some ways prefigured the modern wave-particle theory), physiology (reflex actions) and cosmology (formation of the heavenly bodies from vortices of matter). </p><p>Francis Bacon and Galileo were Descarte\'predecessors in the search for scientific truth. Both were advocates of experimentation and observation of Nature and both advised that mechanics offered the best first step in building up a knowledge of Nature, Galileo making epoch-making discoveries in this domain. But Descartes craved after certainty, and that was, it appeared, nowhere to be found, only guesswork, speculation, approximate truth, possibility and sheer outright and obvious untruth. </p><p>Like most of the thinkers of the epoch, Descartes aspired to the kind of precision and certainty that Mathematics alone had achieved. While the simplest forms of geometrical measure and mechanical movement appeared amenable to mathematical precision, the whole rich Universe of natural, social and spiritual phenomena was totally out of reach of such analysis. Apart from the opinions of tradespeople, theoretical explanation of Nature was dominated mostly by superstition and baseless dogma. </p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> (Related material:) Ilyenko\' <a href="../../../archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essay1.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Essays from the History of Dialectics</span></a>.</p>')

In his study of interpersonal experience, its realisation in creative expression, the reflective understanding of this experience, and the “logical development” that may be attributed to the development of knowledge and culture in social and historical processes, Dilthey developed important insights. He developed his “descriptive psychology,” mainly through the study of literature, and said of the psychology of his times: “Contemporary psychology is an expanded doctrine of sensation and association. The fundamental power of mental life falls outside the scope of psychology. Psychology has become only a doctrine of the forms of psychic processes, thus it grasps only a part of that which we actually experience as mental life.” Psychology needed to be based on an analysis of mental processes in real-life situations, rather than in a laboratory. Dilthey emphasised that the essence of human beings <em>cannot</em> be grasped by <em>introspection</em> but only from a knowledge of history; knowledge could never be final, because history is never final. Dilthey thus suggested, for the first time, a Cultural Psychology,</p><p>Dilthey held that the <em>historical</em> relativity of all ideas and institutions is the most characteristic and challenging fact in the intellectual life of the modern world. He was hostile to the construction of closed, rational systems and preferred to leave questions unsettled. This preference for leaving questions open, was perhaps the main contributing factor to his failure to be recognised in his own time. Only after the War, did the significance of the methodology of his historical philosophy of life come to be appreciated. Dilthey supervised Mead’s PhD studies.</p>')

Dobb was recognized as the most relevant Marxist economist in western academia.</p><p>Author of many books, papers and pamphlets, he developed both an educational role at Cambridge, where he taught almost uninterruptedly for more than 4 decades, until his retirement at the end of the academic year in 1967, and in the communist party press and educational organizations like the Labour Research Department. He published a large number of popular pamphlets on Marxism, the U.S.S.R, the economics of socialism and on capitalism development and crisis.</p><p>In 1919, at the same moment he began his academic career, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and stayed as a loyal militant until his death. </p><p>His book <em>Studies in the Development of Capitalism (1946</em>) remains a masterpiece in the Marxist historical tradition, and in fact it was the main contribution to the political economy perspective in the generation of studies of the new British Marxist historiography developed mainly by the communist historians of the Historians’ Group (E. Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson, Raphael Samuel among others).</p><p>Deeply convinced that Marxist economics was the logical successor to classical political economy, he tried to develop and apply Marxist economics to problems that conventional economics was unable to analyze correctly, such as imperialism or socialism. </p><p>He joined as an assistant to Piero Sraffa in the project to publish the complete works of David Ricardo. Dobb thought that the publication in 1960 of Piero Sraffa’s book <em>The Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em> made a severe  contribution to the critique of neoclassical economics, and represented a rehabilitation of classical economics and with it, of  the Marxian theory of value.  For Dobb, “neo-Ricardianism” appeared as an academic ally of great importance in defending the academic weight of the Marxist economy. His latest book <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em> (1973) is an important inquiry into this perspective.</p><p>As Ronald Meek said in his obituary for the Proceedings of the British Academy:</p><p class="indentb">“Looking at Dobb’s life and work as a whole, one is struck in particular by two things. The first is that although he was from the beginning a convinced Marxist, he always firmly resisted, in all its manifestations, the vulgar notion that Marx’s ideas constituted a kind of self-contained, encapsulated system which had had no history and was incapable of further development. On the contrary, he always insisted that there was an important sense in which Marx as an economist had worked within a broad analytical tradition established much earlier by Smith and Ricardo (a fact which suggested a ready way of introducing Marx to British audiences); that Marxian economics could and should be developed, and even where necessary transcended; and that this should be done not only with the aid of tools fashioned by Marxists, but also with the aid of at least some of those fashioned by “bourgeois” economists. ()</p><p class="indentb">The second thing which strikes one about Dobb’s life and work -and it is something which I think he himself would have liked to see emphasized-is the way in which throughout his whole life his political and academic activities were so closely linked together, with no loss of integrity and very little sense of strain. He always considered it part of his everyday duty, as a politically conscious academic, to make the results of his research available not only to the <em>cognoscenti</em> but also to interested lay people. And his popular books and pamphlets, whatever their level of discourse, are marked by the same meticulous scholarship, precision of argument, and refusal to make concessions to dogmatism, as his major “academic” works. The other dimension of this which should be noted is that the level of objectivity which Dobb managed to achieve in all his work was very high-quite remarkably high, in fact, if one remembers the political circumstances in which he found himself.”</p><p class="indentb">(Ronald L.

But further, he found the unhistorical consciousness of the exponents of the second positivism of his time like <a href="../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst">Ernst Mach</a> quite unsuited to the solution of the problems of sociology.

The bloody repression that followed the Commune was taken as further evidence of the ruthlessness of capitalism and of the selfishness of the bourgeoisie. The subsequent resurgence of nationalism and anti-Semitism convinced Durkheim that progress was not, as most Positivists of the time had assumed, the necessary consequence of the development of science and technology, but on the contrary, the growth of technology and mechanisation undermined societ\' ethical structures. Durkheim took an active role in the campaign to exonerate Dreyfus, who had been falsely jailed in a spate of anti-semitism, a step which brought considerable criticism down upon him.</p><p>Durkheim made a study of suicide, and observed that an individual who was closely integrated with his culture, was less likely to suicide, and consequently, what appeared to be the most individual of actions, could only be explained through social forces.</p><p>More and more, Durkheim focussed on education and religion as the two most important institutions required for stability while society underwent such deep transformations.

By this stage, he had retired from party leadership roles but remained a member until his death in 1974. </p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/">Graham Stevenson</a></p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../archive/dutt/index.htm" target="_top"><strong>R.

He has published more than fifty books, including <em>Criticism and Ideology: A Study in Marxist Literary Theory</em> (1976), <em>Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism</em> (1981), <em>The Function of Criticism: From the Spectator to Post-Structuralism </em>(1984), and <em>Ideology: An Introduction</em> (1991).', 'undefined', '<p>Eagleton was born on February 22, 1943 to an Irish Catholic family in the City of Salford, UK.  “My childhood was very influenced by Irish culture,” he recalls. “My mother’s family [was] strongly Republican. I remember writing a bad Republican song at seven but I hadn’t a cat’s idea in hell what I was writing about!” (“Taking on the Capitalists” 2007).  He was educated at De La Salle College, a grammar school for boys in Salford. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he eventually went on to obtain both his M.A. and his Ph.D. at the age of 21. While completing his graduate work, Eagleton studied under the tutelage of noted Marxist theorist, Raymond Williams.  Eagleton went on to become a Fellow in English at Jesus College, Cambridge.  Since 1969, he has served as Fellow and Tutor at Wadham College, Oxford.  Eagleton was a founding member and contributing writer of <em>Slant</em>, a left-wing journal that ran from 1964 to 1970, which combined Catholic beliefs with Marxist theories.  His dialectical engagement of Marxism and Catholicism was published in <em>The New Left Church</em> (1966)<em>.  </em>As Eagleton commented during an interview more than 40 years later,</p><p class="quoteb">“I certainly don’t think it’s odd that Christianity and Marxism should go together in my career, or indeed in anybody’s career. They are both concerned with emancipation, and in the narrative of each the poor play a central role. Something I am very drawn to [in both] is that their assessment of the present state of humanity is very glum, whether that is because of original sin or the class society [...] At the same time there is a feasible capacity for transformation. They see things as being much more stark and realistic than most forms of progressive liberalism. They are both tragic but, in contrast to a merely fashionable postmodern pessimism, both believe in the possibility of change.” <br />(“Eagleton explains” 2008) </p><p>Eagleton’s interest in the political theology of the Catholic left informed much of his early writing.  </p><p>From 1992 to 2001, Eagleton was Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford.  He moved on to teach at the University of Manchester, serving as John Edward Taylor Professor of English Literature from 2001 to 2008.  Eagleton is a Fellow of both the British Academy and the English Association.  He has held visiting appointments at universities such as Cornell, Duke, Iowa, Melbourne, Notre Dame, Trinity College-Dublin, and Yale.  </p><p>In <em>The Function of Criticism</em>, Eagleton considers the ways in which working-class movements might create the opportunity for socialist intellectuals to become politically active within society.  He discusses how the working-class movement within the Weimer Republic “was not only a redoubtable political force; It was also equipped with its own theatres and choral societies, clubs and newspapers, recreation centres and social forums.  It was these conditions that helped to make possible a Brecht and a Benjamin, and to shift the role of critic from isolated intellectual to political functionary” (Eagleton 1984, p. 112).  </p><p>Eagleton reflects on British Marxist literary criticism, and considers the major responsibility of the socialist intellectual to address “an absent, counterpublic sphere, one based upon those very institutions of popular culture and education which failed to emerge in post-war Britain” (1984, p. 112).  This objective might be achieved through “the resolute popularization of complex ideas [...] [of] works which make socialist theory intelligible to a mass audience” (Eagleton 1984, p. 113), and which provide the “collective context” necessary for organizing and sustaining socialist institutions “of literary and intellectual production” (Eagleton 1984, p. 113).  Eagleton suggests contemporary critics have been devalued because of a lack of social purpose.  It is this lack of purpose that has led to the reduction of audience, and to critical responses to the system of values and meanings used to exert political power.  </p><p>Eagleton’s writings evidence his interest in the dialectical interaction between literature and ideology.  As literature reflects and represents dominant ideology, it also maintains the recessed potential for critiquing it.  In both <em>Criticism and Ideology </em>and<em> Ideology</em>: <em>An Introduction</em>, Eagleton emphasizes the paradoxical relationship between literature and ideology, as well as the often conflicting and contradictory meanings of ideology, a term that might be regarded as a “<em>text</em>, woven of a whole tissue of different conceptual strands [...] and divergent histories” (1991, p. 1 [Original emphasis]).  In <em>Ideology: An Introduction</em>, Eagleton provides a number of definitions for <a href="../../terms/i/d.htm#ideology">ideology</a>,</p><p class="indentb">(a) the process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life;<br />(b) a body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class;<br />(c) ideas which help to legitimate a dominant political power;<br />(d) false ideas which help to legitimate a dominant political power;<br />(e) systematically distorted communication;<br />(f) that which offers a position for a subject;<br />(g) forms of thought motivated by social interest;<br />(h) identity thinking;<br />(i) socially necessary illusion; <br />(j) the conjuncture of discourse and power;<br />(k) the medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world;<br />(l) action-oriented sets of beliefs;<br />(m) the confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality;<br />(n) semiotic closure;<br />(o) the indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure;<br />(p) the process whereby social life is converted to a natural reality.<br />(1976, p. 1-2) </p><p>Eagleton expresses a cautious response to “’vulgar’ Marxist” conceptions of literary works as an element in the “’base’ and ‘superstructure’” (1991, p. 100).  He draws from other theories of ideology developed by <a href="../../people/g/r.htm#gramsci-antonio">Antonio Gramsci</a> and <a href="../../people/l/u.htm#lukacs-georg">Georg Luckács</a>, as well as conceptions of the “revolutionary subject” found in the writings of Pierre Macherey, and argues that the literary text is neither a representation of dominant ideology, nor an autonomous element (1991, p. 100).  Literature reports dissonances and contradictions within ideology, and in “putting ideology to work, the text necessarily illuminates the absences, and begins to ‘make speak’ the silences of that ideology” (Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  For Eagleton, it becomes the critics’ task to analyze and evaluate literature’s relation to dominant ideology and “to the complex historical <em>articulations </em>of these structures which produce the text” (1976, p. 44-45).  Criticism must not “situate itself within the same space as the text” (Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  It must attempt to “install itself in the very incompleteness of the work in order to <em>theorise</em> it – to explain the ideological necessity of those ‘<em>not-saids’</em>” ([Original emphasis] Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  </p><p>Eagleton criticizes theorists such as <a href="../../people/a/d.htm#adorno-theodor">Theodor Adorno</a> and <a href="../../people/m/a.htm#marcuse-herbert">Herbert Marcuse</a>, who he suggests might have overestimated dominant ideology and instead claims, “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification, all the way from commodity fetishism and speech habits to political bureaucracy and technological thought” (1976, p. 46).  However, as Eagleton concedes, “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole” (1976, p. 36).  Eagleton considers the literary text as an “open” source of conflicting languages, symbols, and genres that reveal “the limits and absences which mark [ideology’s] relation to history” (1976, p. 95).  </p><p>In <em>Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism</em>, Eagleton examines the relation between Benjamin’s theoretical discourse and his own.  He describes the relation as “not one of reflection or reproduction” but more “a matter of imbricating the two languages to produce a third that belongs wholly to neither of us” (1981, p. xv).  Eagleton experiments with a political approach to literary studies by considering the body, carnivalesque and comedy, feminism, and cultural beliefs and practices.  His “critical account” positions Benjamin as a central figure in poststructuralist theory, whose work prefigures “many of the current motifs of post-structuralism” (1981, p. xvi) and “might be used to illuminate some key problems now confronting a ‘revolutionary criticism’” (1981, p. xv).  Eagleton prevents Benjamin’s Marxist theories from being “appropriated” and domesticated by the “critical establishment” (1981, p. xvi).  He presents Benjamin’s texts as collective backdrop for arguing interpretive strategies, as well as “an intervention into those [same] disputes” (1981, p. xvi).  </p><p>Perhaps one of Eagleton’s most relevant objectives was to challenge the existence and purpose of academic and cultural institutions that define and value systems of knowledge that inform our lives.  In <em>Literary Theory: An Introduction</em>, he surveys a number of critical approaches from New Criticism and phenomenology to poststructuralism and psychoanalysis and concludes that literature and literary theory do not exist as immutable objects and methods of analysis (Eagleton 1983, p. 9).  Literature is the “highly-valued writing” of a particular historical period that is subject to the judgment system of the dominant culture (Eagleton 1983, p. 9-10).  While literary methodologies have much more in common with other disciplines such as “linguistics, history, sociology, and so on” then with each other (Eagleton 1983, p.172).  Eagleton celebrates the lack of methodological unity in literary studies.  He attempts to make modern literary theory more accessible and “intelligible” to a wider readership, by familiarizing them with the “implications of theory beyond literature itself” (1983, p. vii).  Eagleton proposes a new and diverse form of rhetorical study capable of addressing “the various sign-systems and signifying practices in our own society, all the way from Moby Dick to the Muppet show, from Dryden and Jean-Luc Goddard to the portrayal of women in advertisements and the rhetorical techniques of government reports” (1983, p.207).  Eagleton’s idea of diversity in critical methods and objects of analysis limits the potential for “’pure’ literary critical judgment or interpretation” or “high culture,” and allows for the possibility of a more political and historical form of literary analysis (1983, p.18, 22).  </p><p>Eagleton considers the state of literary and cultural theory in <em>After Theory</em> (2003).  </p><p>Eagleton reflects on the theoretical contributions of golden age philosophers such as <a href="../../people/a/l.htm#althusser-louis">Louis Althusser</a>, <a href="../../people/b/a.htm#barthes-roland">Roland Barthes</a>, and <a href="../../people/d/e.htm#derrida-jacques">Jacques Derrida</a> while questioning how we have “moved beyond them” (2003, p. 2).  As he suggests,</p><p class="quoteb">The generations which followed after these path-breaking figures did what generations which follow after usually do. They developed the original ideas, added to them, criticized them and applied them. Those who can, think up feminism or structuralism; those who can’t, apply such insights to <em>Moby-Dick</em> or <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. But the new generation came up with no comparable body of ideas of its own” (2003, p. 2). </p><p>He considers the influence of sexuality and popular culture on critical studies.  He criticizes graduate students who have come to devalue the study of everyday life as “intricate, unfathomable, obscure, and occasionally tedious,” while often simultaneously writing “uncritical, reverential essays on <em>Friends</em>” (Eagleton 2003, p. 4-5).  Rather than trying to change the world, as Eagleton suggests, they have turned away from political action and displaced the impulse of the larger socialist movements of the golden age, and this counterturn has been a “politically catastrophic one” (2003, p. 16).  </p><p>As Eagleton suggests, doctoral students, once a reservoir of critical innovation, now consider themselves responsible for facilitating an “oppositional” culture that lacks political impulses, and their research reflects a disposition of theoretical amnesia.  For Eagleton, they concentrate on “sensationalist subjects like vampirism and eye-gouging, cyborgs and porno movies,” which are of greater interest but less cultural and political value (2003, p. 3).  As Eagleton contends, for younger theorists “the politics of masturbation exert far more fascination than the politics of the Middle East” (2003, p. 2).  As intellectual matters retreat into the repetitions of everyday life, students endure “the risk of losing their ability to subject it to critique” (Eagleton 2003, p. 3).  </p><p>Throughout his work, Eagleton has continuously attempted to harness political impulses, refashion rhetorical language, and educate readers about their relation to mass culture.  His desire to analyze and evaluate the tradition of criticism and the role of the critic has influenced students and theorists alike.  His arguments against postmodernism, a movement he once endorsed in <em>Literary Theory</em>, and in defense of Marxist theory provide a valuable critique of capitalism.  His theoretical turns and counterturns demonstrate the progression of a scholar toward a more mature and sophisticated understanding of his role as critic.  Eagleton urges his readers to ask questions and, in so doing, uncover contradictions within our selves and the cultural and political structures that shape our interactions.  Through his collective writings, Eagleton defends Marxist theory and attempts to provide his readers with a morally conscionable view of the world and their relation to it.  </p><h5>Works Cited</h5><p class="fst">Eagleton, Terry. <em>After Theory</em>.

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Einstein, Albert (1879-1955)', 'glossary/people/e/pics/th-einstein.jpg', 'Physicist, one of the most creative intellects in history, advanced a series of theories that proposed entirely new ways of thinking about space, time, matter and gravitation and revolutionised science and philosophy. Einstein also possessed a “passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility”, though his endeavours in this field were not as successful.</p><p>Born to the family of a small-scale industrialist in Germany, Einstein left school at 15 with poor grades in the humanities and without any diploma. His family had moved in the meantime however to Milan and the young Einstein went to join them and resumed his education in Switzerland, graduating in 1900 in physics and mathematics at the renowned Federal Polytechnic Academy in Zürich.</p><p>After graduating, Einstein became a Swiss citizen, and went to work as an examiner at the Swiss patent office in Bern. After publishing his PhD thesis for the University of Zürich, <span class="book">A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions</span> early in 1905, only 9 years after his first lesson in Physics, Einstein published four papers that transformed natural science forever.</p><p class="indentb"><span class="book">On the Motion - Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat - of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid</span>, applied statistical methods to demonstrate that the observed “wandering” of particles suspended in a liquid (“Brownian Motion”) was exactly as would be caused by the random impact of the unseen molecules of the liquid. This was the first experimental proof of the existence of the molecules, which Ernst Mach had regarded as no more than theoretical constructs.</p><p class="indentb"><span class="book">On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</span>, drew on Max Planc\' observation that the spectrum of black-body radiation corresponded to the spectrum that would be expected if the emission of light resulted from discrete events, Einstein postulated that light is composed of individual quanta, in addition to exhibiting wave-like behaviour – a revolutionary approach to resolution of the seemingly inexplicable contradiction between Planc\' observation and the accumulated mass of theory explaining optical phenomena on the basis of wave propagation. In the light of subequent history it is often forgotten that it was Einstein who made the quantum revolution, despite the fact that he would later maintain fundamental disagreements with the mainstream proponents of quantum mechanics.</p><p class="indentb"><span class="book">On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</span> put forward what became known as the Special Theory of Relativity (special because it did not consider accelerated bodies, but only bodies in constant or “inertial” motion). Physics had been struggling with the contradictions arising from the Michelson-Morley experiment which demonstrated that the speed of light from the Sun measured on the surface of the Earth did not depend on the motion of the earth towards or away from the Sun, or through the “ether”. Lorentz had worked out that if the length of a body increased or decreased by a certain ratio according to its speed through the ether, then the result could be explained, but there was absolutely no rationale for such a dilation. Einstei\' approach was entirely novel. Rather than questioning the results of the experiment or postulating new properties for the ether to explain the result, or calling into question Maxwel\' laws of electro-dynamics which were only a few decades old, or even Newto\' laws which were 200 years old, he assumed that all these laws were true and in fact postulated that all the laws of physics were <em>invariant with respect to transformation between inertial frames of reference</em> – i.e. the laws of physics were unaffected by movement through a co-called ether, and called into question Eucli\' 2,000 year-old geometry. He subjected to painstaking, meticulous examination, the practice of measurement of time intervals and distances on which our conception of time and space are based. Through a series of “thought-experiments” he demonstrated that Lorent\' transformation was a simple, geometric result of the measurement process. The chief result was therefore to show that space and time had to be conceived in terms of the measurement processes they were associated with, rather than as entities which could be grasped by pure reason, something which everyone from Euclid to Kant and beyond had taken to be the case.</p><p class="indentb"><span class="book">Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?</span> was an addendum to the Special Relativity paper which observed that the famous <em>E</em> = <em>mc</em><SUP>2</SUP> followed from the theory. The equivalence between energy (E) and mass (m) knocked yet another fixture away from the physical conception of the world, and would of course later have the most profound effect on world politics with its application to the production of nuclear energy and the atom bomb.</p><p>These papers were quickly recognised by physicists around the world for the revolutionary achievements that they were. He left the patent office and by 1914 was at the University of Berlin, continuing research towards his <em>general</em> theory which would deal with accelerated motion and, what amounted to the same thing in Einstei\' theory, gravitation, with only occasional requirements to lecture. His wife and two sons were trapped in Switzerland by the outbreak of the War and divorce followed a few years later. Mileva Maric was also a physicist and being married to the greatest physicist of all time was not an easy thing. While continuing with his work, Einstein distributed some pacifist literature to sympathisers in Berlin.</p><p>Einstein published the highly readable <span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/archive/einstein/works/1910s/relative/index.htm" target="_top">Relativity: The Special and General Theory</a></span> in 1916, written for the general public and without complex mathematics, and <em>later</em> published the <span class="book">The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity</span> in which the approach he had developed in dealing with uniform motion was applied to accelerated motion. If you were falling in a lift, under the influence of gravity, then the appearance would be “weightlessness”, but you would be falling faster and faster, and despite the fact that you can see nothing other than the lift which is falling with you, you can <em>feel</em> the falling. In other words, not only are the laws of physics <em>variant</em> with respect to accelerated motion, but acceleration is interchangeable with a gravitational field. The mathematical tool which allowed Einstein to deal with the complexities of this analysis was Rieman\' Tensor Calculus – a “solution waiting for a problem”. This allowed Einstein to express the fundamental laws of physics in an entirely new way. The “forces” which had dominated 18th and 19th century physics were no longer present – only forms of movement expressed in equations of incredible simplicity, from which Maxwel\' and Newto\' laws cold be derived as special cases. It was Minkowski who later showed that they also allowed for the conception of a “4-dimensional distance”, in which time figures as a 4-th dimension but only by combination with the square root of minus one! Thus arose the mind-bending conceptions of “curved space-time”</p><p>The idea of large masses causing space-time to be curved could be verified by observing the bending of light rays during a total eclipse and in November 1919, the British Royal Society announced that an expidition which had been launched while the war was still raging had observed a solar eclipse and verified Einstei\' predictions.</p><p>Despite the deteriorating political situation in Germany, Einstein continued to attack nationalism and militarism and spoke out against anti-semitism. Einstein toured around the world lecturing on his theory while under constant attack by Nazis at home. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921.</p><p>During the 1920s, quantum mechanics continued to develop with <a href="../b/o.htm#bohr-niels">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="../h/e.htm#heisenberg-werner">Werner Heisenberg</a> among those at the centre of this work. The formal character of the relativity theory and the quantum theory were very different and it was difficult to see how the two lines of development could be unified. Einstein continued to seek a resolution through a Unified Field Theory (the first attempt at which he published in 1929), and this kind of approach continues to this day though the terms have changed considerably. However, Einstein retained up to the time of his death reservations about the interpretation of the Schrödinger Wave equation, which determines the <em>probabilty</em> of quantum events. Einstein never accepted that such an interpretation could be regarded as a complete description of a physical system, that events could be fundamentally without cause.</p><p><em>Further Reading on this matter:</em> <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Boh\' Report of his Discussions with Einstein</span></a> and <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/einstein.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Einstei\' Reply</span></a>.</p><p>As the world situation deteriorated, Einstein spent more and more effort in promoting pacifism including the establishment of a War Resister\'International Fund. In a famous exchange of letters with the Austrian psychiatrist <a href="../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Sigmund Freud</a>, Einstein speculated on the psychological basis for the war and fascism he saw around him. In a discussion of epistemology with the Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, Einstein defended basic philosophical materialist positions and in particular indicated support for the Pantheism of <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ne/spinoza.htm" target="_top">Spinoza</a>.</p><p>When Hitler came to power in 1933, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and emigrated to England, moving to the U.S. in 1935 for a position at Princeton where he lived for the remainder of his life. From this time, Einstein urged Europe to arm and prepare for the inevitable war with Hitler. Most Western nations at this time regarded Hitler as a good anti-communist and Einstei\' advocacy of war was given as little heed as had his pacificism.</p><p>In 1939, <a href="../../people/b/o.htm#bohr-niels">Niels Bohr</a>, told Einstein of Lise Meitne\' success in splitting the uranium atom, and speculated on the prospect for the creation of an atom bomb. Though Einstein was sceptical, he was persuaded to write to President Roosevelt to begin atomic-bomb research. He was not included in the team that worked at Los Alamos and did not learn that a nuclear bomb had been made until Hiroshima was razed in 1945. He then joined those scientists seeking ways to prevent any future use of the bomb, his particular and urgent plea being the establishment of a world government under a constitution drafted by the US, Britain, and Russia. </p><p>By 1937, after years of failure advocating peaceful attempts to change the world, Einstein became involved with Communism. For the remainder of his life he would be a member, sponsor, or affiliate of at least 34 Communist organisations; and chaired three Communist organisations. Einstein spoke out against capitalism, and i\' concentration of power into the hands of the few, and stressed the need for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalist governments. Such ideas did not go unnoticed: the FBI began documenting his activities and speeches, and filed claims against his "communist-anarchist" politics, ammassing into a <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/Albert%20Einstein">1,427 page report</a> by the time of his death. In 1949, Einstei\' agitation gained wider attention when he wrote <span class="book"><a href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm">Why Socialism?</a></span>, explaining that the only way for humanity to rid itself of the evils of capitalism is through the adoptation of Socialism. Einstein did not fully approve of Stalinist Socialism; arguing on several points in letters to Soviet scientists that freedom is necessary for Socialism to work.</p><p>The rejection of his ideals by bureaucrats on both sides did not break him, however, because his prime obsession still remained with physics. He published his new version of the unified field in 1950, a most meticulous mathematical essay that was immediately criticised by most physicists as untenable.</p><p>Compared with his renown of a generation earlier, Einstein was virtually neglected and ostracised in his later years; he said that he felt almost like a stranger in the world. His health deteriorated to the extent that he could no longer play the violin or sail his boat. On April 18, 1955, Einstein died in his sleep at Princeton Hospital.</p>')

He was also a leader of the International Red Aid (MOPR) organization based in Moscow.</p><p>The son of Swedish Luthern immigrants, J. Louis Engdahl (who went by his middle name, “Louis”) was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 11, 1884. Engdahl was intelligent and well educated, he graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1907, having paid his way through school by working as a telegraph operator and as City Editor of the <em>Minneapolis Daily News.</em> Engdahl was a member of the Socialist Party from 1908.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> In 1909, he took a position as the Labor Editor of the <em>Chicago Daily Socialist</em>, assuming the mantle of Editor of that publicaton from 1910 until its termination in 1912.</p><p>Engdahl attended the Copenhagen Congress of the Socialist International in 1910 as a journalist on behalf of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation. He joined the Socialist Party of America in September of 1912. Despite his traveling to Europe for the Scandinavian Federation, it does not seem that Engdahl ever directly participated in language federation politics in any way.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup></p><p>Louis Engdahl was a Socialist candidate for US Congress from Illinois in 1916; for the Chicago City Council in 1917; again for Congress in the Illinois 7th C.D. in 1918. He also was on the Organizing Committee of the Communist Propaganda League of Chicago from its origin in 1918 until its demise in 1919.</p><p>In 1914, Engdahl assumed the position of Editor of <em>The American Socialist,</em> the Chicago-based official organ of the SPA. He continued to edit this newspaper each week until it was suppressed by postal authorities in 1917. Thereafter, he moved to the successor weekly publication, <em>The Eye Opener,</em> which he continued to edit until 1919.</p><p>In February of 1918, Engdahl’s aggressive antimilitarism caused him to run afoul of the US Department of Justice, who targeted him as editor of the Socialist Party’s weekly newspaper under the Espionage Act for undermining the American military conscription program. Along with his party comrades Adolph Germer, Victor L. Berger, Bill Kruse, and Irwin St. John Tucker, Engdahl was indicted by a grand jury. The quintet was brought to trial before the harsh Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis on December 6, 1918 (that is, after the war had ended), with the trial ending during the first week of January 1919. The jury found all five guilty as charged, and Judge Landis imposed a draconian sentence of 20 years in the Federal Penitentiary upon each. This sentence was later overturned on appeal for the reason of judicial bias.</p><p>Out pending appeal on $25,000 bond, Engdahl was a delegate from Illinois to the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party, refusing to either support Adolph Germer, James Oneal, and the party regulars or to bolt the convention to join either of the fledgling Communist organizations – the Communist Labor Party or the Communist Party of America. Instead, Engdahl stayed inside the Socialist Party as a leader of the remaining Left Wing faction, which congealed as the Committee for the Third International in 1920. Engdahl served as Secretary of this faction until it departed the party in the aftermath of the 1921 Convention.</p><p>From 1920 until July of 1921, Engdahl served as editor of the <em>Chicago Socialist,</em> publication of Local Cook County of the SPA, until he was finally removed for political reasons. He was also the Secretary of Local Cook County SPA until his resignation on July 21, 1921.</p><p>After the disappointment of the 1921 Convention of the SPA, the Committee for the Third International left the party to mark the world with a short-lived existence as part of the Workers Council group – a small group of Communist adherents who sought to turn their backs on the sectarian infighting of the underground Communist parties. This pro-Comintern/anti-underground position proved to be timely, as in December 1921, at the Comintern’s request, a “Legal Political Party” called the Workers Party of America was established at a convention in New York. The Workers Council group was absorbed into the WPA at this time. He was elected to the 7 member “Administrative Council” of the WPA on Oct. 10, 1921. He stood as the WPA’s candidate for Congress in the New York 12th C.D. in 1922. In January 1923 he was elected by the 2nd Convention of the WPA to the party’s Central Executive Committee and sat on the inner circle of this group called the Executive Council.</p><p>Engdahl was employed as Managing Editor of the WPA’s organ, <em>The Worker,</em> from 1922. When that paper moved to daily status in January 1924, Engdahl wore the hat of Editor, although as an adherent of the minority Pepper-Ruthenberg-Lovestone faction, he was saddled with a co-editor from the majority Foster-Cannon-Lore faction in February. He continued as an Editor at <em>The Daily Worker</em> until 1928.</p><p>In February of 1925, Engdahl was a candidate of the Workers (Communist) Party for Chicago City Alderman.</p><p>From May 1927 through February 1928, Engdahl was a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, representing the Workers (Communist) Party of America.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>In July 1929, Engdahl was appointed by the CEC of the Communist Party as National Secretary of International Labor Defense (ILD), the party’s legal aid arm.

All Knowledge is by virtue of God, and the Ego is first manifested in the form of a primitive Intuition, and “this Power, which now through perception and recognition of itself has become an Ego.” </p><p>Thought, or “intelligising”, is based on the activity of this Intuition. For Fichte, the Doctrine of Knowledge was exclusively concerned with studying thought-forms, concepts, and for him there could be no question of understanding “the object before its expression in a concept.” He abolished Kant’s dualism by putting rejection altogether any concern with “things-in-themselves”, beyond sensation. This was a “subjective idealist” solution to Kant’s scepticism. </p><p class="quote">There can be an Actual Being out of God only through the self-realisation of this absolute Power: - this Power, however, can only produce pictures or Schemae, which by combination become Actual Knowledge. </p><p>Intuition was essentially ridden with contradiction because Intuition reflected Being in continual movement and change. Thus contradiction was not a product of imperfect thought, but derived from Intuition and ultimately from movement and change in the world beyond knowledge. Nevertheless, Fichte aimed to establish a doctrine of knowledge which would be comprehensive and free of contradictions, describing the general laws of the movement of thought-forms. Kant insisted that this was impossible, and did not accept Fichte’s criticisms.</p><p>Fichte sought to build up a science of the forms of thought based on their evolution from the primitive forms of Intuition. Logic was but a subordinate formal system within the Doctrine of Knowledge, not its “master.” This approach is an important step towards the system of Logic later developed by Hegel and presages also the genetic epistemology of more recent times.</p><p>However, it is the subjective-idealism of Fichte’s solution which has proved to be the most influential since - the logical positivists and others who emphasise concepts as constructs of the Mind and reject any possibility of the existence of things outside the mind to which these concepts refer.</p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../archive/fichte/index.htm" target="_top">Johann Gottlieb Fichte Archive</a>.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> Fichte’s <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/fichte.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Outlines of the Doctrine of Knowledge</span></a>.

Foucault shows how an issue (such as sexuality) is deemed in one period to be a religious issue, at another a medical problem, at another an issue of crime and punishment, and so on. However, Foucaul\' method militates against all kinds of generalisation, all conceptions of “historical period” for example, which he regarded as a questionable construction. The relation of his method to that of his Structuralist predecessors is much like that of mathematical analysis (based on ideas of continuity) to discrete mathematics, in which only numbers exist.

For all its faults, Freud’s theory was the first materialist theory of the psyche; like his contemporary Pavlov, Freud was a philosophical materialist of the old school, and between them they mark a watershed between the psychology of the 19th and that of the 20th centuries. While Freud was careful not to claim expertise outside his own area of work, his followers have freely applied his concepts to history and society in a way that Freud would not have supported.</p><p>Freu\' father was a Jewish merchant who had been married once before and was 40 years old when Freud was born, a relatively remote and authoritarian figure. In 1860 the family moved to Vienna, where Freud remained until the Nazi invasion in 1939. </p><p>In 1873, Freud entered the University of Vienna to study medicine, where he worked with  Ernst von Brücke, an exponent of <a href="../../people/h/e.htm#helmholtz-hermann">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>'s anti-vitalism. In 1882, he entered the General Hospital in Vienna to train in psychiatry, and was appointed lecturer in neuropathology. It was during this period that Freud advocated the use of cocaine, leading to a close friend becoming addicted, and this episode left somewhat of a cloud over his reputation for a time.</p><p>In 1885, Freud went to Paris, to work under Jean-Martin Charcot who was using hypnosis to cure patients suffering from paralysis. The idea of treating apparently physiological disorders by treating the <em>mind</em>, ran directly counter to the dominant positivistic spirit of the science of the day. Freud never succeeded in mastering the art of hypnosis, and this obliged him to develop an alternative method of working on the mind. Nevertheless, Freud now had the key idea which was to determine his future work, and returned to Vienna after a very short stay in Paris.</p><p>It was the physician Josef Breuer, who had cured an hysterical patient by simply encouraging her to talk about her problem, who provided Freud with a line of research, and 10 years later he published a joint paper with Breuer on the use of free association as a technique for uncovering the roots of psychosis.</p><p>The key insight to which the work with free association led Freud was that there was something called the “Unconscious” (not a concept that Freud invented, but he was the first to systematically investigate it and develop a definite conception of the structure of the psyche), but for whatever reason the content of this Unconscious mind was repressed and hidden from consciousness; however, from time to time people would make a “slip of the tongue” or in one way or another say something from which the contents of the Unconscious could be inferred. The point then was to develop ways of bringing these unconscious thoughts to light so that the patient themselves could deal with them.</p><p>In the course of this study – to which he gave the name ‘Psychoanalysis’ in 1896 – Freud formed the view that the principal content of this unconscious was sexual, even though the patients did not directly articulate this. For example, a recollection of sexual contact with an adult in their childhood, Freud took to be evidence of sexuality on the part of the child, expressed in the form of fantasy.</p><p>Freu\' early work concentrated on female hysteria, but in order to formulate a general theory of the mind, Freud had to broaden his work to study the psyche of the normal male. Freud began by studying the one psyche to which he had direct access – his own. However, the psychoanalytic movement he began reserved the privilege of self-analysis for its founder alone; every psychoanalyst is inducted into the profession by being psychoanalysed by a psychoanalyst, thus joining a genealogy linking back to Sigmund Freu\' original self-analysis.</p><p>In <span class="book">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, he interspersed evidence from his own dreams with evidence from those recounted in his clinical practice. Freud saw dreams as essentially a form of wish fulfilment, in which the real meaning of the unconscious is “coded” in the form of images taken from everyday experience, and regarded dreams as the “royal road to the unconscious”.</p><p>Centred on the concept of repression of sexual desire, Freud developed explanations for hysteria, obsessive compulsions, paranoia, and narcissism. However, it should be noted that a considerable part of Freu\' achievement is easily separable from his conviction that sexual frustration lay at the root of all these disorders. Although Freu\' theories scandalised the sexually repressed Vienna of his day, they attracted wide interest across Europe, and in 1902 Freu\' so-called Psychological Wednesday Circle began to gather, including <a href="../../people/a/d.htm#adler-alfred">Alfred Adler</a> and Wilhelm Stekel and <a href="../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl">Carl Jung</a> among participants. In 1908, the group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society which grew to become an international organisation, but the Society was always marked by sharp splits between its founder and others who grew to rival him, such as Alfred Adler who Freud broke with in 1911, followed by breaks with Stekel, Jung and Wilhelm Reich.</p><p>Freud constructed a very elaborate “topology” for the Mind, including the division of the psyche into the Unconscious, Preconscious, and Conscious and structural components called the Id, the Ego, and the Superego.

In a world dominated by the dogmatic enforcement of the teachings of Aristotle, Galileo used the systematic application of the experimental method to formulate the most basic laws of mechanics - inertia and the principle of the relativity of motion. By applying the telescope to observation of the skies, Galileo proved the validity of Copernicu\' heliocentric system. Galileo thus developed a scientific method based on observation, experiment and the method of induction and a mechanical, causal conception of Nature. As is well-known, Galileo suffered severe repression from the Church for his views, and was forced to write God into his system.</p><p>A good exposition of his works can be found in "The Galileo Affair", which collects together a series of letters and statements by Galileo with the documents of the Inquisition demanding that Galileo recant and affirm the literal interpretation of the Bible upheld by the Inquisitors. The final document is Galile\' "self-criticism".</p><p>In 1600, the great Italian materialist philosopher, Giodarno Bruno, had been burnt at the stake for, among other things, upholding the Copernican conception of the Heliocentric universe, and despite the fact that Copernicus had been commissioned by the Church to formulate a better method of predicting the movement of the heavens in order to overcome defects in the Calendar, he was also forced to recant.</p><p>Not only are Galile\' arguments in defence of the Copernican view compelling to the point where it is difficult for us to comprehend today how the Inquisitors could withstand them, but Galileo also demonstrates that they may silence him in vain, for conditions of life in Europe were leading more and more people to observe with their own eyes the movement and form of the heavenly bodies, and more and more people were coming to the same conclusions as he, and the Church would do well to stay away from anything that might prove liable to refutation by empirical obervation or naturalistic reason.</p><p>In this short article, the profundity of Galile\' understanding of the nature and tasks of natural science is astounding. Not only does he present the argument in favour of the Heliocentric System with a fine balance of empirical evidence and the evidence of Reason, but he very explicitly rejects the "compromise" offered him - to admit that the heliocentric assumption is made solely "for the convenience of organising the observations", and not at all a statement that material bodies actually move in this way, outside of human perception! Right at the very beginning of the development of natural science then, we see its greatest advocate recognising positivism in the camp of theology! On the contrary, he says, astronomers have to reduce the positions calculated on the basis of a theory of objective heliocentric motion to lines-of-sight referred to the point of view of an Earthly observer in order to be able to utilise the mass of experiemental data, all of which is made by Earth-bound human observers - in other words the germs of the twentieth century Principle of Correspondence, used by <a href="../../people/e/i.htm#einstein-albert">Einstein</a> in his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity.</p><p>Also, we see a clear formulation of the principle of relativity, and the conception of the distinciton between Essence and Appearance, inso far as Galileo distinguishes between the "idealised" motion and the minor "deviations" from that trajectory.</p><p> Galilieo also did fundamental work on mechanics, rolling balls down inclined slopes and timing them with a very primitive "stop watch".</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> Galilelo: <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/it/galileo.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">On the Copernican Opinion</span></a>.</p>')

An early supporter of the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, his 1900 “De Kant à Nietzsche” presents Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as alternatives to the Kantism then regnant in the philosophical world. His greatest contribution is the concept of “<em>bovarysme</em>, “which he initially developed in his 1892 “Le Bovarysme, la Psychologie dans l’Oeuvre de Flaubert” (“Bovarysm, or Psychology in the Oeuvre of Flaubert”) and which he elaborated on in “Le Bovarysme, Essai sur le Pouvoir de l’Imagination,” (“Bovarysm, Essay on the Power of the Imagination”) published in 1902. <em>Bovarysme</em> is defined as “man’s power to conceive himself other than he is,” i.e., the power of our imagination to overwhelm our true natures, of our imagination of the coloration of situations to lead us to misinterpret these situations. Gaultier found the basis for this theory in Flaubert’s character Emma Bovary, whose (fictional) life came to a sad end because the character viewed all around her, all that occurred to her through the prism of her romantic notions. Starting with the application of his theory to the individual, Gaultier expanded his use of this concept to history and human society, with nations misleading themselves concerning their true nature , their “national genius,” and history in general being viewed through a false prism. The theory thus has a negative and a positive character: it leads individuals and nations to misjudge themselves, but it also implies the ability to act, to escape the boundaries one has been set. </p><p>Gaultier played a central role in precipitating the suicide of his former friend, the individualist philosopher Georges Palante. Gaultier had helped Palante succeed him as philosophy critic at the “Mercure de France, “ and their relations had always been more than cordial. But an unfavorable review by Palante of Gaultier’s “La Philosophie officielle et la Philosophie” in 1922 led to an unpleasant exchange of correspondence, which finally led to Gaultier’s challenging Palante to a duel. For the rest of his days Palante felt himself to have been rendered ridiculous by the process. Stéphane Beau says in an essay on the relations between the two men that “the duel manqué certainly weighed among the burdens that made [Palante’s] life unbearable, but the connection is too tenuous for us to read a cause and effect relation” between it and Palante’s death. There is no question though that it was a contributing factor, and he committed suicide in 1925. </p><p class="inline">Mitchell Abidor</p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../archive/gaultier/index.htm" target="_top">Gaultier Archive</a></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../g.htm">Index of the Letter G</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

As semi-wealthy Jews, Goldman and her family at times suffered from social and political persecution. By the time she was 16 (1885), in conflict with her father who tried to marry her off, she emigrated with her half-sister to the United States (Rochester, New York), where she began working in clothing factories. At 19, she was married for ten months, when she divorced her husband. Her two volume, 56 chapter autobiography <em>Living My Life </em>, begins three years after her arrival in the United States:</p><p class="quote">IT WAS THE 15TH OF AUGUST 1889, THE DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN New York City.

But I had youth, good health, and a passionate ideal. Whatever the new held in store for me I was determined to meet unflinchingly.</p><p>After her move, she became close to Alexander Berkman, who together (in 1892) attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, during the homestead steel strike. To raise money for buying the gun, Goldman unsuccessfully tried to prostitute herself. Their attempt of assassination was a failure, Frick was slightly injured, and workers were not at all incited to revolt. Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison, while Goldman attempted to defend Berkman with a passionately moral argument; her own involvement in the assassination was not tried. </p><p>By 1893, however, Goldman was imprisoned for her first time, after attempting to incite striking workers to revolt. Goldman was again imprisoned after distributing birth control literature. In 1906, Berkman was freed early from his prison term, and together they began again political education – founding Mother Earth, a periodical Goldman edited until it was forcibly suppressed by the U.S. government in 1917. In 1908 her naturalization as a U.S. citizen was revoked. Goldmann nevertheless stayed in the U.S., and continued to publicly speak on anarchism and also on the current European drama of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, George Bernard Shaw, and others.</p><p> In 1917, Goldman was imprisoned again (for two years) for setting up "No Conscription" leagues and speaking out against the <em>US</em> involvement in the war.

She was horrified by the terrible living conditions in Russia and the repressive Soviet government. In the beginning she strongly spoke out against the government for its repressive measures against those who were attacking it during the <a href="../../events/r/u.htm#rcw"> Civil War</a>.  After the end of the (Western) Civil War, the nation in ruins by the destruction, Goldman chastised the government for the poor living conditions.  When the Soviet government began encouraging the opposition parties, once brutally repressed, to help rebuild the nation, Goldman was outraged, believing that this was the ultimate compromise of revolutionary principles – to allow these "bourgeois" into the government.  A few other anarchists joined Goldman in voicing extreme opposition to this, and attempted to start another Civil War.  The first and last result of these attempts happened at Kronstadt, where mutinying soldiers attempted to lead a Civil War against the Soviet government. After this was brutally crushed by the Soviet government, Goldman, to disillusioned to continue to be revolutionary, left Soviet Russia for Western Europe.</p><p>In the last 20 years of her life she remained active through lecturing and writing.

He was keen student of the classics and became a teacher of Greek and Latin. Gorter created a great stir with his poem, <em>May</em>, which expressed a worship of nature in a language never heard before. He broke with tradition and established rules and expressed the feelings as they were actually felt. In 1880, Gorter gathered about him a group of young poets and developed the literary revolution known as “the movement of the Eighties.” </p><p>But Gorter soon perceived that this movement did not go very far and he turned to a study of ancient of Greek and Egyptian culture to understand the reason of their powerful development. The result was expressed in an essay: Critique of the movement of the Eighties. </p><p>Gorter studied philosophy, translating Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em>, studying Immanuel Kant and finally reading Marx’s <em>Capital</em>. In Marx he had found what he wanted and he began a deep study of the writings of Marx and Engels. </p><p>In 1890, Gorter joined the social Democratic Labour Party in Holland, S.D.A.P. At first the party rejoiced in his membership, but he soon found himself in conflict with the Party leadership. Nevertheless, he emerged as a great marxist theoretician and one of the most powerful speakers in Holland. <em>Het Volk</em>, the social democratic organ, complained that socialism was, to him a fine dream, an unattainable utopia. He was a clear and convincing speaker, they said, but he disrupted the party with his accusations of political corruption and careerism. </p><p>As the tendency towards reformism became more marked in the S.D.A.P.. Gorter exposed the capitalistic compromises and treacheries of the S.D.A.P. and the fight became very sharp. A marxist group was formed within the S.D.A.P., but most of this group was expelled in 1909 and formed a Marxist party under the title of the <a href="../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp">SPD</a> (Sozialistische Partei Deutschlands, Social-Democratic Party) . Gorter joined the SDP. </p><p>That year the SDP published Gorter’s work, <em>Marxism and Revisionism, </em>defending Marxist ideas against Bernsteinian revisionism, and supporting the SDP’s analysis of capitalist society. At the outbreak of the First World War, the SDP leaders, Winjnkoop and Ravensteijn, were elected to Parliament. The unionised workers of Holland, the mass base of the SDP, were in a majority opposed to “Prussianism” and inclined to sympathy with “allied” imperialism. As a result of this pressure, Winjnkoop and Ravensteijn upheld the “allied cause” in Parliament . </p><p>When the world war broke out, Herman Gorter opposed the way in which the leaders of Social Democracy placed itself at the disposal of “their own” bourgeoisie. He analysed the causes of the collapse of the socialist movement, in his work, <em>Imperialism, Social Democracy, and World War</em>. </p><p>Gorter showed that it made no difference to the workers which of the imperialist alliances won the war. For the workers in all lands the issues remained the same. Imperialism was not destroyed by capitalist wars. There was only one way in which the workers could destroy Imperialism: that was the way of World revolution. </p><p>The Russian Revolution of October 1917, found in Gorter an enthusiastic defender. Gorter held that to triumph, the revolution had to be a world revolution. </p><p>With his friend, Anton Pannekoek, Gorter analysed the Russian Revolution in terms of historical materialism. They show how this revolution was in part a proletarian, and in part a peasant, and therefore bourgeois revolution. The peasants desired and private property and division of the land. Against 10 million workers, inclined to socialist understanding, there were over 100 million peasants, with capitalistic ideology. If the world revolution all the proletariat came to help, these ten millions would become part of the mighty proletariat that conquered and emancipated the world. But if they world revolution did not come to the aid of the Bolsheviks, then it was determined by the class conditions existing in Russia that a new capitalist period would set in. And the consequence would be that Russia would change from being the centre of world revolution, into a powerful ally of world Capitalism, allied to other capitalist states, in enmity to the working class struggle. </p><p>In 1921, Gorter travelled illegally to the Third Congress of the Third International, as a delegate of the K.A.P.D. Lenin had published his work <em>“Left-Wing” Communism an Infantile Disorder</em>, cautioning against attempts to replicate the Russian Revolution in Europe without the necessary conditions and preparation. </p><p>Gorter opposed the analysis Lenin made in this work. He responded with a pamphlet entitled <em>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</em> claiming that Lenin’s strategy of compromise with the peasantry must lead to the failure if applied to Western Europe and therefore undermine the world struggle for socialism. Leninism, he held, would prolong the struggle and increase the cost in suffering and hardship to the workers. </p><p>In opposition to what he saw as a Leninist “dictatorship <em>over</em> the proletariat,” and reduction of the Communist Parties to “legal” parties, Gorter developed left wing tactics anti-Parliamentarism. Gorter saw the construction of workers’ councils (soviets) as an achievement of the workers’ movement itself, not that of theoreticians, and declared that every period of the class struggle has its own laws, according to which the rank-and-file develops its own forces. The workers had discovered that in those countries where they had built parliamentary parties and trade unions, these same organisations opposed every proletarian action. Thus, the shop committee (or council, or soviet) became, in Gorter’s view, the form in which the proletarian consciousness found its expression. </p><p>Gorter thought that Lenin did not understand the different conditions in the West, and, therefore, erred in the tactics he urged on the workers of Western Europe. </p><p>Gorter and Pannekoek developed the theoretical statement of the Left Wing. They declared that in the West the proletariat is the only power for revolution, and must grow in class consciousness and power consciousness. Parliamentarism must be destroyed as the safety valve of class society, and trade unions must be repudiated as parliamentarism on the industrial field, an extension bourgeois society. The Left-wing would not except the 21 points for admission to the Communist International, and was expelled. But Gorter viewed the breaking down of the Third International as inevitable, but saw communism as certain to revive and eventually triumph. </p><p>Herman Gorter died in Brussels on September 15, 1927. He had gone to Switzerland from his home in Holland to renew his health, but he felt that the end of his life was near, and so he broke off his stay in Switzerland and tried to return home. But he was obliged to break his journey at Brussels, and died the same night in the hotel. He spent his last ten hours making arrangements for his unpublished writings and issuing strict instructions that nobody should speak at his grave.</p>')

At the same time Grossman was one of the main organisers of the People’s University. In addition to general educational and cultural activities the People’s University provided a key forum for open political discussion.

My sole concern here is to fill this gap in the Marxist tradition.” </p><p>The Comintern wrongly interpreted Grossman’s book as suggesting the automatic breakdown of capitalism, and condemned <em>The Law of Accumulation</em>. When the Institute was closed down, Grossmann fled to Paris where he published a study of the origins of the modern scientific worldview, arguing that the technological advances associated with early capitalism provided the foundations for mechanistic scientific theory. </p><p>He also reassessed the sectarian Communist strategy which had prevented a united working class fight against the Nazis in Germany.

Paz, secretary of the SFIO’s colonies committee.</p><p>In January 1938 the Gauche Révolutionnaire gained control of the SFIO’s Seine Federation, and Guérin became one of the assistant secretaries. When the tendency was expelled from the SFIO (Royan Congress 1938), and the Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan was created, Guérin joined the new party, remaining firmly attached to the principles of revolutionary defeatism and proletarian internationalism.

He managed to return to France in 1942 and was involved in an underground Trotskyist organization.</p><p>For just over two years, 1946-9, Guérin lived in the USA, and on his return produced the two-volume study “Où va le peuple américain?” (Paris: Julliard, 1950 and 1951), parts of which were later republished as more specific studies on the American labour movement, the position of black Americans and economic concentration.</p><p>Throughout the 1950s Guérin was heavily involved in anticolonial agitation. In 1952 he travelled to the Maghreb and established contact with syndicalist and nationalist militants there. From 1953 to 1955 he was a member of the Comité France-Maghreb led by F. Mauriac. In 1960 he was one of the first signatories of the ‘Appeal of the 121’ calling for the right not to fight in the Algerian War, and in 1963 he presented a report to President Ben Bella on Algerian self-management After the coup of 1965, he helped found the committee which supported Ben Bella and opposed political repression in Algeria.

But being larger means an animal must take on complicated oxygen pumping and distributing systems to reach all the cells.” This idea has been referred to as “Haldane’s principle.”</p><p>Haldane was friends with the author Aldous Huxley, and was the basis for the biologist Shearwater in Huxley’s novel <em>Antic Hay</em>.

Harney was a member of the Communist Correspondence Committee set up in London. Harney and Jones met Marx in Paris in March 1848 after Marx’s expulsion from Belgium. The first English translation of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, was published in <em>The Red Republican</em> in 1850. Owing to proceedings taken against it under the Stamp Act, this paper changed its name to <em>The Friend of the People</em> in December 1850.

One of his tutors was the famous William Chillingworth. After several years spent travelling, and a period as a soldier in the Dutch army, he returned to England and lived quietly till 1646, when he was appointed to accompany King Charles I, who was being taken from Newcastle as a prisoner. Though republican in his ideas, Harrington won the king’s regard and esteem, and accompanied him to the Isle of Wight. He aroused the suspicion of the parliamentarians and was dismissed: it is said that he was punished for declining to swear to refuse assistance to the king should he attempt to escape.</p><p>After Charles’s death Harrington devoted his time to the composition of his <em>Oceana</em>, a work which pleased no one. By order of Oliver Cromwell, it was seized when passing through the press. Harrington, however managed to secure the favour of the Protector’s favourite daughter, Mrs Claypole; the work was restored to him, and appeared in 1656, dedicated to Cromwell. The views embodied in Oceana, particularly that bearing on vote by ballot and rotation of magistrates and legislators, Harrington and others (who in 1659 formed a club called the “Rota”) endeavoured to push practically, but with no success.</p><p>In November 1661, by order of Charles II, Harrington was arrested on a charge of conspiracy, and was thrown into the Tower of London. Despite his repeated request no public trial took place, and when at length his sisters obtained a writ of habeas corpus he was secretly moved to St Nicholas Island off Plymouth. There his health gave way owing to his drinking guaiacum on medical advice, and his mind appeared to be affected. Careful treatment restored him to bodily vigour, but his mind never wholly recovered. Some time after his release he married – the date does is not known.

His parents were poor and at the age of nine he began work down a mine in Winnemucca, Nevada. While working as a miner Haywood met Pat Reynolds, a member of the <a href="../../orgs/k/n.htm#knights-of-labor">Knights of Labor</a>. Reynolds was to have a lasting influence on Haywood’s political views.</p><p>In 1896 Haywood found work in the Blaine mine in Silver City, Idaho, and soon afterwards joined the <a href="../../orgs/w/e.htm#wfm">Western Federation of Miners</a> (WFM). Haywood became active in the union campaigns to increase wages and to bring an end to child labour in the mines. In 1901 Haywood was elected secretary-treasurer of the WFM. Later that year he joined the <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america">American Socialist Party</a>.</p><p>Haywood also edited the Miners’ Magazine, the journal of the WFM, and he used this position to promote the idea of socialism and argued that America should become a cooperative commonwealth. Other trade union leaders such as  <a href="../d/e.htm#debs-eugene">Eugene V. Debs</a> and <a href="../d/e.htm#de-leon-daniel">Daniel De Leon</a> were also converted to socialism.</p><p>Haywood and his political friends were unhappy with the conservative approach of the American Federation of Labor and on 27th June, 1905, they held a meeting in Chicago. Those who attended the meeting included Eugene V. Debs, Daniel De Leon, <a href="../j/o.htm#jones-mother">Mother Jones</a>, <a href="../p/a.htm#parsons-lucy">Lucy Parsons</a> and Charles Moyer. At the convention it was decided to form the radical labor organisation, the <a href="../../../history/usa/unions/iww/index.htm">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW).</p><p>In 1905 Haywood was charged with taking part in the murder of Frank R. Steunenberg, the former governor of Idaho. Steunenberg was much hated by the trade union movement after using federal troops to help break strikes during his period of office. Over a thousand trade unionists and their supporters were rounded up and kept in stockades without trial.</p><p>James McParland, from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, was called in to investigate the murder. McParland was convinced from the beginning that the leaders of the Western Federation of Miners had arranged the killing of Steunenberg. McParland arrested Harry Orchard, a stranger who had been staying at a local hotel. In his room they found dynamite and some wire.</p><p>McParland helped Orchard to write a confession that he had been a contract killer for the WFM, assuring him this would help him get a reduced sentence for the crime. In his statement, Orchard named Hayward and Charles Moyer (president of WFM). He also claimed that a union member from Caldwell, George Pettibone, had also been involved in the plot. These three men were arrested and were charged with the murder of Steunenberg.</p><p>Charles Darrow, a man who specialized in defending trade union leaders, was employed to defend Hayward, Moyer and Pettibone. The trial took place in Boise, the state capital. It emerged that Harry Orchard already had a motive for killing Steunenberg, blaming the governor of Idaho, for destroying his chances of making a fortune from a business he had started in the mining industry.</p><p>During the three month trial, the prosecutor was unable to present any information against Hayward, Moyer and Pettibone except for the testimony of Orchard and were all acquitted.</p><p>In 1908 the Wobblies, as they became known, split into two factions. The group headed by Eugene V. Debs advocated political action through the Socialist Party and the trade union movement, to attain its goals. The other faction, led by Haywood, believed that general strikes, boycotts and even sabotage were justified in order to achieve its objectives. Haywood’s views prevailed and Debs, and others who thought like him, left the organisation.</p><p>Haywood remained active in the Socialist Party and was seen as the leader of the radical left. Eventually, in 1912 Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit, the leaders of the right-wing, gained control and expelled Haywood and his followers.</p><p>In January 1912 the America Woolen Company reduced the wages of its workers. This caused a walk-out and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), who had been busy recruiting workers into the union, took control of the dispute. The IWW formed a strike committee with two representatives from each of the nationalities in the industry. It was decided to demand a 15 per cent increase in wages, double-time for overtime work and a 55 hour week.</p><p>Haywood, <a href="../t/r.htm#tresca">Carlo Tresca</a> and <a href="../f/l.htm#flynn-elizabeth-gurley">Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</a> now arrived in Lawrence and took over the running of the strike. On 12th March, 1912, the America Woolen Company acceded to all the strikers’ demands. By the end of the month, the rest of the other textile companies in Lawrence also agreed to pay the higher wages.</p><p>In 1913 Haywood and the Industrial Workers of the World helped organize the silk workers at the Paterson Silk Mills. During the dispute over 3,000 pickets were arrested, most of them received a 10 day sentence in local jails. Two workers were killed by private detectives hired by the mill workers. These men were arrested but were never brought to trial. However, the strike fund was unable to raise enough money and in July, 1913, the workers were starved into submission.</p><p>During the events <a href="../../events/w/o.htm#ww1">First World War</a> the Industrial Workers of the World opposed United States participation in the conflict. After United States entered the war in 1917, its leaders, including Haywood, were arrested under the Espionage Act. Haywood was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a fine of $30,000, however, released on bail during the appeal, Haywood fled to <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-government">Russia</a>.</p><p>In 1920, the <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international">Communist International</a> addressed an Open Letter to the IWW invited them to join the Comintern. Hayward said of this letter: ‘After I had finished reading it I called Ralph Chaplin and said to him: "Here is what we have been dreaming about; here is the IWW all feathered out!"’. Haywood went to the USSR to escape repression, "to end his days in the stuffy rooms of the Lux Hotel, among Marxists, not one of whom tried to understand him" (Serge).</p><p>The Russian government placed Haywood in charge of the Kuzbas coal-mining colony.

Nevertheless, of all the available logical material, it was the only piece which could be used, at least, as a starting-point. It had not been criticised, nor overcome; not one of the opponents of the great dialectician had been able to make a breach in its proud structure; it fell into oblivion, because the Hegelian school had not the slightest notion what to do with it.

Abstract and idealist though it was in form, yet the development of his thoughts always proceeded parallel with the development of world history and the latter is really meant to be only the test of the former. If, thereby, the real relation was inverted and stood on its head, nevertheless, the real content entered everywhere into the philosophy; all the more so since Hegel- in contrast to his disciples- did not parade ignorance, but was one of the finest intellects of all time. He was the first who attempted to show a development, an inner coherence, in history; and while today much in his philosophy of history may seem peculiar to us, yet the grandeur of his fundamental outlook is admirable even today, whether one makes comparison with his predecessors or, to be sure, with anyone who, since his time, has indulged n general reflections concerning history. Everywhere, in his <em>Phenomenlogy, Esthetics, History of Philosophy</em>, this magnificent conception of history prevails, and everywhere the material is treated historically, in a definite, even if abstractly distorted, interconnection with history.</p><p class="quote">"This epoch-making conception of history was the direct theoretical premise for the new materialist outlook, and this alone provide a connecting point for the logical method, too. Since this forgotten dialectics had lead to such results even from the standpoint of "pure thinking", and had, in addition, so easily settled accounts with all preceding logic and metaphysics, there must at any rate have been more to it than sophistry and hair-splitting. But the criticism of this method, which all official philosophy had fought shy of an still does, was no trifle.</p><p>Marx later wrote in his <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm" target="_top">preface to the second edition</a> of Capital (Volume 1):</p><p class="quote">"My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite.

Following Pauli to the University of Göttingen, he studied there under <a href="../b/o.htm#born-max">Max Born</a> and in 1924 went to study under Niels Bohr in Copenhagen.</p><p>Heisenberg was aware of growing problems with Boh\' model of the atom and wanted to develop a new model to cope with the growing contradictions.</p><p>In 1925, Heisenberg solved problem of how to account for the discrete energy states of an anharmonic oscillator which opened the way for an alternative explanation of the discrete energy levels founds in Boh\' model of the atom and a new interpretation of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg took as unobservable the supposed trajectory of a particle between its interactions in order to be able to construct a theory which deal only with the measurable interaction events. Consequently, physical variables would be represented by discrete <em>arrays</em> of numbers. Under the influence of <a href="../e/i.htm#einstein-albert">Albert Einstein</a>'s paper on relativity, he took the variables to represent only <em>measurable</em> quantities. Born showed that these arrays obeyed the rules of <em>matrix algebra</em>, and with Heisenberg, named the new quantum theory “matrix mechanics”. Each matrix specified the possible values for a physical variable, and the terms of a matrix were taken to generate probabilities of occurrences of states and transitions. Using the matrix mechanics to interpret the spectrum of the helium atom and other atomic and molecular spectra, ferromagnetic phenomena, and electromagnetic behaviour, Heisenberg demonstrated the validity of the conception experimentally.</p><p>In 1927, Heisenberg published the Indeterminacy, or Uncertainty, Principle in which he endeavoured to relate the matrix-entities to the intuitively familiar concepts of classical physics. If <em>q</em> is the position-coordinate of an electron, and <em>p</em> a measurement of its momentum, then delta-<em>q</em> * delta-<em>p</em> > <em>h</em> (Planc\' constant), where delta-<em>q</em> and delta-<em>p</em> are the standard deviation of measurements of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the characteristics of matrix algebra is that the <em>law of commutation for multiplication</em> does not hold (a*b not= b*a). Momentum and position are thus characterised as "non-commuting variables", from which it follows that the determination of each of the two variables cannot be deemed to make sense <em>independently</em> of one another, the two entities cannot have a separate meaning independent of one another; the Indeterminacy Principle stated above gives a definite quantitative measure to this degree of interdependence. This conception has a close parallel to Einstei\' discovery that measurements of space and time cannot be conceived of measuring entities <em>independent</em> of one another.</p><p>This result has been interpreted by subjectivist writers to mean that in some way what is at issue is the Mind of the person carrying out the measurement which is determining the interaction, but this idea hinges on a total misunderstanding of the issue. The problem for conception of these processes arises from the fact that for everyday, pictorial thinking, position and momentum are <em>distinct</em> entities; in relation to quantum phenomena, these concepts are meaningful only in relation to interactions of a particle, and quite distinct interactions are implied in the measurement of momentum or position. This is not at all the case in everday experience.</p><p>Initially, Heisenberg had arrived at the matrix-mechanics through the solution of mathematical problems and did not see the matrices as representations of particulate properties such as momentum and position. It was Bohr who showed how the Indeterminacy Principle expressed the relationship between the wave and particle conceptions of quantum phenomena and gave a quantitative expression to the Complementarity Principle.</p><p>Bohr and Heisenberg generalised the principle of complementarity to take account of a range of physical variables and the measurement process on which each depends. The principle and the difficulties which flow from its interpretation, was the subject of intense controversy among all the great physicists of that time, with Einstein, Schrödinger and Louis de Broglie all disputing Bohr and Heisenber\' interpretation of the principle of complementarity. </p><p>From 1927 to 1941 Heisenberg worked at the University of Leipzig and from 1941 to 1945 in Berlin. He never publicly opposed the Nazi regime and worked with Otto Hahn on the development of a nuclear reactor though he failed to develop an effective program for nuclear weapons. After the war he became director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics at Göttingen, moving with the institute to Munich.</p><p>After the War Heisenberg began work on spinors, complex vector-like representations, hoping to find universal symmetries in nature whcih would explain the wide variety of elementary particles.</p><p>Although he early, and indirectly, came under the influence of <a href="../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst">Ernst Mach</a>, Heisenberg, in his philosophical writings about quantum mechanics, vigorously opposed the Logical Positivism developed by philosophers of science of the <a href="../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle">Vienna Circle</a>. According to Heisenberg, what was revealed by active observation was not an absolute datum, but a theory-laden datum, contextualized by observational situations. He took classical mechanics and electromagnetics, which articulated the objective motions of bodies in space-time, to be permanently valid, though not applicable to quantum mechanical interactions; he took causality to apply in general not to individual quantum mechanical systems but to mathematical representations alone, since particle behaviour could be predicted only on the basis of probability. </p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em>See his <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heisenb2.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">History of Quantum Theory</span></a>.</p>')

Much of Helmholt\' later work was devoted to refuting the “Nature Philosophy” he had been taught by his father.</p><p>He attended the Friedrich Wilhelm Medical Institute in Berlin under the great physiologist, Johannes Müller, receiving a free medical education on the condition that he serve eight years as an army doctor. He also attended the lectures in physics and worked his way through higher mathematics from the textbooks, and taught himself the piano.</p><p>Shortly after graduating however, he was relieved from military duties and soon became assistant professor and director of the Physiological Institute in Königsberg and in 1855 was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn. More and more his interests moved towards physics, and in 1882 he was elevated to the nobility and in 1888, appointed director of the Physico-Technical Institute at Berlin, where he spent the remainder of his life.</p><p>One of the central interests of the latter part of the nineteenth century was investigation of the relationship between human beings and Nature by means of studying the physiology of perception. The majority of biologists of his day believed in the existence of a <em>life force</em> of some kind, inhabiting the bodies of living beings and responsible for their vitality. From an early age, Helmholtz set himself not only to dispense with this <em>vitalism</em>, but also to disprove <a href="../../people/k/a.htm#kant-immanuel">Immanuel Kant’s</a> idea of the <em>innate faculties</em> of Reason. Helmholtz insisted that <em>all</em> knowledge came through the senses, and he rejected all forms of deduction of natural law from philosophical considerations and conceptions of mystical “life forces.”</p><p>At the beginning of his career in Johannes Mülle\' laboratory, Helmholtz determined himself to tackle the problem of uncovering the physical and chemical processes at work in living organisms. His doctoral thesis on the connection between nerve fibres and nerve cells soon led him to the problem of explaining the generation of animal heat on the basis of basic physics and chemistry, intending in this way to absolutely refute the doctrines of vitalism, which held that body heat was derived from the action of the “life force.” His general considerations in preparing this work led to his formulation of the Law of Conservation of Energy (‘Force’ as he called it). His paper, published in 1847, marked an epoch in the history of natural science. In 1850, Helmholtz succeeded in measuring the speed of transmission of nerve impulses at 27 metres per second, an observation which contributed to undermining vitalism.</p><p>With painstakingly detailed investigation of the mechanisms of sight, and later studies of the sensations of audible tones, Helmholtz intended to undermine Kan\' conception of the innate comprehension of space and time, and he published a number of exemplary works on the physiology of sight and hearing.</p><p>Helmholtz showed exactly how the sense of vision created the idea of space. Space, according to Helmholtz, was a learned, not an inherent, concept. Moreover, Helmholtz also attacked Kan\' insistence that space was necessarily three-dimensional because that was how the mind had to conceive it. Using his considerable mathematical talents, he investigated the properties of non-Euclidean space and showed that these could be conceived and worked with as easily as the geometry of three dimensions.</p><p>Helmholt\' mathematical talents were exceptional. He attacked and solved equations that had long frustrated physicists and mathematicians. In 1858 he published the paper <span class="book">On the Integrals of Hydrodynamic Equations to Which Vortex Motions Conform</span>. This was not only a mathematical triumph, but also seemed to provide a key to the fundamental structure of matter. One of the consequences that flowed from Helmholt\' mathematical analysis was that vortices of an ideal fluid were amazingly stable; they could collide elastically with one another, intertwine to form complex knot-like structures, and undergo tensions and compressions, all without losing their identities. In 1866, Kelvin proposed that these vortices, if composed of the ether that was presumed to be the basis for optical, electrical, and magnetic phenomena, could act exactly like primeval atoms of solid matter. Thus the ether would become the only substance in the cosmos, and all physical phenomena could be accounted for in terms of its properties.</p><p>Helmholtz also did significant work on the mathematics of electrodynamics and spent his last years unsuccessfully trying to reduce all of electrodynamics to a minimum set of mathematical principles, an attempt in which he had to rely increasingly on the supposed mechanical properties of the ether.</p><p>In 1881, in a lecture delivered in London, Helmholtz argued for the particulate nature of electricity, leading to the coining of the word “electron”. Helmholtz came close to his goal of deducing all electromagnetic effects from properties of the ether, using his vortex hypothesis, and the discovery of radio waves by Hertz in 1888 was seen as confirmation of his theory. Ultimately, Helmholt\' theories were rendered obsolete by Einstei\' theory of special and general relativity, after which the concept of “ether” was abandoned.</p><p>Helmholt\' work was the end product of the development of classical mechanics. He pushed it as far as it could go. When Helmholtz died in Berlin in 1894, the world of physics was poised on the brink of revolution. The discovery of X rays, radioactivity, and relativity led to a new kind of physics in which Helmholt\'achievements, although impressive, had little to offer.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em>See his speech, <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/helmholt.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Facts of Perception</span></a>, summarising his epistemological views.</p>')

As a public figure, he achieved his greatest fame as master of Balliol College, Oxford, a post he held from 1965 until 1978. Yet it was as the defining Marxist historian of the century of revolution, the title of one of the most widely studied of his many books, that he became known to generations of students around the world. For all these, too, he will always be the master. </p><p>It would be a pardonable exaggeration to say that Hill created the way in which the people of late 20th-century Britain – and the left in particular – looked at the history of 17th-century England. As he never tired of pointing out, some of the themes he illuminated so richly had already been explored by left-wing scholars in the 1930s. But from 1940, when he published his tercentenary essay, <span class="book"><a href="../../../archive/hill-christopher/english-revolution/index.htm">The English Revolution 1640</a></span>, his own voluminously expanding and unfailingly literate work became the starting point of most subsequent interpretation, even for those who rejected his method and conclusions. </p><p>No historian of recent times was so synonymous with his period of study; he is the reason why most of us know anything about the 17th century at all. He was, EP Thompson once said, the dean and paragon of English historians. </p><p>Hill was born in York, where his father was a solicitor. His parents were Methodists, a fact to which he attributed his lifelong political and intellectual apostasy. Though his life was to be the embodiment of a secularised form of dissent, his high moral seriousness and egalitarianism surely had roots in this radical Protestant background. </p><p>At St Pete\' school in York, his academic prowess was immediately evident. It is said that, when Hill was 16, the two Balliol dons – Vivien Galbraith and Kenneth Bell – who marked his entrance papers agreed to award him 100%, before travelling to York to capture him for the college and prevent him going any further with a Cambridge application. Galbraith, in particular, was to remain an immense influence. </p><p>Hil\' association with Balliol was to continue, with only brief interruptions, from his arrival as an undergraduate in 1931 until his retirement as master 47 years later. Academic honours regularly fell his way, starting with the prestigious Lothian prize in 1932, and continuing with a first-class degree in 1934 and an All Souls fellowship that winter. But he was a successful rugby player too, the scorer of a famous cup-winning try for Balliol. Even more lastingly, he had become a Marxist. </p><p>Exactly when and why this happened is uncertain, since Hill was always notoriously inscrutable about discussing his personal life. He once claimed it came about through trying to make sense of the 17th-century metaphysical poets, but although he read Marx as an undergraduate, the moment of his conversion to communism is elusive. </p><p>His contemporary, RW Southern, once teasingly remembered “a time when Christopher was not in the least bit leftish", but Hill was an undergraduate during the period of the great depression, the hunger marches, the New Deal, Hitle\' rise (he visited the Weimar Republic before going up to Oxford), and the first (favourable) impact of Stalin in the west. He was a regular attender at GDH Col\' Thursday Lunch Club, where, as he once put it, “I was forced to ask questions about my own society which had previously not occurred to me.” </p><p>Certainly by the time he graduated, Hill had joined the Communist party. In 1935, he spent a year in the Soviet Union, during which he was very ill, but also formed a lasting affection for Russian life – and a somewhat less lasting one for Soviet politics. </p><p>After Moscow, he had two years as an assistant lecturer at University College, Cardiff, before returning to Balliol as a fellow and tutor in modern history. In 1940, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, before becoming a major in the intelligence corps and being seconded to the Foreign Office from 1943 until the end of the war. This was, to put it mildly, an intriguing period, about which he rarely let fall much detail. </p><p>By this time, he had begun to publish, at first pseudonymously, articles and reviews which, among other things, did much to draw attention to the burgeoning Soviet school of English 17th-century studies. Then, in 1940, arising out of intensive debate among a group of Marxist historians, who included Leslie Morton, Robin Page Arnot and – particularly influential on Hill – Dona Torr, came the decisive The English Revolution 1640. </p><p>The essay was originally published as one of a collection of three reflections (the others were by Margaret James and Edgell Rickword). Hil\' contribution, which was subsequently published alone, was a no-holds-barred assertion of the revolutionary nature of England between 1640 and 1660, and an assault on the traditional presentation of these years as an aberration in the stately continuity of English history. </p><p class="quoteb">“I wrote as a very angry young man, believing he was going to be killed in a world war,” Hill later told an interviewer. The book, he said, “was written very fast and in a good deal of anger, [and] was intended to be my last will and testament.” It has rarely, if ever, been out of print since. </p><p>The discussions surrounding Hil\' essay also produced, in 1946, the Communist Party Historians Group, an association he regarded as “the greatest single influence” on his subsequent work. This formidable academy, which included Edmund Dell, Maurice Dobb, Rodney Hilton, Eric Hobsbawm, James Jeffreys, Victor Kiernan, George Rudé, Raphael Samuel, John Saville and Dorothy Thompson, has a good claim to have redefined the study of history in Britain, especially after the launch, in 1952, of the journal <em>Past And Present</em>, of which Hill rapidly became the moving spirit and, later, the doyen. It also generated the path-breaking collection of documents, <em>The Good Old Cause</em>, that he edited with Dell in 1949. </p><p>The active, 20-year involvement with communism, which also led to his short biography, <em>Lenin And The Russian Revolution</em> (1947), came to a crisis after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Along with many in the CP, Hill had become disenchanted with the part\' lack of democracy and its reluctance to criticise the Soviet Union. Both issues came to a head in the late weeks of 1956, though his own break did not come until the following year. He was appointed to a CP review of inner-party democracy, but the rejection of the critical minority report, written by Hill (with Peter Cadogan and Malcolm MacEwen), precipitated his final departure. </p><p>These were watershed years in Hil\' personal life too. A wartime marriage to Inez Waugh, the former wife of a colleague, produced a home life which combined the high seriousness of Balliol Marxism with an extravagant bohemianism. It also produced their daughter Fanny Hill, later a dashing figure on the Oxford scene, who drowned off the Spanish coast in her 40s. The marriage collapsed early and, in 1956, he married again, this time to Bridget Sutton, then a history tutor with the Worker\'Educational Association in Staffordshire. Turbulence was replaced by the single greatest happiness of Hil\' life. With Bridget, he had a son and two daughters, one of whom died in a car accident. </p><p>After 1957, Hil\' career ascended to new heights as he began the remarkable output of books on which his reputation will rest, and which continued undiminished until he was well into his 80s. Hill always argued that the connection between leaving the CP and his wider fame was post-hoc rather than propter-hoc, and it is certainly true that 1956-57 caused no revolution (let alone a counter-revolution) in his analysis of the English revolution. On the other hand, the Bridget effect can hardly be underestimated. </p><p>If the steady flow of books which began with <em>Economic Problems Of The Church</em> (1955) can, to some extent, be seen as a succession of more scholarly explorations of the themes sketched out in the early didactic essays, they also reflect the extraordinary sweep of Hil\' interests and mind. Central to the whole project was a patient fascination with religion, represented, in particular, in his attempt to understand the revolutionary power of puritanism. </p><p>But Hil\' explorations were in no way bound by traditional or preconceived theories. The single, most striking and controversial aspect of his method was the way in which he subtly identified intellectual connections, currents and continuities between the most unlikely pieces of evidence – from scraps of court records to <em>Paradise Lost</em> and <em>Pilgri\' Progress</em>. His use of literary sources was one of his most fascinating characteristics. </p><p>Many of the tasks he set himself were laid out in his next book, <em>Puritanism And Revolution</em> (1958). They were further explored in <em>Society And Puritanism In Pre-Revolutionary England</em> (1964) and the remarkable <em>Intellectual Origins Of The English Revolution</em> (1965, and extensively revised 31 years later), this last based on his 1962 Ford lectures. Alongside came more popular works of exegesis – a Historical Association pamphlet on Cromwell (1958), the bestselling (but not adulatory) biography <em>Go\' Englishman</em> (1970), the textbook <em>The Century Of Revolution</em> (1961) and the hugely successful Penguin economic history, <em>Reformation To Industrial Revolution</em> (1967). </p><p>Those who heard Hill deliver the lectures on which it is based – lectures delivered in a nervous, slightly stuttering voice – will always reserve a special place for his 1972 study of radical and millenarian ideas, <em>The World Turned Upside Down</em>. Not only was this one of the very few history books to be turned into a play (at the National theatre), it was also a work made more exciting by the time in which it was written, an era of counter-cultural energy which Hill observed (and quietly celebrated) from the Balliol maste\' lodgings. </p><p>This was a period of immense academic daring (and, thought some, of over-reaching) as Hill scythed through received tradition in his study of <em>AntiChrist In 17th-century England</em> (1971) and his controversial study of <em>Milton And The English Revolution</em> (1977), which, like many of his later works, was written at the plain but lovely house in Périgord which Bridget badgered him into buying in 1969. </p><p>Meanwhile, in 1965, Hill had defeated Ronald Bell in the election for master of Balliol, a success which caused raised eyebrows (it was only 10 years or so since academics with Hil\' politics had been, to all intents and purposes, blacklisted from many posts) and much press attention. His tenure was deft and collegiate, and he tried to maintain his teaching and research amid the administrative and ceremonial duties. He never seriously hid his enthusiasm for the two main innovations of his mastership – the opening of male-only Balliol to women, and the representation of students on the college governing body. “Common sense varies among the young,” he admitted, “as among the old.” </p><p>Retirement found his productivity undiminished. He moved to Sibford Ferris, on the Cotswold hills, and, for two years, worked as a visiting professor at the Open University, an entirely characteristic effort to bring his learning to a wider audience. Then he settled down to further books: <em>Some Intellectual Consequences Of The English Revolution</em> (1980); <em>The World Of The Muggletonians</em> (1983); and <em>The Experience Of Defeat</em> (1984), an account of the Restoration made poignant by the reverses 20th-century leftwing politics were suffering at the time. </p><p>A marvellously vivid study of Bunyan followed in 1988, before <em>The English Bible In 17th-century England</em> (1993) and <em>Liberty Against The Law</em> (1996). Three volumes of essays were published in the 1980s – throughout his life, Hill wrote some of his most challenging and original work in articles and reviews. </p><p>Hill was honoured by an OUP festschrift, <em>Puritans And Revolutionaries</em>, when he retired from Balliol in 1978, and Verso published a series of tributes and criticisms, <em>Reviving The English Revolution</em>, 10 years later. Yet, for the last 20 years of his life, he became once again a more controversial figure. </p><p>His methodology was famously assaulted by JH Hexter in a Times Literary Supplement review in 1975, and his assessment of Milton was powerfully denounced by Blair Worden. A reaction against his big reading of 17th-century history took root in the work of Conrad Russell, John Morrill and others. Yet Morril\' tribute in 1989 – “If we can be sure that the 17th century changed England and Englishmen more than any other century bar the present one, we owe that recognition to him more than to any other scholar” – shows how, even in relative eclipse, Hill remained the central point of reference in 17th-century studies. </p><p>People always felt there was something enigmatic about Hill. Whether as a friend walking through Oxfordshire or the Dordogne, as a tutor hunched in his armchair discussing an essay – and still more on formal occasions – he kept his cards close to his chest, forcing you to do the talking, making you listen to what you were saying in the way that he was listening too. But then he would make a joke, often just a pointed ironic observation, that made you love him. As someone once said, although he affected to be severe, he could not help being benign. </p><p>But tough too. Always. Hill once gave a radio talk marking the centenary of the publication of <em>Das Kapital</em>. He ended it by telling how, in old age, Marx had bumped into a fellow revolutionary from the 1848 barricades, now prosperous and complacent. The acquaintance reflected that, as one got older, one became less radical and less political. “Do you?” Marx replied. “Do you? Well, I do not!” And nor, he clearly intended us to understand, did Christopher Hill. </p><p>From <em>The Guardian</em> (UK), February 26, 2003.</p>')
INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Hillquit, Morris (1869-1933)', 'glossary/people/h/pics/hillquit-morris-nywts.jpg', 'Morris Hillquit was a founder and leader of the Socialist Party of America, as well as a prominent labor lawyer in New York City’s Lower East Side during the early 20th century.</p><p>The future Morris Hillquit was born Moishe Hillkowitz in Riga, Latvia, on August 1, 1869, the second son of German-speaking Jewish factory owners.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> From the time he was 13, young Moishe attended a non-Jewish secular school, the Russian language Alexander gymnasium.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> At the age of 15, in 1884, Moishe’s father, Benjamin Hillkowitz, lost his factory in Riga and decided to leave for America to improve the family’s financial situation.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> In 1886, Benjamin sent for the rest of the family and they emigrated to the United States, settling in New York City.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> The family remained poor in the new world, living in a tenement in a predominately Jewish area of the lower East Side.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> In this period Moishe worked various short-term jobs in the New York city textile industry and as a picture frame maker in a factory.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup></p><p>Hillquit’s biographer Norma Fain Pratt remarks that Moishe was quickly drawn to the socialist movement in America:</p><p>Almost as soon as he settled in New York, Hillquit was drawn into East Side Jewish radical circles. He was then a small (5’4”), slightly built, frail adolescent with dark hair, dark oval-shaped eyes, and a gentle charming manner. He was immediately attracted to other young Jewish immigrants, mostly former students, now shop workers, who considered themselves intellectuals – a new radical <em>intelligentsia</em>.... For the most part their radicalism was rooted in their experiences in the European socialist and anarchist movements. But emigration and economic hardships in the United States also contributed to their further radicalization. As foreigners in America they were situated far enough outside the society to observe its failings. As frustrated but literate people, they were ambitious enough to participate in it. These young intellectuals were interested in finding alternatives to their present circumstances; their solution was to transform them.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n7">[7]</a></sup></p><p>On his 18th birthday in August 1887, the future Hillquit joined the Socialist Labor Party of America, brought into the ranks by a fellow garment worker and Russian language socialist newspaper editor, Louis Miller. Moishe became a member of Section New York’s Branch 17, a Russian-speaking unit established by Jewish emigrés from tsarist Russia not long before his joining.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n8">[8]</a></sup></p><p>Within a year or so of joining the SLP, biographer Pratt notes, Moishe Hillkowitz became one of the party’s leading crusaders against anarchism, publishing a lengthy article “Sotzializm un anarchizm” in the <em>Arbeter zeitung</em> [Workers’ News], a Yiddish newspaper that he helped to establish. Hillkowitz contrasted the individualism of anarchism with the communalism of socialism in this piece.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n9">[9]</a></sup> During this time the 19 year old HIllkowitz worked as the business manager of the <em>Arbeter zeitung,</em> a paper which was jointly founded with Abraham Cahan, Louis Miller, and Morris Winchevsky in an effort to speak to the city’s Yiddish-speaking immigrant working class about socialism in their own idiom.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n10">[10]</a></sup> Hillkowitz, ironically, was not fluent in Yiddish, having been raised with the German and Russian languages.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n11">[11]</a></sup></p><p>He helped to found the United Hebrew Trades, a garment workers’ union formed in 1888, while writing for the <em>Arbeiter Zeitung,</em> a Yiddish-language newspaper. He later graduated from New York University Law School in 1893.</p><p>Hillquit led the departure of a dissident faction from Daniel De Leon’s Socialist Labor Party in 1899, a group which united with the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of Victor Berger and Eugene V. Debs in 1901 to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). He remained a foremost political leader of that organization for the rest of his life, said to have espoused “the most popular brand of evolutionary Socialism within the Socialist Party."<sup class="enote"><a href="#n12">[12]</a></sup></p><p>In 1904, Hillquit attended the International Socialist Conference at Amsterdam and was involved in moving the proposed Anti-Immigration Resolution, which opposed any legislation which forbade or hindered the immigration of foreign working men, some of which were forced by misery to migrate. However, following “further consideration of the fact that workingmen of backward races (Chinese, Negroes, etc.) are often imported by capitalists to keep down the native workingmen by means of cheap labour, which constitutes a willing object of exploitation, lives in an ill-concealed state of slavery” as something which should be combatted by Social Democracy “with all its energy.” </p><p>Hillquit ran for US Congress in the New York 9th Congressional District in 1908, winning 21.23% of the vote in a losing effort against a Democratic incumbent.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n13">[13]</a></sup> After this campaign, Hillquit turned his attention to inner-party affairs. This brought him into conflict with the SPA’s syndicalist Left Wing. His biographer notes at least four serious points of departure between Hillquit and the Industrial Workers of the World wing of the party: (1) a disbelief in the stability and efficacy of industrial unions; (2) A distaste for the strike-oriented tactics of the IWW as opposed to collective bargaining; (3) A belief in the separation of functions between the political and labor wings of the workers’ movement, as opposed to the IWW’s desire to make industrial organization primary; and (4) The radical tone of IWW propaganda, which Hillquit believed served to alienate much of society from the socialist movement and marginalize the left.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n14">[14]</a></sup> His biographer declares that</p><p class="indentb">“His leadership fanned the fires of Party disagreement and although [Hillquit] was not alone in causing the break in 1913 with an important segment of its left wing, he certainly made a major contribution towards this unfortunate rupture."<sup class="enote"><a href="#n15">[15]</a></sup></p><p>In 1911, IWW leader William “Big Bill” Haywood was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City’s Cooper Union on Jan. 11, 1912. Haywood declared that Hillquit and the socialists ought to try “a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time” and attacked Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message rather than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. “A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists,” he declared.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n16">[16]</a></sup></p><p>Hillquit’s battle against the syndicalist left of the party continued at the 1912 National Convention, held in May in Indianapolis. Hillquit’s biographer notes that</p><p class="indentb">“As chairman of the Committee on Constitution he more than likely authored the amendment to the Party’s Article II, Section 6, which provided for the expulsion from the Party of ‘any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation....’” He voiced his justification for this anti-sabotage amendment by reassuring the convention that ‘if there is one thing in this country that can now check or disrupt the Socialist movement, it is not the capitalist class; it is not the Catholic Church; it is our own injudicious friends from within.’"<sup class="enote"><a href="#n17">[17]</a></sup></p><p>The issue of “syndicalism vs. socialism” was bitterly fought over the next two years, consumated by “Big Bill” Haywood’s recall from the SP’s NEC and the departure of a broad section of the left wing from the organization. The radical wing never forgave Hillquit for his anti-IWW orientation of these years and made him a major whipping boy in the big split that was to come.</p><p>As a staunch internationalist and antimilitarist, Hillquit represented the ideological center of the Socialist Party during the years of World War I, which controlled the organization in coalition with the more pragmatist right wing exemplified by such locally-oriented leaders, politicians, and journalists as Victor Berger, Daniel Hoan, John Spargo, and Charles Edward Russell. He was elected to the SP’s governing National Executive Committee on multiple occasions and was a frequent speaker at national conventions of the party. Due to his foreign birth, however, Hillquit was not constitutionally eligible to serve as President or Vice President of the United States and was thus never a candidate of the party for national office.</p><p>Hillquit was a principal co-author of the resolution against the United States’ entry into World War One which was passed overwhelmingly both by an emergency Socialist Party convention held just after the April 6th, 1917, U.S. declaration of war and by a subsequent membership referendum.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n18">[18]</a></sup> Despite official repression, popular patriotic pressure and vigilante action against the SP of A’s organization, members and press, Hillquit never wavered on the issue of intervention, staunchly backing Debs, Berger, Kate Richards O’Hare and other socialists charged under the Espionage Act for opposing the war effort.</p><p>On January 26, 1916, Hillquit was part of a three person delegation to President Wilson to advocate part of the Socialist Party’s peace program, which proposed that “the President of the United States convoke a congress of neutral nations, which shall offer mediation to the belligerents and remain in permanent session until the termination of the war.” A resolution to this effect had been offered in the House of Representatives by the SP’s lone Congressman, Meyer London of New York, and Wilson received Hillquit, London, and socialist trade unionist James H. Maurer at the White House, along with various other delegations. Hillquit later recalled that Wilson was at first “inclined to give us a short and perfunctory hearing” but as the Socialists made their case to him, the session “developed inot a serious and confidential conversation.” Wilson told the group that he had already considered a similar plan but chose not to put it into effect because he was not sure of its reception by other neutral nations. “The fact is,” Wilson claimed, “that the United States is the only important country that may be said to be neutral and disinterested. Practically all other neutral countries are in one way or another tied up with some belligerent power and dependent on it."<sup class="enote"><a href="#n19">[19]</a></sup></p><p>Beginning in June 1917, Hillquit served as chief defense lawyer in a series of high profile cases on behalf of various socialist magazines and newspapers. The Wilson administration, headed in the matter by Postmaster General Albert Burleson, began to systematically ban specific issues or entire publications from the mail, or to force publications into financial peril by denying them access to low cost periodical rates. Hillquit argued cases on behalf of a number of important radical publications, including Max Eastman’s radical artistic and literary magazine, <em>The Masses;</em> the two socialist dailies – the <em>New York Call</em> and the <em>Milwaukee Leader;</em> the SP’s official weekly, <em>The American Socialist;</em> the popular monthly <em>Pearson’s Magazine;</em> and the Yiddish language <em>Jewish Daily Forward.</em> In each of these cases, Hillquit argued that the socialist press was truly “American” and that a socialist definition of “patriotism” included the freedoms of press and speech and the right to criticize in a democratic society.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n20">[20]</a></sup> Hillquit was unsuccessful in winning access to the mails for the papers he represented, but he did manage to keep the proprietors of <em>The Masses</em> out of prison.</p><p>In the summer of 1917, with nationalism and pro-war sentiment sweeping the nation, Hillquit ran for Mayor of New York City. Hillquit’s campaign was based on an anti-war platform and commitment to economical public services and drew the diverse support both of committed socialists, pacifists and other anti-war activists, and pro-war liberals endorsing his campaign as a protest against the government’s “sedition” policy, which effectively served to curb freedoms of speech and press.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n21">[21]</a></sup> Hillquit seems to have been largely immune from attack by the Socialist Party’s left wing or other radicals during this high-profile campaign,<sup class="enote"><a href="#n22">[22]</a></sup> which ended with Hillquit collecting an impressive 22% of the citywide vote. This campaign, combined with the ongoing electoral success of Congressman Meyer London (elected as a Socialist in 1915, 1915, and 1921) marked the high point for Socialist Party politics in New York City.</p><p>As a member of the SP’s National Executive Committee Hillquit worked closely with National Secretary Adolph Germer and James Oneal to defend the party from what in modern parlance might be described as an “unfriendly takeover” by its revolutionary socialist left wing. However, due to ill health Hillquit did not participate in the pivotal 1919 Emergency National Convention at Chicago which formalized the split of the left wing from the Socialist Party to form the Communist Labor Party and the Communist Party of America. Instead, Hillquit was ensconced in a sanitorium in upstate New York, recovering from another bout of tuberculosis, and was informed about the events of the convention after the fact.</p><p>In 1920 Hillquit served as the lead attorney in the unsuccessful defense of the five democratically-elected Socialist assemblymen expelled from the New York State Assembly. Hillquit’s efforts to see Assemblymen Orr, Claessens, Waldman, DeWitt, and Solomon restored to office was ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>From 1922 through the election of 1924, Hillquit was a leading advocate of Socialist Party participation in the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA).</p><p>In 1932, shortly before his death from tuberculosis, Hillquit received over one-eighth of the vote in his second campaign for Mayor. This proved to be Hillquit’s final electoral run; during his life, he had been twice a candidate for Mayor of New York and on five times a nominee for Congress.</p><p>One of the buildings of the East River Housing Corporation, a housing cooperative started by the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union in Cooperative Village on the Lower East Side, was named in Hillquit’s honor.</p><p>Hillquit’s papers are housed at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin at Madison and are available on microfilm.</p><p>Hillquit was first and foremost an orator, delivering a torrent of public talks on socialist themes to various audiences throughout his life. In his memoirs, Hillquit conservatively estimates the total number of such speeches to have been “at least 2,000.” He often appeared in public debates taking up the socialist banner. He wrote frequently for popular magazines and the party press but fairly infrequently for publication in leaflet or pamphlet form. Despite the fact that Hillquit was not a prolific pamphleteer, he did author of a number of substantial books, including a serious academic history of socialism, <em>History of Socialism in the United States</em> (1903, revised 1910 – translated into both Russian and German); works of popularization, such as <em>Socialism in Theory and Practice</em> (1909) and <em>Socialism Summed Up</em> (1912); a short theoretical piece, <em>From Marx to Lenin</em> (1921); as well as a posthumously published memoir, <em>Loose Leaves from a Busy Life</em> (1934).</p><h5>Footnotes</h5><p class="information"><a name="n1"><span class="info">1.</span></a> Norma Fain Pratt, <em>Morris Hillquit: A Political History of an American Jewish Socialist.</em> Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1979; page 3.

The rest are derived from that original" (<a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hobbes.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Leviathan</span></a>). Memory and imagination are like the ripples which continue on after the initial distrubance has ended. While Hobbes points out that what is given in the senses is not equal to what is "pressing upon" the sense organs, he accepts that by means of sensation, we gain knowledge of the objects in the material world. [Interestingly, Hobbes accepts the Biblical story of God telling Adam the names of the animals, and speculates on how language develops from that beginning]. </p><p>He also advises that this knowledge will fall into error either due to inexperience, which can be corrected by further experience so long as the limitations of experience are attended to, or due to lack of adherence to formal logic in developing knowledge from the initial definitions of things. </p><p>Hobbes was 21 when Baco\' <span class="book">Natural History for the Building Up of Philosophy</span> was published in 1609, and Hobbes was in touch with Bacon from 1619 till Baco\' death in 1626.

He defended the social contract theory of Rousseau, but considered absolute monarchy the best form of state. His advocacy of the unrestricted character of state power was however appreciated by the birthing bourgeois class of the time.

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Hobsbawm, Eric (1917-2012)', 'glossary/people/h/pics/hobsbawm-eric.jpg', 'Hobsbawm was an important figure in Marxist history writing and Marxist historiography during the twentieth century. His series of books on the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries remains one of the great achievements in twentieth century historical work and historical scholarship. Hobsbawm was similarly one of the most important Marxist and Communist intellectuals of the twentieth century, producing varied and powerful research on history, the study of history and political affairs. He became a communist and a socialist in the early 1930s, as a teenager, having joined the Sozialistischer Schülerbund (Association of Socialist Pupils), a section of the Young Communist League of Germany, in Berlin in 1931. He subsequently joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1936 and remained a member until shortly before the dissolution of the CPGB in 1991. Hobsbawm remained a member of the CPGB despite the 1956 and 1968 Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Hobsbawm is still highly regarded in the profession of history, both as a researcher, writer, and teacher. </p><p>Politically, Hobsbawm was a loyal Communist for the majority of his adult life, having adopted socialism and communism in his teenage years, and retaining such politics until his death. He was loyal, yet critical, to the Soviet Union and the international Communist movement, especially after 1956 and the Hungarian Crisis. His politics were primarily shaped from his experiences during the Great Depression and in the struggle against Fascism during the 1930s. </p><p>As a historian, Hobsbawm produced a powerful series of major books on European history and world history between the years 1789 and 1991  the Age series  including Age of Revolution: 1789-1848, Age of Capital: 1848-1875, Age of Empire: 1875-1914, and Age of Extremes: 1914-1991. These studies essentially covered the origins and development of the modern capitalist world after the French Revolution and Industrial Revolution, the long nineteenth century, up to the end of the twentieth century. Alongside these were studies in labour history, the history of the socialist, communist and anarchist movements, books on primitive labour movements, bandits, nationalism, the invention of traditions, the historiography of the French Revolution, the history and politics of South America, and a book on Jazz (written under the pseudonym of Francis Newton  named after the 1930s communist trumpet player Frankie Newton). He also produced a book of autobiography, Interesting Times, which detailed his life and the events of his times. The book of autobiography is particularly significant as a memoir of a communist intellectual in the mid to late twentieth century. </p><p>Born in Egypt in June 1917 to a British father (Leopold Percy Hobsbaum) and an Austrian mother (Nelly Hobsbaum (née Grün)), Hobsbawm spent his childhood and early education in Vienna and Berlin. Following the death of his parents, the unemployment of the Great Depression, and the rise of Hitler and the Nazis in 1933, Hobsbawm emigrated with his aunt and uncle to the United Kingdom. He was educated in Vienna, Berlin, London and Cambridge. He graduated from Cambridge with a PhD in history (1947), on the Fabian Society, after military service in the Second World War. During the Second World War he served in the British Army, in the Royal Engineers and the Royal Army Educational Corps. From 1947 he taught history at Birkbeck College in London, retiring in 1982. Alongside this he also held teaching positions at the New School in New York and visiting Professorships at other Universities. He finished his academic career as President of Birkbeck, and as Emeritus Professor of economic and social history at Birkbeck, University of London. </p><p>Hobsbawm was also a member of the CPGB Historians Group  the history section of the British Communist Party, which helped to revolutionise the researching and writing of British history in the post-war years after 1945. Hobsbawm was also a founder member and editor of the historical journal  Past and Present. His contributing essay to the first volume of that journal in 1952, The Machine Breakers, a concise study of Luddism, remains a classic essay of labour history and working-class history. Hobsbawm contributed further essays to the journal  including essays on seventeenth century economic history ('The General Crisis of the European Economy in the 17th Century parts I and II), Political Shoemakers, The Social Function of the Past, on Peasant Land Occupations in Latin America and A Life in History. These were preceded and followed by extensive specialist essays on labour history and economic history, alongside significant contributions to social history, and historiography, during the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Amongst the Marxist historians of the CPGB history group, Hobsbawm was the most interested in global history and making connections across historical periods and areas of the globe. Alongside his comrades, C. Hill, E.P. Thompson, G. Rudé, R. Samuel, R. Hilton, V.G. Kiernan and others, Hobsbawms work changed the dynamics of how history was researched, written about and perceived. His historiographical impact was immense and continues to be immense  and not confined to simply historians of the Left. </p><p>As a specialist in labour history, Hobsbawm contributed heavily to the development of labour history as a powerful genre of historical research, particularly via the methods of history from below. This produced key studies of nineteenth and twentieth century labour movements, particularly those in Great Britain. Hobsbawm was also a specialist in primitive forms of working-class resistance in the early years of industrial capitalism  particularly Luddism, banditry, militant sects, labour sects, peasant/worker leagues in Sicily, Mafia, millenarians, nineteenth century anarchists, and city mobs. This speciality produced two key historical works  'Primitive Rebel\'and 'Bandits'. Hobsbawm similarly worked in the 1980s and 1990s, on the subject of invented traditions, the historical justification of social traditions, and the historical origins and historical consequences of nationalism. </p><p>Politically, Hobsbawm was a lifelong Communist, Socialist, Marxist and man of the Left, who wrote extensively on political and political historical matters, particularly the history and politics of the Left. After 1956, Hobsbawm refused to abandon the British Communist Party or his loyalty to the Soviet Union, but he developed friendly relations with the British New Left, and became a key intellectual influence on British Left politics after 1968. After 1956 he produced many key political essays which complemented his historical work. Many of these appeared in the key Left journals of the late twentieth century  from New Left Review to Marxism Today. Many of his political essays tended to focus on the contemporary problems of the British Left and International Left, alongside frequent discussions on Italian, French and South American Left politics. His 1978 essay The Forward March of Labour Halted?, while controversial, highlighted the difficulties that the British Left and International Left would face in the 1980s and during the era of neo-liberalism. Hobsbawms relationship with the USSR can be summarised as loyal yet critical  Hobsbawm remained loyal to the Soviet Union, but he frequently criticised its shortcomings and its betrayals after 1956. He particularly was critical of the crimes of Stalin and the Hungarian invasion of 1956. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the British Communist Party, Hobsbawm remained a man of the Left for the remainder of his life. He famously refused to renounce Marxism and the possibility of Socialism  while acknowledging the difficulties of Socialist politics after 1991. He still held out for the possibility of a socialist future for humanity. </p><p>Personally. Hobsbawm married twice. His first marriage, to Muriel Seaman, lasted from 1943 to 1951, ending in divorce. His second marriage, to Marlene Schwarz, in 1962, ended with his death in 2012. He had two children, Julia Hobsbawm and Andy Hobsbawm, from his second marriage. A third child, Joshua Bennathan, was born from an out of wedlock relationship with educational psychologist Marion Bennathan in 1958. As mentioned Hobsbawm wrote extensively on Jazz  producing both a book on the politics and history of Jazz, as well as Jazz reviews for the New Statesman. </p><p>Eric Hobsbawm died in London in October 2012, at the age of 95. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery, close to the grave of Marx. </p><p>  Selected Publications: Labours Turning Point (1948), Primitive Rebels (1959), The Jazz Scene (1959), The Age of Revolution (1962), Labouring Men (1964), Industry and Empire (1968), Bandits (1969), Capitan Swing (1969), Revolutionaries (1973), The Age of Capital (1975), The Invention of Tradition (1983), Worlds of Labour, (1984), Age of Empire (1989), Echoes of the Marseillaise (1990), Nations and Nationalism Since 1780 (1991), 'The Age of Extreme\'(1994), On History (1997), Uncommon People (1998), The New Century (2000), Interesting Times (2002), How to Change the World (2011), Fractured Times (2013), Viva la Revolucion (2016). </p>')

He is perhaps best remebered for his polemics with the post-Stalin leadership of the USSR and with Maoist China.       </p><p>Hoxha was a school teacher at the French lycée in Korcë until the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939, whereupon he was dismissed for refusing to join the newly-formed Albanian Fascist Party.  Hoxha then opened a tobacco shop in Tiranë, which, in time, became the center for a communist cell.   After the German invasion of Albania in 1941, Hoxha and other militants formed the Albanian Communist Party, which was later renamed the Party of Labor of Albania (PLA).  Hoxha was named secretary of the part\' Central Committee and political commissar for the Army of National Liberation, which fought against the German army and fascist and feudal Albanian forces.   From 1944 until 1954 he was Albani\' prime minister, and later held other posts in the government, but as secretary of the PL\' Central Committee, effectivel controlled the government until his death.</p><p>Following liberation from the Italian and German occupations, Albani\' society and economy were revolutionized.  The feudal relations which had remained from Ottoman rule were swept away and agriculture was collectivized, enabling Albania to eventually attain near-self sufficiency in food.  Simultaneously, industry, which had previously been almost nonexistent, grew to contribute more than 50% of the gross national product by the 1980s.   Electricity was brought to every rural district, epidemicdiseases were controlled, and illiteracy was made a thing of the past.</p><p>These gains, however, were accompanied by brutal Stalinist tactics. The PLA government imprisoned, executed, or exiled thousands of landowners, rural clan leaders, Muslim and Christian clerics, peasants who resisted collectivization, and party officials.   Hoxh\' social and economic policies, whicheven prohibited private ownership of automobiles, exercised a brake on Albani\' development and meant that in some areas collective agriculture was not even mechanized.   Despite gains in food production and industrialization, by the 1980s Albania was widely regarded as having the lowest standard of living Europe, but Hoxh\' isolationist policies left a populace so out of touch with the outside world that many thought that Albania was the most prosperous country in Europe.</p><p> In 1948 Hoxha broke relations with Yugoslavia and drew closer to the Soviet Union, and to Joseph Stalin, for whom he held a life-long admiration.   Indeed, after Stali\' death and Nikita Krushche\' "secret speech" denouncing him, Hoxha and the PLA broke with the Soviet Union and formed a bloc with the Communist Party of China in denouncing the post-Stalin USSR as "revisionist" and "social-imperialist" . (See, for example, his speech at the Meeting of 81 Communist Parties in Moscow in 1960, <a href="../../../reference/archive/hoxha/works/nov1960.htm" target="_top">"Reject the Revisionist Theses of the XX Congress of the CPSU and the Anti-Marxist Stand of Krushche\' Group! Uphold Marxism-Leninism!"</a>.)</p><p>However, Hoxh\' relations with the Maoists were not entirely smooth.  For one thing they had differing notions of "protracted peopl\' war."   Mao and his followers world-wide insisted that in peasant countries urban insurrection must occur in the last stages of the revolutionary war, which until then would have the countryside as its theater of operations.  Hoxha insisted, on the other hand, that the cities ought not to be left until last but that actions must be carried out simultaneously in city and countryside.    As revolutionary movements gathered momentum in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, continents with large rural populations, these issues were at the center of intense debates between "Hoxhaists" and Maoists.  </p><p>Relations grew further strained as the cult of personality around Mao grew, China drew closer to the United States and other capitalist countries, and as Chin\' stature and influence increased internationally.   Eventually, Hoxha broke with that country in 1978 after the death of Mao Zedong and Chin\' rapprochement with the West.  In that year he published <a href="../../../reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm" target="_top"><em>Imperialism and the Revolution</em></a>, in which he declared that Mao Zedong was not a Marxist-Leninist and that there were no Marxist-Leninists in China.  From then on, Hoxh\' Albania turned in on itself as Hoxha, having alienated every ally and worker\'government, declared that Albania not only would become a model socialist republic on its own, but that it was the only socialist country left in the world.</p><p>Hoxha retired from active politics in 1981, but not without carrying out a final purge in which the several leading party members and government officials were executed.   The reins of government were handed to Hoxh\' protegé, Ramiz Alia, who suceeded him upon his death in 1985.</p><p class="fst"><em>See:</em> <strong><a href="../../../reference/archive/hoxha/index.htm" target="_top">Hoxha Reference Archive</a></strong></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../h.htm">Index of the Letter H</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

He then studied physics, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy at the universities of Leipzig, Berlin, and Vienna. In Vienna he received his PhD in 1882 with a dissertation entitled <span class="book">Contributions to the Theory of the Calculus of Variations</span>. In the autumn of 1883, Husserl moved to Vienna to study with <a href="../../people/b/r.htm#brentano-franz">Franz Brentano</a>.</p><p>Husserl received a decisive impetus from Brentano and his circle of students where the spirit of the Enlightenment, with its religious tolerance and its quest for a rational philosophy, was very much alive. Husser\' striving for a more strictly rational foundation found its corroboration here. Such a foundation meant for him not only a theoretical act but the moral meaning of responsibility in the sense of ethical autonomy. In Vienna Husserl converted to the Evangelical Lutheran faith, and one year later, in 1887, he married Malvine Steinschneider, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher from Prossnitz, who was to be his indispensable support in life. </p><p>In 1886 Husserl went to Carl Stumpf, the oldest of Brentan\' students, who was professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Halle. In 1887 Husserl qualified as a lecturer in the university. He had become a close friend of Stumpf, and was indebted to Stumpf for many suggestions in the formation of his own descriptive concepts. The theme of Husser\' thesis, <span class="book">On the Concept of Number: Psychological Analyses</span>, already showed Husserl in the transition from his mathematical research to a reflection on a psychological source for the basic concepts of mathematics. These investigations were an earlier draft of his <span class="book">Philosophy of Arithmetic</span> which appeared in 1891. </p><p>The title of his inaugural lecture in Halle was <span class="book">On the Goals and Problems of Metaphysics</span>. In the traditional sense metaphysics is the study of Being. Though the text is lost, it is clear that Husserl already understood his method of the analysis of consciousness to be the way to a new universal philosophy and metaphysics, which he hoped would displace all previous schemes. </p><p>The years of his teaching in Halle (1887-1901) were later seen by Husserl to have been his most difficult. He often doubted his ability as a philosopher and believed he would have to give up his occupation. The problem of uniting a psychological analysis of consciousness with a philosophical grounding of formal mathematics and logic seemed insoluble. But from this crisis there emerged the conviction that the philosophical grounding of logic and mathematics must commence with an analysis of the experience that lies before all formal thinking. Husserl made an intensive study of the <a href="../../terms/e/m.htm#empiricism">British Empiricists</a>, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and <a href="../../people/m/i.htm#mill-john-stuart">J S Mill</a>, and the logic and semantics stemming from this tradition, especially the logic of Mill, and studied the attempts at a "psycho-logic" grounding of logic then being made in Germany. </p><p>The fruits of this work were presented in the <span class="book">Logical Investigations</span> (1900-01), which employed a method of analysis that Husserl now designated as "phenomenological." After the publication of the <span class="book">Logical Investigations</span>, Husserl was called, at the instigation of <a href="../h/i.htm#hilbert-david">David Hilbert</a> to the University of Göttingen. Husser\' time of teaching in Göttingen, from 1901 to 1916, was important as the source of the Phenomenological movement. </p><p>The phenomenological analysis of experienced reality - i.e., of reality as it immediately presents itself to consciousness - drew not only the German students who were unsatisfied with the Neo-Kantianism that then prevailed in Germany but also many young foreign philosophers who came from the traditions of Empiricism and <a href="../../terms/p/r.htm#pragmatism">Pragmatism</a>. From about 1905, Husser\' students formed themselves into a group with a common style of life and work. Standing in close personal contact with their teacher, they always spoke of him as the "master". </p><p>Husserl himself had developed an individual style of working: all of his thoughts were conceived in writing, and during his life he produced more than 40,000 pages. </p><p>Husserl was still at Göttingen when Max Scheler, who was at that time a lecturer in Jena and who later became an important Phenomenologist, came in contact with Husserl (1910-11). Husser\' friendship with <a href="../../people/d/i.htm#dilthey-wilhelm">Wilhelm Dilthey</a>, also falls within this period. Husserl later acknowledged that his encounter with Dilthey had turned his attention to the historical life out of which all of the sciences originated and that, in so doing, it had opened for him the dimension of history as the foundation of every theory of knowledge. </p><p>In the Göttingen years, Husserl drafted the outline of Phenomenology as a universal philosophical science. Its fundamental methodological principle was what Husserl called the phenomenological reduction. It focuses the philosophe\' attention on uninterpreted basic experience and the quest, thereby, for the essences of things. In this sense, it is "eidetic" reduction. On the other hand, it is also the reflection on the functions by which essences become conscious. As such, the reduction reveals the ego for which everything has meaning. Hence, Phenomenology took on the character of a new style of transcendental philosophy, which repeats and improves Kan\' mediation between Empiricism and Rationalism in a new way. Husserl presented its program and its systematic outline in the <span class="book">Ideas; General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology</span> (1913). With this work, Husserl wanted to give his students a manual. The result, however, was just the opposite: most of his students took Husser\' turn to transcendental philosophy as a lapse back into the old system of thought and rejected it. With the onset of the war, the phenomenological school fell apart. </p><p>In 1916 he was appointed Professor at the University of Freiburg. His inaugural lecture on <span class="book">Pure Phenomenology, Its Area of Research and Its Method</span> circumscribed a new program of work. He had understood the War as the collapse of the old European world, in which spiritual culture, science, and philosophy had held an incontestable position. After this, his reflections were directed with special emphasis upon philosoph\' task in the renewal of life. </p><p>He continued his attempt to clarify the relation between psychological and phenomenological analysis of consciousness and considered the grounding of logic in the <span class="book">Formal and Transcendental Logic</span> (1929). </p><p>In this last period of his life, Husser\' teaching assumed a different style from that at Göttingen. It did not lead to the founding of a new school and assumed more the character of a monologue. Nevertheless, numerous foreign guests usually took part in his seminar, and <a href="../../people/c/a.htm#carnap-rudolph">Rudolf Carnap</a>, a leading figure in the <a href="../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle">Vienna Circle</a>, also studied under Husserl. </p><p>Lectures at the University of Amsterdam and later at the Sorbonne furnished the occasion for a new systematic presentation of Phenomenology, <span class="book">Méditations cartésiennes</span>. </p><p>When he retired in 1928, <a href="../../people/h/e.htm#heidegger-martin">Martin Heidegger</a>, who was to become a leading <a href="../../terms/e/x.htm#existentialism">Existentialist</a>, became his successor. Husserl had looked upon him as his legitimate heir. Only later did he see that Heidegge\' chief work, <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heidegg2.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Being and Time</span></a> (1927), had given Phenomenology a turn that would lead down an entirely different path, and their relationship cooled after 1930. </p><p>On Hitle\' seizure of power in 1933, Husserl was excluded from the university; but he received numerous visits by foreign philosophers and scholars. Condemned to silence in Germany, he received, in the spring of 1935, an invitation to address the Cultural Society in Vienna. There he spoke freely for two and one-half hours on <span class="book">Philosophy in the Crisis of European Mankind</span> and repeated the lecture two days later. </p><p>Husserl also addressed the University in Prague in the fall of 1935, after which many discussions took place in the smaller circles.

Jung proposed and developed the concepts of the extroverted and introverted personality and archetypes which have been influential in psychiatry and are the basis of the Myer-Briggs Personality types. Drawing on concepts from astrology and mythology, Jung introduced the idea of the Collective Unconscious, wherein figures repeatedly appearing in dreams, myths etc., are supposed to have a substantial, non-material reality, and Jung openly declared himself a philosophical idealist.</p><p>The son of a pastor, Jung had a lonely childhood and from an early age was observing his fathe\' failing belief in religion and the difficulties of the other adults around him.

Jung coined the term <em>complex</em> to refer to these clusters of associations and the psychological condition behind them. </p><p>These researches gave Jung an international reputation, and from 1907 Jung collaborated closely with Freud, leaving the Institute to set up his own practice in Zurich in 1909, while continuing to lecture at the University of Zurich. Jun\' findings confirmed many of Freu\' ideas, and he was widely thought of as the most likely successor to Freud. However, like very many others in the years to follow, Jung did not share Freu\' obsessive and exclusive focus on sexuality as the root of psychosis and this soon lead to an acrimonious split. Jun\' <span class="book">Psychology of the Unconscious</span> established his international standing, and Jung resigned from Freu\' International Psychoanalytic Society in 1914. </p><p>One of the difficulties in appreciating Jun\' achievement is that he focussed his work very much on the study of patients with extreme personality disorders; however, the mental structures that Jung was describing are equally characteristic of normal mentality. The most widely known of these structures was his identification of the <em>Extroverted</em> (outward-looking) and <em>Introverted</em> (inward-looking) personality types. Later he described four functions of the mind – Thinking and Feeling, the different ways in which people evaluate situations (“decision instruments”), and Sensing and Intuition, the different ways in which people organise their conception of the world. In any given person, one or the other of these functions will predominate over the other. Jung presented these ideas in his 1921 <span class="book">Psychological Types</span>, the first modern theory of personality.</p><p>The other aspect of Jun\' work which has been very influential is his approach to the analysis of dreams. After his break with Freud, Jung made an extensive study of his own dreams, taking extensive notes as soon as he awoke. Jung identified numbers of particularly vivid images, which he began to see were to be found not only in his dreams, but appeared in Mythology, and Religion across the ages, as well as being commonly reported by other people in their dreams. He coined the term <em>Archetypes</em> for these images – instinctive, universal images and associated behaviour patterns, and ascribed their appearance in the individua\' mind to a <em>Collective Unconscious</em>, shared by everyone.</p><p>This linking of individual psychological experiences with belief patterns found throughout history led Jung to a study of the history of religion and social beliefs which was to be his main focus for the remainder of his life.</p><p>In later years he became Professor of Psychology at the Federal Polytechnical University in Zürich (1933-41) and Professor of Medical Psychology at the University of Basel (1943). Jun\' belief that Germany held a special position in Europe, a view he was not shy to express in public, led to his being wrongly branded as a Nazi sympathiser.

In philosophy he was the founder of  the "Critical Philosophy"; immediate precursor of Hegel. Kant confronted the problem posed by <a href="../../people/h/u.htm#hume-david">Hume</a> showing that if knowledge could only be derived from experience, then in fact there could be no knowledge of a world "beyond sensation" - and yet positive knowledge clearly did exist. In studying the forms of cognition and its limits, Kant developed a philosophy riddled with contradictions which provided the material upon which Hegel was able to build. Kant held that "things-in-themselves" (beyond sensation) were in principle unknowable - only "phenomena" are knowable. Showing that opposite propositions about the nature of reality can be proved, Kant held that these contradictions are only "seeming" and knowledge of "things-in-themselves" is accessible only by Faith.

His father, Johann Kautsky, was a painter and his mother, Minna Jaich Kautsky, a novelist and actress whose novels were admired by Engels. The family moved to Vienna when he was seven years old and after the elite Vienna Gymnasium (Grammar School) he attended the University of Vienna in 1874, joining the Austrian Social Democratic party in 1875 and working as a journalist for them. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in Zurich who were supported financially by Karl Höchberg and who smuggled socialist material into the Reich at the time of the Anti-Socialist Laws. Influenced by <a href="../b/e.htm#eduard-bernstein">Eduard Bernstein</a>, Höchberg’s secretary, he became a Marxist and in 1881 visited Marx and Engels in England.</p><p>In 1883 he founded the monthly <em><a href="../../periodicals/d/i.htm#die-neue-zeit">Die Neue Zeit</a></em> in Stuttgart which became a weekly in 1890 and was its editor until 1917. The journal became immensely influential intellectually in socialist circles both in Germany and internationally. From 1885 to 1890 he worked with Engels in London and while there he published <em>Karl Marx’ ökonomische Lehren</em>, later translated in 1925 as <em>The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx</em> which was probably the most widely read Marxist work on economics among <a href="../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp">SDP</a> activists. It was so influential that long after Lenin had denounced him as a renegade it was still being used at the Moscow Lenin School in 1931 as by far the best treatment of the subject. Unfortunately his work on the French Revolution, <em>Die Klassengegensätze von 1789</em> (1889, 2nd ed. 1908), written at the same time, has never been translated into English.</p><p>He went back to Vienna in 1890 where he married his second wife Luise Ronsperger (1864-1944) who was later to die in Auschwitz and, after the repeal of the German Anti-Socialist Law, they went to live in Stuttgart. His draft of the SPD programme, approved by Engels, was accepted at the Erfurt Congress in 1891 and became another of his highly influential publications and at least three different translations into English were made of it. He started to develop a Socialist agrarian programme. His main work on this, <em>The Agrarian Question</em>, has only been recently translated (1998) and is still in copyright so not available here on the MIA. After the death of Engels, to whom he was closer than he had been to Marx, he wrote a warm tribute to him.</p><p>In 1896 he polemicised with <a href="../../../archive/bax/index.htm" target="_top">Belfort Bax</a> on the Marxist conception of history and in 1897 moved with his family to Berlin and in a series of articles in his paper called for participation of the SPD in the Prussian elections despite the disgracefully undemocratic constitution. The electoral process could be used a tribune to raise the consciousness of the workers and recruit them to socialism. In 1898 he took up the question of colonialism and the nationalities question in Austria. On colonialism he was one of the first Marxists to see its importance and to take an intransigent stand against it. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position in the later 1890s, later translated as <a href="../../../reference/archive/bernstein/works/1899/evsoc/index.htm" target="_top"><em>Evolutionary Socialism</em></a> (1908) Kautsky denounced him in articles and in an important book, <em>Bernstein und das sozialdemokratische Programm</em>, Stuttgart, 1899. Again there is no English translation of this very important work though there is a French one, <em>Le Marxisme et son critique Bernstein</em>. Kautsky correctly perceived that Bernstein’s emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the “progressive” bourgoisie and a non-class approach though in fact Bernstein’s approach to colonial questions would not strike many people today as excessively ethical. Kautsky thus appeared as the intellectual leader of the revolutionary left wing of the SPD though the growth of the Trade Union fraction was making the party more and more inclined to reformism. However it takes two to tango and the Imperial and Prussian governments showed not the slightest inclination to yield to democratic pressure from an opposition with the mildest of demands. In that situation it was possible for Kautsky to maintain his revolutionary credentials since there was little prospect of a viable reformist current in Wilhemine Germany. Above all Kautsky was opposed to non-working class alliances in the Imperial German situation.</p><p>In 1901 he handed over his ownership of <em>Die Neue Zeit</em> to the SPD while remaining editor. As an internationalist he opposed Socialist support for foreign tariffs and protection which he felt was at the expense of working class living standards. The SPD was less successful in influencing the Catholic than the Protestant working class and so he analysed the reactionary policies of the Catholic Church. In 1904 and 1905, under the influence of Russian events, Kautsky, although far more cautious than Rosa Luxemburg, argued against the SPD right wing that the whole question of the mass strike should be studied and not dismissed. However he never advocated such a mass strike in any specific situation – his demand that it should be considered as an option remained quite abstract though in theory he advocated a joint parliamentary and direct action approach in the Imperial German state to press for democratic reforms with the proviso that such action should have a good chance of success. At the Congress of the <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-international">Second International</a> at Stuttgart in 1907 he successfully attacked the pro-colonialist faction. <em>The Foundations of Christianity</em> was written in 1908. <em>Der Weg zur Macht</em>, (1909) translated as <a href="../../../archive/kautsky/1909/power/index.htm"><em>The Road To Power</em></a>, and praised by Lenin, is sometimes thought to be his most “revolutionary” work. There is a poorer older version but an excellent new translation by Meyer (1996) exists which it is still in copyright and is available in many libraries.</p><p>Up to the outbreak of World War One, in addition to writing on themes already mentioned, he dealt with new questions such as anti-Semitism and inflation as well as articles on Finance Capital, Imperialism and national rivalries together with improved scholarly editions of Marx. His theories on imperialism, for over time his position changed, differed somewhat from that of Lenin. In particular he did not seem to believe that imperialism would drive to war, rather he saw it as a reactionary social phenomenon which appealed to the decaying class of the aristocracy and some marginal capitalist ones and was doomed. Only a fraction of the great mass of articles that he had written up to this point were translated into English and since many of the analyses were brilliant, even if he had much less to say on tactics, they deserve to be made available to a larger international audience as only through the medium of English can the largest number of people be reached today.</p><p>In 1914 the crisis struck and war was declared. At the meeting of the Reichstag caucus on 3 August 1914 which decided to vote for the war credits next day, Kautsky, not a member of the Reichstag himself, stated that the character of the war could not be determined, and therefore the right to defence of the fatherland had to apply to all countries involved in the war. He wanted the Party to demand from the government an assurance that it wanted no conquests, and if the government agreed the war credits should be approved, if not, not. This course of action was clearly utopian. He was utterly unprepared for the horror as he had increasingly tended to believe, as his pre-war theories of “Ultra Imperialism” suggest, that capitalism was sufficiently rational not to go to war. In June 1915, about ten months the war had began and when it had become obvious that this was going to be long sustained and appallingly costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Bernstein and Haase against the right and denounced the government’s annexationist aims. The SPD was dominated by its pro-war and Trade Union wing and tried to muzzle him so eventually Kautsky reluctantly split in 1917 and, together with Bernstein and Haase, joined the USPD as its right wing. In June 1917, after the first revolution in Russia he stated that this should lead to democracy but not to socialism since Russia was too undeveloped economically so Socialism would have to wait. In September 1917 the SPD dismissed him as editor of <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>. By this time he was becoming a more marginal figure as the “storm of the world” was crushing the SPD “centre” and strengthening the left of Luxemburg and Liebknecht. The collapse of the Imperial state in 1918 through military defeat and immense working class privation threw up a real revolutionary situation for which he was quite unprepared theoretically.</p><p>Soon after the <a href="../../events/o/c.htm#october">Bolshevik revolution</a> he denounced, in the <em><a href="../../../archive/kautsky/1918/dictprole/index.htm" target="_top">The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</a></em> (1918), all attempts to bring socialism forcibly to backward societies like Russia but he served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short lived SPD-USPD government revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany (<em>Die Deutschen dokumente zum Kriegsausbruch</em> ..., 1919, <em>The Guilt of Wilhelm Hohenzollern</em>, also 1919). In response to Lenin’s accusations of being a renegade he wrote <a href="../../../archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/index.htm" target="_top"><em>Terrorism and Communism</em></a> in 1919.</p><p>After 1919 he became steadily less important. He visited Georgia in 1920 and wrote a book in 1921 on this Social Democratic country still independent of Soviet Russia and in 1920, when the USPD split, with a minority of that party he went back into the SPD. At the age of 70 he moved back to Vienna with his family in 1924 where he remained until 1938. In that period he continued his scholarship on the letters of Engels and his criticisms of Soviet Russia seeing that country as doomed by its inherent backwardness. He wrote something on <a href="../../terms/f/a.htm#fascism">Fascism</a> after 1933 but he was also critical of the workers rising against Dollfuss in Vienna in 1934 but published his views anonymously and thus wrote about the Nazis in 1934 that “we should guard against overestimating the superiority of Hitler’s power” and that when capitalist democracy is threatened “we do not in any way regard ourselves as driven to the necessity of answering the destruction of democracy by an armed insurrection.”</p><p>In 1938 he fled to Czechoslovakia at the time of Hitler’s Anschluss, and thence by plane to Amsterdam where he died in the same year.

The early history of Bloomsbury, that exclusive circle of the cultural elect, which counted among its members Leonard and Virginia Woolf, the painter Duncan Grant, and the art critic Clive Bell, centres upon Cambridge and the figure of Lytton Strachey. </p><p>After graduating from Cambridge, Keynes became a civil servant and moved to the India Office in Whitehall. His experience there formed the basis of his first major work, which is still the definitive examination of pre-World War I Indian finance and currency. He then returned to Cambridge, where he taught economics with great success until 1915. The onset of World War I brought him back to government employment, where he was daily concerned with the economic management of the war. </p><p>Accompanying Lloyd George to the Versailles Peace Conference as an economic adviser, Keynes soon became so distressed at the political chicaneries of the proceedings and the unrealistic character of the reparations policies to be imposed upon a defeated Germany that his health deteriorated, and he resigned his post. </p><p>He composed the indictment of the Versailles settlement that by Christmas 1919 reached the bookstores as <span class="book">The Economic Consequences of the Peace</span>. The permanent importance of this polemical essay lies in its economic analysis of the excessive weight of reparations upon the German economy and the improbability that they ever would be paid. </p><p>In Cambridge, to which Keynes now returned, he was esteemed as the most brilliant student of Alfred Marshall and A.C. Pigou, the two eminent Cambridge economists.

In this way he sought to overcome Humean scepticism by the assertion that theoretcially grounded hypotheses need only be shown to have finite probability to form the basis of science and rational action. </p><p>Keynes’ epistemology began from the British idealist utilitarian G. E. Moore, "in which universals originate and exist only in the mind; and although a concept may be chosen by reason and art to describe a collection of imperfectly similar units, nevertheless, that concept cannot be assumed to exist in real life. ...Platonic metaphysics was ... manifested in the <span class="book">Treatise</span> as the doctrine of rational intuition, ... our state of knowledge of practical affairs is not sufficient, except in trivial instances, ... but we can anticipate the future by seeing, in an artistic but rational way, that there is a pattern to the facts. ... Nevertheless, his world of elusive change is not consistent with utilitarianism, and Keynes criticised that doctrine repeatedly and without a word of qualification. Not only did the <span class="book">Treatise</span> deny that there is any generally predictable connection between an action and its outcome, but even where the consequences were known, Keynes’ ethics advocated ’being good’ rather than ’doing good’ ... Keynes referred to this doctrine as a logic of motives rather than of consequences." [from <span class="book">The significance of Keynes’ Idealism</span>, Athol Fitzgibbons] </p><p>In 1925 he opposed England’s return to the gold standard at the pre-war dollar-pound ratio of $4.86; and, long before the Great Depression, supported the Liberal Party’s program of public works to take the unemployed off welfare. But respectable economists still relied upon the expected automatic adjustments of the free market. Since Keynes could not yet offer a theoretical refutation of his colleagues’ opinions, his agitation for public works had little political effect. </p><p>As a journalist he extended his reputation, writing in the <em>New Statesman</em>, <em>The Times</em> and the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>. </p><p>In the United States Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 landslide presidential victory over Herbert Hoover attested to the political bankruptcy of laissez-faire as an antedote to the Great Depression. Keynes’ enduring triumph was his composition in the early 1930s of the most influential treatise composed by an economist thus far in this century, comparable to Adam Smith’s <span class="book">Wealth of Nations</span> and Malthus’ <span class="book">Essay on Population</span>. The <span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/index.htm" target="_top">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a></span>, which appeared in 1935-36, is a highly technical, even abstruse exposition of new ideas that had been partly foreshadowed in his <span class="book">Treatise on Money</span> (1930).The central message is that in a depression, there was no wage so low that it could eliminate unemployment. Accordingly, it was wicked to blame the unemployed for their plight and explained the origins of unemployment and depression by aggregate demand - i.e., the total spending of consumers, business investors, and public agencies. When aggregate demand was low, sales and jobs suffered. When it was high, all was well. </p><p>From these generalities there flowed a powerful and comprehensive view of economic behaviour. Because consumers were limited in their spending by the size of their incomes, they were not the source of business cycle fluctuations. The dynamic actors were business investors and governments. In depressions the thing to do was either to enlarge private investment or to create public substitutes for private investment deficiencies. In mild economic contractions, monetary policy in the shape of easier credit and lower interest rates just might stimulate business investment and restore the aggregate demand caused by full employment. Severer contractions required as therapy the sterner remedy of deliberate public deficits either in the shape of public works or subsidies to afflicted groups. </p><p>During World War II and after, one Western country after another affirmed its new commitment to maintain high employment. </p><p>The <span class="book">General Theory</span> was Keynes’s last major written work. In 1937 he suffered a severe heart attack. Two years later, though not completely recovered, he returned to teaching at Cambridge, wrote three influential articles on war finance entitled <span class="book">How to Pay for the War</span>, and served once more in the Treasury as an all-purpose adviser. As the war drew to a victorious conclusion, Keynes turned his thoughts to the design of international financial institutions calculated to limit the spread of depression. At the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 he played a prominent part. But the institutions that resulted from the conference, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - two agencies that survive into the 1980s - bear much stronger marks of the orthodox theories of the United States Treasury of that time than of Keynes’s thinking. </p><p>His last major public service was his brilliant negotiation in the autumn and early winter of 1945 of a multibillion-dollar loan granted by the United States to England. He was now both a member of the Court of the Bank of England and, as Lord Keynes of Tilton, a peer of the realm.

(1913-2009)', 'undefined', '<p>British Marxist historian, who specialised in world history and the history of Empire, alongside historical interests in numerous areas of history, politics and literature. </p><p>Victor Gordon Kiernan, was a British Marxist historian, known for his general studies of the history of Imperialism, Empire and World History. Kiernan was an excellent general historian, who wrote on numerous historical areas and on numerous historical subjects, particularly in intellectual history and political history. His work covered the history of Empire, but also ancient history, Horace, Urdu poetry, Shakespeare, Religion, Methodism and the French Revolution, the Spanish Revolution of 1854, the social struggles of the seventeenth-century, mercenaries, the history of armies, elites in history, British diplomacy, British diplomatic history in China and India, tobacco, the history of the United States, the history of Great Britain, and the history of European Empires in the nineteenth-century and twentieth-century. A committed and life-long Marxist and socialist, Kiernan was an outstanding figure among British left-wing historians in the twentieth-century. </p><p>Professionally, Kiernan was a writer and a historian, teaching history in India between 1938 and 1946, and at the University of Edinburgh from 1948 until his retirement in 1977. As a historian he was a generalist but specialised in the history of Empire and the history of the World after 1500.</p><p>Kiernan was born in Ashton-on-Mersey, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1913. His parents came from a religious and non-conformist background. His father, John Edward Kiernan, was a translator for the Manchester Ship Canal, specialising in Spanish and Portuguese.  Kiernan was educated at Manchester Grammar School. An excellent student of Classics and Languages, Kiernan won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he completed his tertiary education, gaining a double-starred First in History (B.A.,1934; M.A., 1937). </p><p>Following his education, Kiernan travelled to India in 1938, to teach at the Sikh National College and Aitchison College in Lahore, India (now Pakistan). He returned to Britain in 1946. In  1948, Kiernan was appointed to a teaching post in history at the University of Edinburgh. In 1970, Kiernan was made Professor of Modern History at Edinburgh. He retired in 1977. </p><p>Politically, Kiernan was a Socialist, a Communist and a Marxist. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1934, over the  struggle against Fascism, the nature of the Great Depression and his belief that Britain’s capitalist elites had betrayed the interests of Britain’s working poor in the Depression years and been weak and cowardly in failing to properly confront Fascism in Europe.  During his time in India, Kiernan remained involved in Party work, particularly in delivering messages from the CPGB and the Comintern to the Communist Party of India, and in establishing Marxist study groups among Indian students.  Kiernan remained in the CPGB until 1959, when he left over his lingering disgust over the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Despite this Kiernan remained a Marxist and a socialist. </p><p>During his membership of the CPGB, Kiernan was heavily involved in the Communist Party Historians Group – a group of CPGB members interested in history and historical discussion. Kiernan was a vital and energetic member of the group from 1946  until 1959.  During his time in the CPGB, over 25 years, he was a well-liked and respected member, especially by the other historians in the CPGB.  E.J. Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson  and Rodney Hilton, all noted Kiernan as among the best of the British Marxist historians produced by the twentieth-century.  After leaving the CPGB, Kiernan was heavily involved in left-wing historical groups and debates.</p><p>Kiernan was a very prolific historian. His first two books, published in 1939, were studies of British diplomacy in China during the first half of the 1880s (<em>The Dragon and St. George</em> and <em>British Diplomacy in China, 1880 to 1885</em>). These were followed up by numerous other books, articles, essays and historical reviews, across his long and prolific career. A key work of his, which appeared in 1969, was  <em>Lords of Human Kind</em>, a study of European Empires from 1500 to 1914 and their impact on social relations in the world, particularly European attitudes towards the rest of the World.  In this book Kiernan charted the impact of capitalism and imperialism on the modern world, particularly on the development of modern racism and modern social structures. The book, a classic since publication, has gone on to be a defining book of historical studies of the European Empires of the nineteenth-century. Kiernan’s work on Empire famously de-constructed the economic and social basis of Imperialism to show its disastrous effects on the modern world.  Other key works by Kiernan included a study of European duellists and duelling (<em>The Duel in European History</em>), a short history of the United States and U.S. Imperialism (<em>America: From White Settlement to World Hegemony</em>), biographies of Horace and Shakespeare (<em>Horace:Poetics and Politics</em>,  <em>Shakespeare: Poet and Citizen</em>), multiple studies of Western Imperialism (<em>Marxism and Imperialism: Studies</em>,  <em>European empires from conquest to collapse, 1815-1960</em>, and <em>Imperialism and its contradictions) </em>and a history of Tobacco <em>(Tobacco: A History). </em>As stated most of Kiernan’s work involved historical subjects after 1500 and after the establishment of European overseas Empires after 1492.</p><p>Kiernan was also heavily involved in the founding of the left-wing Historical Journal <em>Past and Present</em>. In the first issue he contributed a ground-breaking study of the role of Methodism in Great Britain during the period of the French Revolution of 1789-1815 (<em>Evangelicalism and the French Revolution</em>). From this he contributed numerous other articles and essays to the journal, including studies of Mercenaries in late Feudal Societies (<em>Foreign Mercenaries and Absolute Monarchy</em>), and a study of seventeenth-century European societies (<em>State and Nation in Western Europe</em>). Kiernan also published extensively on historical and political subjects in the <em>New Left Review</em> and the <em>Socialist Register</em>.  Many of these essays dealt with the later history of Imperialism and Colonialism, and the final falls of the Spanish, Portuguese, and British Empires. </p><p>Kiernan’s historical work is primarily known for its breadth and his extensive historical interests. His writing style combined the best of the Marxist approach to history with the best of the British literary tradition. Kiernan’s work was not limited by historical period or historical genre. He was a genuine master of all areas of history and historical research.</p><p>Kiernan’s most pioneering work was primarily in the area of European Imperialism and European Empires in the nineteenth-century. His classic study of the social relationships in the European Empires, <em>Lords of Human Kind</em> (1969), remains a classic historical study of both the origins and impacts of European Imperialism and European Empire. <em>Lords of Human Kind</em> remains his most well-known work.</p><p>Kiernan was also a committed literary scholar and was an expert in Urdu poetry. Kiernan was particularly familiar with the poetry of  Ghalib (1796-1869),  Iqbal (1877-1938), and Faiz (1911-1984), some of the most important Poets to emerge from the Indian sub-continent. In his career Kiernan produced ground-breaking translations of the poems of both Iqbal and Faiz; which helped to popularise both writers among readers in the West and to expand literary interest in the West for the Indian sub-continent. Kiernan was a great proponent of the idea that good literature belonged to the whole of humanity, and was not simply limited to the Western canon.</p><p>Kiernan’s career as a historian was one of the most productive and most wide-ranging  in the historical profession. His work is still highly regarded as some of the finest produced in the Marxist tradition and his studies of Empire and Imperialism, especially, have yet to be rivalled.  He remained committed to the ideals of socialism.</p><p>In his private life Kiernan was married twice. His first marriage, to the Indian dancer Shanta Gandhi,  lasted from 1938 to 1946, and ended in divorce. His second marriage: to the Canadian scholar Heather Massey,  lasted from 1984 until his death in 2009. <p>Kiernan died at his home in Stow, Scotland, on the 17th February 2009. He was aged 95.</p><p>Selected Publications: <em>The Dragon and St. George: Anglo-Chinese relations 1880-1885</em> (1939), <em>British Diplomacy in China, 1880 to 1885</em> (1939), <em>Poems from Iqbal, Translation</em> (1955), <em>The Revolution of 1854 in Spanish History</em> (1966), <em>The Lords of Human Kind.

His parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his grandmother until he was seven when he was sent to an orphanage.</p><p>At the Kazan Technical School he became a Marxist and joined the Social Democratic Party in 1904. He took part in the 1905 Revolution in St. Petersburg. He was arrested but was released after three months in prison. </p><p>Kirov now joined the Bolshevik faction of the Social Democratic Party. He lived in Tomsk where he was involved in the printing of revolutionary literature. He also helped to organize a successful strike of railway workers. </p><p>In 1906 Kirov moved to Moscow but he was soon arrested for printing illegal literature. Several of his comrades were executed but he was sentenced to three years in prison. The prison had a good library and during his stay he took the opportunity to improve his education.</p><p>Kirov returned to revolutionary activity after his release and in 1915 he was once again arrested for printing illegal literature. After a year in custody he moved to the Caucasus where he stayed until the abdication of Nicholas II in March, 1917. </p><p>After the October Revolution Kirov was sent to fight the anti-Bolshevik forces in the Caucasus. He fought in the Red Army until the defeat of General Anton Denikin in 1920.</p><p>In 1921 Kirov was put in charge of the Azerbaijan party organization and the following year helped organize the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.</p><p>Kirov loyally supported Joseph Stalin and in 1926 he was rewarded by being appointed head of the Leningrad party organization. He joined the Politburo in 1930 and now one of the leading figures in the party, and many felt that he was being groomed for the future leadership of the party by Stalin.</p><p>In the summer of 1932 Joseph Stalin became aware that opposition to his policies were growing. Some party members were publicly criticizing Stalin and calling for the readmission of Leon Trotsky to the party. When the issue was discussed at the Politburo, Stalin demanded that the critics should be arrested and executed. Kirov, who up to this time had been a staunch Stalinist, argued against this policy. When the vote was taken, the majority of the Politburo supported Kirov against Stalin. </p><p>In the spring of 1934 Kirov put forward a policy of reconciliation. He argued that people should be released from prison who had opposed the governmen\' policy on collective farms and industrialization. Once again, Joseph Stalin found himself in a minority in the Politburo. </p><p>After years of arranging for the removal of his opponents from the party, Joseph Stalin realized he still could not rely on the total support of the people whom he had replaced them with. Stalin no doubt began to wonder if Kirov was willing to wait for his mentor to die before becoming leader of the party. Stalin was particularly concerned by Kiro\' willingness to argue with him in public. He feared that this would undermine his authority in the party.</p><p>As usual, that summer Kirov and Joseph Stalin went on holiday together. Stalin, who treated Kirov like a son, used this opportunity to try to persuade him to remain loyal to his leadership. Stalin asked him to leave Leningrad to join him in Moscow. Stalin wanted Kirov in a place where he could keep a close eye on him. When Kirov refused, Stalin knew he had lost control over his protégé.</p><p>Sergei Kirov was assassinated by a young party member, Leonid Nikolayev, on 1st December, 1934. Stalin claimed that Nikolayev was part of a larger conspiracy led by Leon Trotsky against the Soviet government. This resulted in the arrest and execution of Genrikh Yagoda, Lev Kamenev, Gregory Zinoviev, and fourteen other party members who had been critical of Stalin.</p><p>In <em>The Granat Encyclopaedia of the Russian Revolution</em> Kirov wrote:</p><p class="quoteb">The prison library was quite satisfactory, and in addition one was able to receive all the legal writings of the time. The only hindrances to study were the savage sentences of courts as a result of which tens of people were hanged. On many a night the solitary block of the Tomsk country prison echoed with condemned men shouting heart-rending farewells to life and their comrades as they were led away to execution. But in general, it was immeasurably easier to study in prison than as an underground militant at liberty. </p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/">Spartacus Schoolnet</a>.</p>')

Kolchak was was admired by the aristocracy and bourgeoisie alike for possessing the “romantic" traits of chivalry and duty to the King above all else, as the servant of god.</p><p> As a young officer Kolchak had taken part in the dangerous Arctic explorations, and had fought with great bravery in the defense of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese war.  After the defeat of the Russian Navy, he led a small group of officers who reorganized the leading brass of Russi\' Navy. His thorough and efficient work over the next decade were awarded with a promotion to Rear-Admiral at the very young age of 43.  By June 1916, when he was forty-four years old, Kolchak was appointed Vice-Admiral in command of the Black Sea Fleet, where he received acclaim for courage and efficiency in setting minefields close to Turkish shores.</p><p>When the Soviets grew in strength after the <a href="../../events/f/e.htm#february-revolution-1917">February Revolution</a>, Kolchak refused to remain in the Navy and shortly emigrated to the United States and England.  He returned to Russia after the <a href="../../events/o/c.htm#october-revolution-1917">October Revolution</a>, landing in the Far Eastern Siberian port of Vladivostok.  Kolchak publicly proclaimed his full support of England in its efforts to overthrow the Soviet government and was assigned to coordinate the military maneuvers of the various interventionist forces in the region. Ataman Semenov, also operating in the region, ignored Kolchak as did the Japanese.  Kolchak was undeterred, and set plans to gain command of the <a href="../../orgs/w/h.htm#white-army"> White Army</a> in the Don region, but as he reached Omsk he was persuaded to join the newly established White government ("the directory") as Minister of War.  Shortly after his joining, on November 18 1918, while visiting the soldiers at the front, his czarist comrades overthrew the directory and appointed Kolchak supreme ruler and commander-in-chief, establishing an autocratic military dictatorship.</p><p>Landlords, accompanied by soldiers, took from the Siberian peasants what they had “seized for themselves".  In factories, factory owne\' returned with soldiers to forcibly remove worker\'ownership of the factories.  Untold numbers of workers and peasants were shot, beaten, raped, and imprisoned.  All political factions who opposed Kolcha\' dictatorship were imprisoned, including the right-wing of the Socialist revolutionary party, who at one time had been a part of the directory.</p><p>The peasantry and workers of Omsk revolted on Dec. 21, 1918, outraged by the brutality of Kolchak and his overthrow of the directory.  A number of imprisoned right-wing Socialist revolutionaries were successfully liberated by the revolting population. To suppress the revolt, Kolchak ordered soldiers to open fire, killing over 300 unarmed civilians.  The people were successfully dispersed.  In the weeks following 166 civilians were shot dead for having ties to instigating the revolt.  The Socialist revolutionaries, who had been freed from imprisonment, gave themselves up in fear of reprisals.  They were promptly taken to the banks of the Irtysh River, and shot.</p><p>Kolcha\' military campaign was no less brutal. In late December 1918 a section of the Siberian Army, led by General Gajda under the command of Kolchak, marched westward over the Ural mountains and captured the city of Perm. The Red Army responded by a heroic crossing of the Volga River, liberating the towns of Ufa and Orenburg (directly south of Perm).</p><p>Kolchak then unleashed a full offensive into southern Russia from Perm.  His 40,000 strong Western Army pushed back the Soviet 5th Army which held the city of Ufa, with less than 10,000 men and women in its defense.  After months of courageous fighting, the Soviet 5th Army was forced to fall back, and on March 13 Kolcha\' Army occupied Ufa.  In the following weeks Kolchak continued to drive his armies farther into the heart of Russia, separating them to capture the two major ports on the Volga River: Kazan, 450 kilometers northwest of Ufa, and Samara (later renamed Kuybyshev), 400 kilometers southwest of Ufa.  In the North, the remnants of Kolcha\' Northern Siberian Army left Perm and marched west, towards the large industrial city of Vyatka (later renamed Kirov), some 400 kilometers to the west.  If successful, Kolchak would establish a strong Eastern front, and would only have to rely on his British collaborators in the North, the French in the South West, and Denikin in the South to ensure the strangulation of the Soviet government from the peoples of Russia.</p><p>Kolcha\' advances, however, were halted not only by the Red Army, but also by the Russian peasantry who would not tolerate Kolcha\' brutality.  As most of his forces were now West of the Urals, his dictatorship in Siberia began to crumble. While his officers in Siberia continued their brutal suppression of the peasantry, the soldiers under their command refused to carry out orders.  The supply lines to Kolchak soldiers in the West began to falter, and their morale began its steady decline, with soldiers defecting to the Red Army everyday.</p><p>By the end of April, the Red Army began its counteroffensive.  Led by Mikhail Frunze, Kolcha\' Western Army slowly began to fall back.  By June 9, the city of Ufa was liberated again, and Kolcha\' armies were forced to flee east of the Ural mountains. The Red Army was relentless.  Kolcha\' forces had bordered themselves up in the city of Chelyabinsk, but they could not withstand the force of the Red Army.  By November 14, 1919, almost a year to the day that Kolchak had established a military  dictatorship in Omsk, the Red Army, with the help of the revolting peasantry and the soldiers under Kolcha\' command, liberated the city of Omsk.  </p><p>In January, 1920, Kolchak proclaimed Denikin his successor as leader of the white armies.  Kolchak retreated east, attempting to flee Russia through Vladivostok, but was killed by the Red Army.  </p>')

On returning to Russia he joined the Bolshevik party in 1918 and was part of the bloc known as the Left Communists. ‘Left Communism had numerous adherents within the party’ writes Sam Oppenheim. This faction which included Preobrazhensky, Bukharin, Kollontai, Obolensky [Osinsky], Pyatakov and many other Bolsheviks wanted immediate, full nationalisation and workers’ control, were strong supporters of planning, and were especially strongly represented in the regional and local economic councils known as the sovnarkhozy.</p><p>Although Kritsman is today mainly known for his studies of the countryside, he also wrote a major study of the economy of ‘War Communism’ which Serge complained remained untranslated in any European language as late as 1930, describing the book as ‘a remarkable economic analysis’. (In fact, a German translation had appeared in 1929.) This work was called <i>The Heroic Period of the Great Russian Revolution</i>. Extracts from the German translation suggest a strong liking for hegelian terminology (as with Rubin’s work).</p><p>In the main part of the 1920s he occupied various leading academic positions, including that of Professor of Economics at Moscow University. Under NEP and as a member of the Communist Academy, he pioneered a remarkable school of agrarian research which came to be known as the ‘Agrarian Marxists’. This dedicated itself to field studies of the renewed emergence of capitalism among Russian peasant households, using what he and his colleagues saw as more rigorously Marxist criteria of class differentiation. This aspect of Kritsman’s work later became the subject of a superb monograph by Terry Cox called Peasants, Class, and Capitalism (1986).</p><p>K. believed that in a planned economy there were no ‘objective laws’. For him ‘mass creativity was the basic characteristic of communism’. He described the famous November 1917 decree on workers’ control as ‘half-measures, therefore unrealisable’. What he meant by this was that it did not go far enough in enabling workers to start the process of managing enterprises as opposed to simply supervising existing capitalist managements. ‘It [the decree] was the implied expression of a weakness, still to be overcome, of the working class movement.’ Osinsky, another Left Communist, wrote that the workers’ control slogan ‘failed when it sought to convert itself into a system’.

This ancient internationalist prefers to see the psychology of a defeated nation on the other side of the border.

He exclaimed: "Are we going to live through the same thing? Not by any means!" He was applauded by the entire hall. And then what rainbow prospects, he said, are opened by the war: "All are beginning to understand that we must build a new life on new socialist principles. . . . Lloyd George is making speeches imbued with the socialist spirit. . . . In England, in France and in Italy, there is forming a new comprehension of life, imbued with socialism-unfortunately state socialism." If Lloyd George and Poincare have not yet "unfortunately" renounced the state principle, at least Kropotkin has come over to it frankly enough. "I think," he said, "that we will not be depriving the Constituent Assembly of any of its rights-I fully recognize that to it belongs the sovereign decision upon such questions-if we, the Council of the Russian land, loudly express our desire that Russia should be declared a republic." Kropotkin insisted upon a confederative republic: "We need a federation such as they have in the United States." That is what Bakuni\' federation of free communes had come down to! "Let us promise each other at last," adjured Kropotkin in conclusion, "that we will no longer be divided into the left and right halves of this theater. . We all have one fatherland, and for her we ought all to stand together, or to lie down together if need be, both Lefts and Rights."

In a conception which is strongly reminiscent of Hegel’s conception of the development of knowledge, he argued that scientific research always works within a certain “paradigm,” or closed system of concepts and methods which exclude dissident views which cannot be fitted into the system. During such a period of ‘normality’, researchers simply refine theories and develop their implicaitons; puzzling or anomalous results or facts are simply excluded. Over time, however, the weight of these anomalies builds up and eventually trigger a crisis in which attention is suddenly turned to what was previously ignored, basic assumptions and long-held opinions are overthrown and eventually some new way forward emerges and the old system of ideas falls into disrepute and the whole science is again reworked under the new “paradigm”.</p><p>Kuhn was a part of a widespread movement interested in Cognitive Science in the post-World War Two period.

He studied Hegelian philosophy at the University of Naples under Bertrando Spaventa, who saw in the new Italian State the realization of the Hegelian ideal. Spaventa’s brothers Bertrando and Silvio were also typical exponents of the historical right, liberal but not democratic.</p><p>Labriola’s first published work was a critique of Zeller (a teacher of Greek philosophy at the University of Heidelberg), clearly inspired by Bertrando Spaventa’s Hegelianism. After studying under A. Tari, F. De Sanctis and B. Spaventa at the University of Naples, Labriola abandoned orthodox Hegelianism, writing in 1869 a sharp criticism of the Hegelian A. Vera’s <em>Lectures on the Philosophy of the History</em>.</p><p>Between 1870 and 1874 (before the fall of the Right), Labriola wrote for liberal political journals, such as <em>Gazzetta di Napoli</em>, <em>Il Piccolo</em>, <em>L‘Unità Nazionale</em> and <em>Monitore di Bologna</em>. From these articles one can already notice Labriola’s concern to study in a concrete way the needs of the popular masses, particularly national education, understood as intellectual and moral reform, a topic that is found again and again in his philosophical writings of this period (<em>The Origin and nature of the passions in the Ethics of Spinoza</em> of 1866, the <em>The Doctrine of Socrates according to Senofonte, Platone and Aristotle</em> of 1871, the <em>On Moral freedom and the Morality of Religion</em>, both of 1873). In 1874 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy and Pedagogy at the University of Rome. Subsequently he lectured on philosophy, philosophy of history and pedagogy.</p><p>Labriola progressively modified his ideas, separating Hegel’s historicism from his idealism, especially thanks to the ethical psychology of Johann Friedrich Herbart. State, religion and school became for Labriola the means to realise a progressive political strategy.</p><p>Towards the second half of the 1880s, responding to the spontaneous People’s Movement which had grown up around the figure of Garibaldi, and then around Bakunin, Labriola began to move more and more to the left, convinced that a completely democratic revolution was possible only if it first of all went to the defence of the working masses (for Labriola, the urban working class). At first he was attracted to radicals like Clevises, then to Socialists like Turati. Labriola came see that the State was more and more captive of a decadent and corrupt bourgeoisie. Between 1880 to 1886 he lectured on the State, its origins and its functions. Progressively the idea matured in his mind that the true motive force of history is to be found in the political movement of the popular masses. That is in the society rather than in the state.</p><p>During the period 1887 to 1890, he looked towards a process of democratic transformation of the State and civil society setting out from the Commune. He became convinced that “radical Jacobinism”, excluding the collective involvement of the broadest layers of society, in reality favoured just the radical elite. In short, he elaborated a strategy for building a base for social democracy that had as its characteristic element involvement in local government, rather than focussing on achieving popular self-government. In order to understand this phase of his thought, see <em>Problems of the Philosophy of History and Socialism</em> (1889).</p><p>Around 1890 he began to study the works of Marx and Engels and became convinced that in the modern world the most creative and revolutionary force is the working class Socialist movement. He entered into an intense correspondence with the leading exponents of European Socialism: Engels, Kautsky, Bernstein, Georges Sorel. He considered German Social Democracy to be a model for Italy, although he considered Italy to be a more backward nation. He was the main organiser of the May Day demonstrations in Rome in 1891. His <em>Essays on Historical Materialism</em> was not only the first work of Marxism to be written in Italy, but established Labriola as one of the greater European Marxist theorists of that time. The main feature of this work was its opposition to “Neo-Kantian Marxism": proposing a choice between “ethical Marxism” and “scientific Marxism,” Labriola did not have doubts in preferring the second.</p><p>Labriola addressed himself to Turati, calling for the promotion of a true left-wing, proletarian socialism. Turati was the Socialist leader in the most modern city of Italy, Milan, and the editor of “Critica sociale” which began publication in 1891. The differences between the two were remarkable: Labriola wanted a small, homogenous, combative, Marxist party of workers; Turati wanted instead a broad party open to heterogenous elements, pragmatic and reformist. At the founding conference of  the party in Genoa in 1892, Turati responded to Labriola, in removing the anarchistic elements, but the program remained eclectic. However, Labriola succeeded in convincing Turati to engage the party in the defense of the Sicialian <em>movimento dei Fasci</em>. At this time the contrast between manufacturer-agrarian bloc of the dominant classes and opposition bloc of workers and peasants was not yet clearly delineated in the countryside. However in the party, because of its own theoretical ambiguities (“social-positivist,” Labriola would say), three opposing currents would very soon develop.</p><p>It was for this reason that Labriola preferred to dedicate himself to theoretical studies, without tying himself to the organization. In his last years he was engaged in a debate which ignited on the legacy of Marxism, on its infuence in philosophy and on political strategy. Labriola saw in this debate much the same differences as he had earlier analysed in the comparison of Bernstein and Sorel and of Gentile and Croce. He died in 1904, but in 1927-28 his <em>Letters to Engels</em> were published.</p><p>His major works are:</p><p class="indentb">a) <em>In memory of “Communist Manifesto”</em> (1895), in which he asserts that <em>The Manifesto</em> has the form of a forecast, based on a genetic examination of the general crisis of nineteenth-century capitalism. Labriola preferred to use the term “genetic Marxism” rather than “dialectics” because “the dialectic,” was such a misused word, it could provide an opening through which some travesty of metaphysics could re-enter; On the other hand, he never spoke about “Scientific Socialism,” but always about “Critical Communism,” because of the danger of Positivism;</p><p class="indentb">b) <em>On historical materialism</em> (1896), in which he criticised the reduction of historical materialism to an abstract schema to be applied to reality, without taking account of the interdependence of the relationship of base to superstructure. History, Labriola said, providing the basis of Gramsci’s future reflections, can be understood as a complex social organism: it is impossible to understand it by studying economic processes alone, but requires also the study of social psychology;</p><p class="indentb">c) <em>Correspondence on Philosophy and Socialism</em> (1898), is a collection of 12 letters to Georges Sorel, in which the absurdity of Positivism’s fatalistic scientific-functional concept of social evolution is exposed. Here Labriola’s criticism was turned, in particular, to the Darwinist interpretations of the human development. It is in these letters that Labriola speaks for the first time about historical materialism as the “philosophy of the praxis”;</p><p class="indentb">d) <em>From One Century to the Next</em> (1900-1, published posthumously by Croce, who from his youth had been interested in Marxism thanks to Labriola). In this work, Labriola proposes that a true proletarian revolution could only be possible after capitalism had completed the entire cycle of its development, including expansion into the colonies. In an interview of 1902, of which a great fuss has been made, he expressed a favorable attitude Italian colonialism in Africa.</p><p class="quoteb">Translated by Andy Blunden from a biography by Enrico Galavotti, with minor alterations.</p><p>Trotsky says in his autobiography, <em>My Life</em>:</p><p class="quoteb">“It was in my cell <span class="context">[in 1898]</span> that I read with delight two well-known essays by an old Italian Hegelian-Marxist, Antonio Labriola, which reached the prison in a French translation. Unlike most Latin writers, Labriola had mastered the materialist dialectics, if not in politics – in which he was helpless – at least in the philosophy of history. The brilliant dilettantism of his exposition actually concealed a very profound insight. He made short work, and in marvellous style, of the theory of multiple factors which were supposed to dwell on the Olympus of history and rule our fates from there.</p><p class="quoteb">“Although thirty years have gone by since I read his essays, the general trend of his argument is still firmly entrenched in my memory, together with his continuous refrain of ‘ideas do not drop from the sky.’ After Labriola, all the Russian proponents of the multiplicity of factors, Lavrov, Mikhaylovsky, Kareyev, and others, seemed utterly ineffectual to me. Many years later I was wholly at a loss to understand some of the Marxists who had succumbed to the influence of the sterile treatise on ‘Economics and the Law,’ written by the German professor, Stammler. It was just another of the innumerable attempts to force the great stream of natural and human history, from the amoeba to present-day man and beyond, through the closed rings of the eternal categories – rings which have reality only as marks on the brain of a pedant.”</p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/labriola/index.htm" target="_top">Antonio Labriola Archive</a>.</p>')

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Lane, Joseph (1851-1920)', 'undefined', '<p>19th century English anti-parliamentarist socialist agitator, a founding member of the Social Democratic Federation.</p><p>Lane was born in 1851 in the village of Benson near Wallingford, his father was a cordwainer and his mother was illiterate. Lane had virtually no education, and from an early age he worked on the land. At an early age he also developed an interest in radical politics. He later recalled that during the General Election of July 1865 he “attended all political meetings in Borough of Wallingford,” and questioned the successful Liberal candidate, Sir Charles Dilke, about the abolition of the Game Laws and the House of Lords.</p><p>Lane came to London soon where he witnessed the National Reform League demonstration in July 1866, when angry crowds broke into the park to establish the right of public meeting there an event which hastened the passage of the second Reform Bill, extending the vote to most working-class men in urban areas. In London, Lane worked as a carter, but he managed to fit an increasing amount of political activity into his spare time. During the early 1870s he seems to have been involved in the Land Tenure Reform Association led by the radical philosopher John Stuart Mill and in the republican campaign led by the radical politician Sir Charles Dilke. He was also later said to have belonged to an English section of the International Working Men’s Association and to have supported the Paris Commune in 1871, but this seems to derive from a misunderstanding of his later activities. There is no evidence that Lane began to move beyond radicalism before the end of the 1870s.</p><p>By 1880, however, Lane was involved in several working-class organisations in central London which played an important part in the transition from radicalism to socialism on the British left. The first organisation was formed as the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association in 1874, and became the Manhood Suffrage League in 1875. Its members included several old Chartists, and from 1874 to 1877 its secretary was Frank Kitz, a leading activist in radical, socialist and then anarchist politics for nearly half a century. Lane is first recorded taking part in the discussion in the meetings at the Queen’s Head in Little Pulteney Street in January 1879. The second organisation was the English Section of the Social Democratic Club, which was formed by Kitz in 1877 to link native radicals and foreign (mainly German) socialists living in exile in London, and which acquired its own premises in Rose Street. Its German Section was dominated by Johann Most, a former Socialist Deputy in the Reichstag who produced <em>Die Freiheit</em>, which began as a socialist weekly in 1879 but turned towards anarchism during 1880. </p><p>The third organisation was the Marylebone Radical Reform Association, which was formed in 1879. In January 1880 Lane took the lead in forming its third branch, which held meetings at the Black Horse in Marylebone High Street, near his place of work in Paddington Street. This branch soon moved to the left, and changed its name to the Marylebone Radical Association in April 1880. The fourth organisation was called the Local Rights Association for Promoting Rental and Sanitary Reform, and was actually a front for even more radical activity in 1880.</p><p>During the General Election of April 1880, which resulted in a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, Lane led the Marylebone radicals in pestering the two local Liberal candidates with traditional radical demands for Irish Home Rule, nationalisation of the land, and abolition of the House of Lords. </p><p>The Marylebone radicals rejected a Conservative offer to pay for a radical candidate to split the Liberal vote. But a former Conservative called H.M. Hyndman did offer himself as an independent candidate, with a programme of liberalism at home and imperialism abroad, and he tried to get radical support too. Lane refused, later recalling that “I told him it was only a waste of time.” But when Gladstone’s new Liberal Government soon disappointed radical hopes, some of his comrades continued discussions with Hyndman, and the result was the formation in June 1881 of the Democratic Federation, a coalition of middle-class and working-class radicals under Hyndman’s leadership, working towards an independent labour party with a policy inspired by Marx. </p><p>Lane was involved in the beginning of this process, but soon turned to other activity. In March 1881 he was involved in the Freiheit Defence Committee, which was formed when Most was arrested for welcoming the assassination of the Tsar in <em>Die Freiheit</em>. As well as raising public support for press freedom and arranging a legal defence for Most (who got sixteen months’ hard labour), the committee produced seven issues of an English <em>Freiheit</em> from April to June, edited by Kitz and published by the English section of the Social Democratic Club. At the same time Lane was involved in producing and distributing <em>The Radical</em>, a leftist weekly produced by Frank Soutter and Samuel Bennett from 1880 to 1882.</p><p>Early in 1881, Lane moved to East London, where he spent the rest of his life. He first settled in Hackney, forming a new club, which was called the Socialistic Working Men’s Association in May, the Homerton Section of the Social Democratic Club in June, and the Homerton Social Democratic Club in July. Its original affiliation was with the Rose Street Club, which supplied it with some literature, but it soon became independent. From the start it was unequivocally socialist, and Lane practised the same politics as he preached. He acquired a printing press to produce his own literature, pasting up posters all over the area.</p><p>The Homerton club held meetings on Sunday evenings at the Lamb and Flag in Homerton High Street, until they were closed down by the police at the beginning of 1882.</p><p>Lane was one of two delegates sent by the Homerton Social Democratic Club to the Anarchist International Congress in London in 1881. Private meetings were held at a public house in Charrington Street, Somers Town, during the third week in July; and a large public meeting was held at the Cleveland Town Hall on 18 July. Although the six English delegates were not anarchists, most of the forty foreign ones were, and Lane recalled that he met “Kropotkin, Malatesta, etc.” The Congress confirmed the policy of propaganda by deed, following the repression of socialist propaganda by any other method throughout Continental Europe, and tried to re-establish a socialist international. The English delegates were not reported to have said much in the proceedings. </p><p>When the Homerton Club was silenced, Lane widened his aim to cover the whole East End. He joined a group led by Kitz in organising open-air meetings at Mile End, agitating about housing conditions in the slums, intervening in various meetings and demonstrations with provocative leaflets and banners. They caused a sensation by bringing a banner defending tyrannicide to the Hyde Park mass assembly against Irish Coercion in July 1882. The sensation must have been sharpened by the fact that the banner was a quotation from <em>The Revolutionary Epick</em>, written in 1834 by other than Disraeli, the Conservative leader who had died in 1881. In 1882 Kitz and Lane joined Ambrose Barker and Tom Lemon of the Stratford Dialectical and Radical Club in forming the Labour Emancipation League, based at Mile End and Bethnal Green, which soon became the most important working-class organisation in the growing socialist movement. Its programme included six traditional radical points (adult suffrage and secret ballot; direct legislation by referendum; abolition of standing army; free secular education; freedom of speech, press and assembly; free administration of justice) and two definitely socialist ones (equalisation of wealth; socialisation of production). When the first secretary, Aaron Moseley, resigned Lane took over and established himself as the most effective socialist organiser in London. His old organisation was not completely superseded by the Labour Emancipation League. It continued to exist as the Homerton Socialist Club, and Lane was one of its two signatories to the <em>Manifesto to the Working Men of the World</em>, an unsuccessful appeal for the re-establishment of the International Working Men’s Association which was issued by the London socialist organisations in July 1883. </p><p>Lane never achieved much of a reputation as a writer or a speaker. Most of his writings were anonymous ephemera. In 1887 William Morris wrote that “his obvious earnestness and good faith make him a convincing speaker,” but the <em>Daily News</em> described him as “a humble sort of man” who “dropped his h’s recklessly.” His real gift was for the organisation of agitation and propaganda, and it was in 1882 that this really bore fruit. Lane later recalled:</p><p class="quoteb">“This my mode of operations. Take a room, pay quarter’s rent in advance, then arrange list of lecturers for the three months, then get bills printed, one for each week, then each week paste up bills in streets all around. By the end of the three or six months I had got a few members and got them to take it over and manage it as a branch. I had generally two or three branches on my hands at once.”</p><p>Such branches quickly spread in East London, and the Labour Emancipation League extended its activities into Central and West London, bringing socialist ideas into the open at both indoor and outdoor meetings, and breaking into national politics. Meanwhile the coalition of the Democratic Federation had begun to break up. In 1882 it turned towards socialism, and in 1883 it adopted an openly socialist programme. In January 1884, it began publishing <em>Justice</em>, the first socialist weekly in Britain, and began working more and more closely with the Labour Emancipation League. Lane helped to distribute Justice, and agreed to arrange for delegates from the Labour Emancipation League to attend the annual conference of the Democratic Federation with a view to affiliation. </p><p>In August 1884, the Democratic Federation changed its name to the Social Democratic Federation, and adopted most of the programme and absorbed most of the leadership of the Labour Emancipation League. Lane was elected to the new Executive Council, and immediately joined the opposition to Hyndman’s authoritarian leadership, becoming a member of the caucus round Morris. The new coalition lasted only a few months, and by the end of the year the Social Democratic Federation split into an authoritarian minority led by Hyndman and an anti-authoritarian majority led by Morris. In December 1884, the majority seceded rather than expel the minority, and formed a new organisation called the Socialist League. </p><p>Lane signed both the statement explaining the split, <em>To Socialists</em>, and the <em>Manifesto of the Socialist League</em>, and he joined the Council of the new organisation. He brought with him most of the membership of the Labour Emancipation League, and also his printing press. He became the manager and joint publisher (with Morris) of the Socialist League paper, <em>The Commonweal</em>, and was also an occasional contributor from the first issue. He remained a leading figure in the Socialist League for four years, but he was often unhappy in it, resigning after personal differences temporarily from the Council in 1885 and permanently from the League itself in 1889.</p><p>The Socialist League was itself yet another coalition, united at first mainly by hostility to Hyndman, and it soon developed parliamentarist and anti-parliamentarist fractions, “which are pretty commensurate with the Collectivists and Anarchists,” said Morris, who tried to hold the balance between them. At the first annual conference in July 1885, a draft parliamentarist constitution inspired by Engels was rejected, and abstinence from electoral activity was confirmed. (The Social Democratic Federation put up two candidates in the General Election of November 1885, paid for by Conservative money to split the Liberal vote. The Socialist League produced a leaflet, <em>For Whom Shall We Vote?</em>, concluding: “Do not vote at all!”) At the second annual conference in July 1886, the anti-parliamentarist policy was reaffirmed, but the parliamentarist fraction but factional fighting continued. Lane presented an anti-parliamentarist manifesto to the 1887 annual conference, but the Council decided not to print either of the “rival manifestoes,” as Morris called them, commenting privately that Lane’s was “a long lecture not at all fit for its purpose.” </p><p>Lane therefore arranged to print his draft on his own responsibility. He got some support from Morris, who helped to pay for the printing, and also from Morris’s old friends Charles Faulkner and Philip Webb, and circularised the branches of the Socialist League. In the event the third annual conference in May 1887 rejected both manifestoes in favour of Morris’s “shelving resolution,” which repeated the original anti-parliamentarist policy and postponed the decision for another year. Lane published his manifesto in June, calling it <em>An Anti-Statist Communist Manifesto</em>.</p><p>Lane never returned to the socialist movement, but he kept in touch with some of his old comrades. He moved to Forest Gate, and during the decade before the First World War he produced occasional political leaflets. He died suddenly on 3 September 1920.</p>')

After the murder of Lexemburg and Liebknecht, Levi put pressure on the authorities until the soldiers who murdered them were eventually convicted of the crime.</p><p>Paul Levi was born on 11 March 1883 in Hechingen. As a barrister taking on political cases, he met, defended and came under the influence of Rosa Luxemburg. Levi proved his worth to the revolutionary workers’ movement during the First World War, as Lenin pointed out in his defence in 1921. After Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches were murdered in 1919, he took the helm of the German Communist Party (KPD).</p><p>Levi, however, soon developed differences with the leadership of the Communist International on various organisational and political issues, but his criticisms during the Second Congress of the Communist International were largely unpublished, supposedly because of a ‘paper shortage’. His differences came to a head over the KPD’s disastrous March Action of 1921. Having disagreed with the emissaries of the Communist International when he attended the Livorno congress of the Italian Communist Party, and resigned as the KPD’s Chairman in February 1921, he was out of the way in the lead-up to the March Action. Discussions of this affair at the Third Congress of the Communist International took place more in private than at plenary sessions, and thus the devastating criticisms of it by Lenin and Trotsky, fully concurring with Levi, are not apparent from the minutes and resolutions. Faces and reputations had to be saved, a split prevented, and a new orientation outlined. Diplomacy played a large part in the elaboration of a balance.</p><p>Expelled from the KPD, Levi remained a Reichstag deputy until his death, representing the Social Democratic Party (SPD), whose left wing he led. He published the weekly <em>Sozialistische Politik und Wirtschaft</em>, which analysed and commentated on events. This later merged with <em>Klassenkampf</em>, the journal of the SPD’s Marxist left wing. This grouping was to form the SAP in 1931. Commenting on the tragic death of Levi, Arthur Rosenburg, in his classic study <em>Geschichte der Weimarer Republik</em> (Frankfurt am Main, 1961), described how he had ‘continually developed as a proletarian statesman’, and how, with his calls for ‘the Socialist workers to return to determined class struggle if they wished not merely to preserve their own existence but also the democratic republic... in the coming crisis, decisive sections of the German proletariat should have listened to Levi’ (p196). Levi fell to his death on 9 February 1930. The circumstances were never clarified. He was still investigating, at considerable personal risk, the murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht in an attempt to bring the killers to trial, and some have suggested that he was himself murdered. But the consensus is that his death was an accident. Only one month later, with the fall of the ‘Grand Coalition’ led by Hermann Müller, the Weimar Republic effectively came to an end.</p><p>Articles by Levi can be found in H Gruber (ed), <em>International Communism in the Era of Lenin</em> (New York, 1966 and 1972).

Drafted during the war, he was imprisoned (May 1916 to November 1918) for anti-war activity.  and on August 3, 1914 he opposed voting for war credits at a session of the Social-Democratic parliamentary fraction; but under the pressure of party discipline he voted together with the entire party fraction at the Reichstag session on August 4, 1914.

He studied medicine for two semesters at Columbia University, before returning to study in Vienna, but all throughout, he maintained his detailed observations of animal behaviour. He was awarded a PhD in zoology in 1933. He established colonies of birds on his estate to facilitate his studies, and the observations he published soon gained him an international reputation. In 1935, he described <em>imprinting behaviour</em>, in which ducklings learn to follow their real or foster parents, Lorenz causing much amusement with the ducklings that had adopted him as their parents.</p><p>In 1936, Lorenz founded the German Society for Animal Psychology, and in 1937, he was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy and animal psychology at the University of Vienna.</p><p>From 1942 to 1944 he served as a physician in the German army and was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union.

From 1961 to 1973 he served as director of the Max Planck Institute for Behaviour Physiology, in Seewiesen, and in 1973, together with Frisch and Tinbergen, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning animal behavioural patterns.</p><p>Loren\' work centred on the identification of behavioural patterns that are evolved and inherited by individuals of a species in the same way that anatomical features are inherited, and how specific drives are associated with each behavioural pattern and activate it in response to given stimuli or even <em>autonomously</em> (a cat <em>needs</em> to chase mice, even when i\' not hungry). He also studied how animals respond when conflicting basic drives are activated, putting the animal in a kind of quandry, which makes the action of the drive and the associated behaviour particularly graphic.</p><p>Lorenz applied his ideas to the behaviour of humans, with controversial philosophical and sociological implications. In a popular book, <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/lorenz.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">On Aggression</span></a> (1963), he argued that fighting and warlike behaviour in man are innate drives. While fighting in lower animals has a positive survival function, he observed, such as the dispersion of competitors and the maintenance of territory, war-like tendencies in humans needed to be ritualised into socially harmless or useful behaviour patterns (like sporting competitiveness). In another work, <span class="book">Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge</span> (1973), Lorenz examined the nature of human thought and intelligence and attributed the problems of modern civilisation to the way in which basic drives were being frustrated or manifested in anti-social directions by the conditions of modern life.</p>')

A veteran of World War I, Lowe helped plan the postwar demobilization of the German army, and served in the Socialization Committee which sought to nationalize the German economy. In 1922, Lowe joined the Ministry of Economics of the Weimar Republic. </p><p>In 1926, Lowe joined the Kiel Institute of World Economics, a center dedicated to business cycle research whose other members included Fritz Burchardt, Gerhard Colm, Jacob Marschak and Hans Neisser. In 1926 he published a critique of the existing division between business cycle literature and equilibrium economic theory, and called for the development of a specialised theory of economic fluctuations. </p><p>Drawing on Marx’s scheme of extended reproduction, Lowe found a new manner of conceiving motion in business cycle theory. Lowe’s concern with changing multisectoral structure over the cycle, as outlined in his 1926 essay, preceded and inspired a similar notion in the young Friedrich Hayek’s business cycle theory. Lowe’s own subsequent work, in particular the analysis of the “traverse” from one growth equilibrium to another (1952, 1954, 1976), has its roots in this paper. </p><p>Lowe gravitated to the University of Frankfurt in 1931 where he came into fruitful contact with Horkheimer, Adorno and other members of the “Frankfurt School” — an influence that never left him. As a cosmopolitan, social democrat, ex-member of the German Socialization Committee and an architect of the Weimar Republic, Adolph Lowe’s position in Nazi-controlled Germany was quite untenable and he was one of the first to be removed. He left in 1933 to take up a position at the University of Manchester. Lowe left England in 1940, being perceived as an “enemy alien” — in spite of his naturalization and past history. His <em>Price of Liberty</em> (1936) outlines some of his impressions of Great Britain. </p><p>During his stay at Frankfurt and Manchester, Lowe moved away from business cycle research he had pursued at Kiel and towards social philosophy and economic methodology. His famous 1935 <em>Economics and Sociology</em>, was a “plea for cooperation in the social sciences,” criticising notions of mechanistic rationality and the assumption of the constancy and uniformity of individual behavior. </p><p>Lowe arrived at the New School for Social Research as the director of the “Institute of World Affairs” — that institution’s attempt to resurrect the old Kiel Institute. His indefatigable efforts in this regard led him to temporarily suspend his work on economic methodology and social structure. </p><p>His 1951 article attacking the “mechanistic approach” to economics signalled his return to this field. His pre-war questions began to take a more definite form around this time — namely, in two issues which dominated the rest of his career, the “economic traverse” and “instrumental analysis”. Underlying both of these concepts was the recognition of changing and heterogeneous behavioral patterns — the crux of Lowe’s pre-war musings. If this is granted, then the approach of orthodox economic theory practically irrelevant as the object of study was continuously changing. As noted, the analysis of the “traverse”, already contained in his Kiel work, but only really formulated in the 1950s (e.g. 1952, 1954, 1955), addressed the issue of movements from a particular growth path to another and the detailing of the implied adjustment paths and the modifications in behavioral and economic structures which both engender and are implied by them. Thus, the dynamics behind the traverse, he envisioned to be related to socio-economic evolution which should not, indeed could not, be considered an exclusively economic phenomenon. He continued developing his ideas on the relationship between evolution and growth, in particular, outlining the role of changing behavior and multiple behavior patterns on the resulting economic process. His position is perhaps best outlined in his masterful and inspiring <em>On Economic Knowledge</em> (1965). </p><p>Lowe “retired” in 1963, remaining at the New School as a lecturer, until he returned to Germany in 1983. Lowe died at the age of 102. </p>')

He jointed the newly founded Institute in 1926 and quickly became its leading expert on the sociology of literature and mass culture as well as the managing editor of the journal it launched in 1932, the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung. Heterodox and independent Marxists, open to new intellectual currents such as psychoanalysis, and predominantly Jewish, the Institute’s members swiftly fled Germany when Hitler came to power in 1933. After a year in Geneva, they settled in New York, where Columbia University gave them shelter. Lowenthal maintained a close relationship with his colleagues, even during the war when several of them moved to California and he began to work with the Office of War Information in Washington. Although Horkheimer, Adorno, and Friedrich Pollock returned to Frankfurt to reestablish the Institute after the war, Lowenthal, like former members Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, Otto Kirchheimer, and Erich Fromm, chose to remain in the United States. After seven years as research director of the Voice of America, and another seven years at the Stanford Center for the Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences, he joined the Berkeley Speech Department in 1956 and shortly thereafter the Department of Sociology. Although officially retiring in 1968, Lowenthal remained vigorously active in departmental and University affairs until virtually the end of his life. From 1968 to 1972, he served on the Budget Committee, and in 1973-74, chaired the Sociology Department.</p><p>The celebrated private seminar he conducted with graduate students interested in the sociology of literature was launched during the student strike of 1970 and continued to meet through the last months of 1992. As two of its participants, Jim Stockinger and Terry Strathman, remember it, the seminar produced a remarkable “cross-generational dialogue,” whose focus on literature “was particularly liberating” for sociologists unaccustomed to literary analysis. “Good wine, cheese, hearty and spirited debate and a large dose of German conviviality,” they recalled, “made these evenings unforgettable experiences.”</p><p>Lowentha\' publications were collected during the 1980s, both in German, by the Suhrkamp Verlag, and in English, by Transaction Press. Most notable among them were <em>Prophets of Deceit</em> (written with Norbert Guterman in 1949), <em>Literature and the Image of Man</em> (1957) and <em>Literature, Popular Culture, and Society</em> (1961). Also included were his early writings on Jewish themes and his last ruminations on postmodernism, against whose dangers he warned. His autobiographical reflections, including fascinating conversations with the German sociologist Helmut Dubiel, were published by the University of California as <em>An Unmastered Past</em> in 1987. The extensive interviews he gave in 1989 to another German interlocutor, Frithjof Hager, dealt with postmodernism and other contemporary themes; they stimulated a collection of responses by European and American scholars published in honor of his ninetieth birthday as <em>Geschichte Denken: Ein Notizbuch für Leo Lowenthal</em> by the Reclam Verlag of Leipzig. For his eightieth, he had been the recipient of a Festschrift of celebratory essays in the journal <em>Telos</em>.</p><p>In the last decade of his life, Lowenthal was richly honored on both sides of the Atlantic. Awarded the Berkeley Citation and the Federal Republic of German\' Distinguished Merit Cross in 1985, he also received honorary doctorates from the University of Siegen, the Free University of Berlin, and the University of Hamburg. Further, he was given the city of Frankfurt’s Goethe Medal and Adorno Prize, as well as a year at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. In 1985, the first full-length appreciation of his work was published by Michael Kausch as <em>Erziehung und Unterhaltung: Leo Lowenthals Theorie der Massenkommunikation</em>.</p><p>As the final survivor of the Frankfurt School’s inner circle, he achieved international recognition as a symbol of its remarkable collective achievement.</p><p>Lowenthal’s training in collaborative scholarship and his broad humanistic learning allowed him to play a leading role both in the institutional and intellectual life of the campus as a whole. An early supporter of the Free Speech Movement, but troubled by the excesses that followed, he was a leading member of the faculty committee chaired by Charles Muscatine that produced the widely admired report published as Education at Berkeley.</p><p>Lowenthal displayed an extraordinary ability to maintain close friendships with scholars in disparate fields and begin new ones with members of very different generations. He remained a vital presence long after his active teaching days were over. His quick, often acerbic wit, uncanny shrewdness in judging – and gleefully gossiping about – people, and manifest zest for living life fully never deserted him. Nor did his intransigent refusal to abandon the long-cherished ideals of his youth, even as he soberly acknowledged the improbability of their ever being realized. Ruthlessly unsentimental and impatient with cant of any kind, he nonetheless refused to succumb to the sour cynicism of those who turn into the deadly adults Horkheimer and Adorno warned against.</p><p>From <a href="http://dynaweb.oac.cdlib.org:8088/dynaweb/uchist/public/inmemoriam/inmemoriam1993/@Generic__BookTextView/1841" target="_top">In Memoriam for Lowenthal</a>.</p><p>See <a href="../../../reference/archive/lowenthal/index.htm" target="_top">Leo Lowenthal Archive</a>.</p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../l.htm">Index of the Letter L</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

He was educated at a missionary school and worked in Leopoldville (Kinshasa) and Stanleyville (Kisangani) as a clerk and journalist. In 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a Congolese trade union and joined the Belgian Liberal Party. He was arrested in 1957 on charges of embezzlement and imprisoned for a year. On his release he helped found the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) in 1958. In 1959 Belgium announced a five year path to independence and in the December local elections the MNC won a convincing majority despite Lumumba being under arrest at the time. A 1960 conference in Belgium agreed to bring independence forward to June 1960 with elections in May. Lumumba and the MNC formed the first government on June 23, 1960, with Lumumba as Prime Minister and Joseph Kasavubu as President. </p> <p>His rule was marked by the political disruption when the province of Katanga declared independence under Moise Tshombe in June 1960 with Belgian support. Despite the arrival of United Nations troops unrest continued and Lumumba sought Soviet aid. In September Lumumba was dismissed from government by Kasavubu, an act of dubious legality. On September 14 a coup \'tat headed by Colonel Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko) and supported by Kasavubu gained power. Lumumba was arrested on December 1, 1960 by troops of Mobutu. He was captured in Port Francqui and flown to Leopoldville in handcuffs. Mobutu said Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold made an appeal to Kasavubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to due process of law. The USSR denounced Hammarskjold and the Western Powers as responsible for Lumumb\' arrest and demanded his release. </p> <p>The United Nations Security Council was called into session on December 7 to consider Soviet demands that the U.N. seek Lumumb\' immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. Soviet Representative Valerian Zorin refused U.S. demands that he disqualify himself as Security Council President during the debate. Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, answering Soviet attacks against his Congo operations, said that if the U.N. force were withdrawn from the Congo “I fear everything will crumble.” </p> <p>Following a U.N. report that Lumumba had been mistreated by his captors, his followers threated (on December 9) to arrest all Belgians and “start cutting off the heads of some of them” unless Lumumba was released within 48 hours. </p> <p>The threat to the U.N. cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their U.N. Congo contingents by Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Indonesia, Morocco, and Guinea. The Soviet pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on December 14 by a vote of 8-2. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskjold increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union. </p> <p>Lumumba was then transported on January 17, 1961 from the military prison in Thysville near Leopoldville to a “more secure” prison in Jadotville in the Katanga Province.

In 1889, at 18 years old, Luxembur\' revolutionary agitation forced her to move to Zürich, Switzerland, to escape imprisonment. While in Zürich, Luxemburg continued her revolutionary activities from abroad,  while studying political economy and law; receiving her doctorate in 1898.

It was not long before Luxemburg voiced sharp theoretical differences with the Russian party, primarily over the issue of Polish self-determination: Luxemburg believed that self-determination weakened the international Socialist movement, and helped only the bourgeoisie to strengthen their rule over  newly independent nations. Luxemburg split with both the Russian and Polish Socialist Party over this issue, who believed in the rights of Russian national minorities to self-determination. In opposition, Luxemburg helped create the Polish Social Democratic Party.</p><p>During this time Luxemburg met her life-long companion Leo Jogiches, who was head of the Polish Socialist Party. While Luxemburg was the speaker and theoretician of the party, Jogiches complimented her as the organiser of the party. The two developed an intense personal and political relationship throughout the rest of their lives.</p><p>Luxemburg left Zürich for Berlin in 1898, and joined the <a href="../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp">German Social Democractic Labour Party</a>. Quickly after joining the party, Luxembur\' most vibrant revolutionary agitation and writings began to form.

She stressed that endless reforms would continually support the ruling bourgeois, long past the time a proletarian revolution could have begun to build a Socialist society.

This continual drive became a major point of contention in the German Social Democratic party, primarily opposed by <a href="../../people/b/e.htm#bebel">August Bebel</a> and Karl Kautsky. For such passionate and relentless agitation, Luxemburg earned the nickname "Bloody Rosa."</p><p>Before the first World War, Luxemburg wrote <em>The Accumulation of Capital</em> in 1913; a work explaining the capitalist movement towards imperialism.

Zhou demonstrated a keen intellect early in life. He studied at the Jiangnan Naval Academy, the School of Railways and Mines in Nanjing and the Medical College at Sendai in Japan. During the course of his studies, he became acquainted with social movements aimed at reforming and reshaping Chinese society.</p><p>During the course of Zhou’s political and intellectual development, he concluded that a “literary movement” was needed to build awareness and incite action amongst the oppressed. As early as 1906, he decided to publish a literary magazine, but his early attempts at organizing such an endeavor were unsuccessful. In 1908, he joined the anti-Qing revolutionary party, Guang Fu Hui, and he remained involved with this group up to the Revolution of 1911 which resulted in the removal of the Qing Dynasty. Zhou was ultimately disenchanted with the results of the Revolution, for although the Qing Dynasty was unseated, the people of China languished amidst imperialist intervention and oppressive semi-colonial conditions.</p><p>Zhou Shuren struggled with uncertainty as to how he could best utilize his political awareness while he immersed himself in the study of Chinese culture. He adopted the pen name of “Lu Xun,” partially in tribute to his mother, whose surname was Lu. With some encouragement from peers, Lu ultimately wrote and published his first story, “A Madman’s Diary,” in 1918. The story was published in the May Fourth movement’s magazine “New Youth” Lu’s work was well received and he followed up with a number of other short stories, including his celebrated tale of the Revolution of 1911, “The True Story of Ah-Q.” In 1923, Lu published “A Call to Arms,” which was an anthology of his most acclaimed works.</p><p>Lu Xun quickly gained notoriety as a stirring, insightful, and prolific writer. In addition to writing, Lu worked as an editor, professor and dean of studies. Lu began studying Marxism-Leninism in 1928 and shortly thereafter, he undertook the translation of works concerning Marxist literary theory. Although Lu never joined the Chinese Communist Party, he was widely regarded as a Marxist in the later years of his life and he worked closely with communists in many anti-imperialist and anti-fascist campaigns. Lu advocated a united front by the CCP and the Kuomintang against the forces of Japanese imperialism. While afflicted with tuberculosis, Lu continued to write passionately about the struggle against Japanese aggression until his death in 1936.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <strong><a href="../../../archive/lu-xun/index.htm" target="_top">Lu Xun Archive</a></strong></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../l.htm">Index of the Letter L</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

He was active in the anti-Nazi resistance and was arrested and sent to a German prison camp in 1944. The Second World Congress of the FI, held after the war, elected him to a leadership position, which he has since maintained. During the 1950s and 1960s, when the Trotskyists operated within the Belgian Socialist Party, Mandel worked in the Economic Studies Commission of the Belgian Trade Union Federation, writing a report on economic concentration. He was expelled from the Socialist Party for opposing its coalition with the Christian Socialists and its acceptance of antistrike legislation. Mandel has been barred at various times from entering the United States, France, Switzerland, and Germany, where he nonetheless earned a doctorate in political economy at the Free University of Berlin. In 1978 he delivered the Alfred Marshall Lectures at Cambridge University.</p><p>In addition to his prolific activity as an editor and writer for the Trotskyist and other leftist press, Mandel has published several volumes of political essays. By and large he has remained faithful to classic Trotskyist politics, calling (in Europe at least) for a united front of the FI with the Socialist and Communist parties in the formation of a “bourgeois workers’ government,” with an eye to its eventual replacement, once the revolutionary insufficiency of the latter parties is seen by the masses, by a government of “transition to socialism” by the FI alone. The socialism to be established is conceived of as a matter of a nationalized economy with workers’ control operating to the “technologically feasible” extent. In this the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia has shown the way, although the Stalinist-bureaucratic distortions of the socialism established by Lenin and Trotsky may require a political revolution to establish a workers’ government answering to the socialist economy already in place.</p><p>Outside of Trotskyist circles, Mandel’s main impact has been as an economic writer. He is the author of books on the economic competition between Europe and America and on capitalism’s recent difficulties: his little Introduction to Marxist Economics is said to have sold several hundred thousand copies. His main contributions have been the two-volume Marxist Economic Theory (1962) and the massive Late Capitalism (1975). The former aims to show that it is possible, on the basis of the scientific data of contemporary science, to reconstitute the whole economic system of Karl Marx. It thus consists, on the one hand, of the compilation of an enormous mass of data and descriptive material bearing on the nature and history of capitalism and, on the other, of an attempt to integrate parts of bourgeois economics along with elements of the many conflicting Marxist schools into one comprehensive theory. The book includes a consideration of the Soviet economy as exemplifying the “transition to socialism,” marred though it is by Stalinist distortions. </p><p>Late Capitalism more particularly strives to explain the contemporary history of capitalism by its immanent laws of motion. “Late capitalism” is seen as characterized by the dominance of the multinational firm and by the involvement of the state in the national and international economy. Despite these modifications, however, capitalism remains under the sway of the crisis tendency diagnosed by Marx. As in the earlier book, Mandel’s explanation of this tendency involves the combination of a number of seemingly incompatible theories in a “multifaceted” approach, although at base Mandel follows Roman Rosdolsky in holding to a form of underconsumption theory. A novelty is Mandel’s attempt to integrate his eclectic conception into a version of the Kondratiev ‘long wave’ theory of fifty-year cycles of upturns and downturns: this is used, finally, to explain both the long period of prosperity capitalism enjoyed after the last world was and its recent economic misfortunes. </p><p>From: <em>Biographical Dictionary of the American Left</em>.</p>')

A strong advocate of this approach, Mary Marcy, then a member of the S\' left-wing and editor of the <span class="book"><em>International Socialist Review,</em></span> authored of a series of articles in that journal explaining how if workers united and shut down the mines, factories, and transportation, it would be workers, not the ruling class, that would have control of the military and of economic power. This is a position Marcy and the <em>ISR</em> would fearlessly maintain throughout the war years. Marcy also stressed that it is relatively easy for the ruling class to suppress such a revolt by getting rid of the leaders. But when mass action is independent of leaders? It is nearly impossible to stop a rank-and-file revolutionary movement. In her preface to <span class="book"><em>The Life of Eugene Debs</em>,</span> she wrote, "Men do not wage the great class struggle in the study, nor in the editorial rooms....The workers are the fighters and the thinkers of the revolutionary movements." Marcy and others in the left wing of the SP supported reforms such as shorter hours and higher wages, but only in order to educate workers in the class struggle.</p><p>It is not hard to understand how Mary Marcy came to be an outspoken, influential and respected revolutionary writer. Born in 1877 in Belleville, Illinois, Mary Tobias was orphaned as a child. She went to work as a teenager and a few years later taught herself stenography skills while raising her two younger siblings. She learned the consequences of being a political radical early when she was fired for wearing a William Jennings Bryan button to work in 1896--something forbidden by her employer, a maker of American flags. An impressed Clarence Darrow, learning of her dismissal, secured her a job at the University of Chicago where she got the perk of taking tuition-free classes. She studied there, among other things, psychology under John Dewey. In 1901 soon after she married Leslie Marcy, they moved to Kansas City where she took work in a packing firm. Two years later, they joined the SP. Apparently never holding a party office, her role was to educate and motivate workers as well as criticize the SP’s reformist right wing through her writings.</p><p>In 1904, Mary Marcy’s first series of essays were run in the <em>International Socialist Review.</em> The <em>ISR</em> was published by the Marcy’s good friend, Charles Kerr, from 1900 to 1918, when government repression caused it to fold. It was the only socialist paper to support the left wing of the SP as well as the IWW, a position reflected in Marc\' work. One of the early pieces published was Marcy’s was the serialized Marcy classic proletarian fictional work, <span class="book"><em>Out of the Dump.</em></span> This was a strong attack on the "scientific" charity movement, again drawn on Marcy’s own work experience with Associated Charities.</p><p>Marcy dedicated herself to writing for workers in everyday language. She broke down economics into understandable parts with a series on Marxist economics in the <em>ISR</em> which later became the booklet <a href="../../../subject/women/authors/marcy/shop/index.htm"><span class="book">Shop Talks On Economics,</span></a> which was translated into many languages. She wrote stories for children in order to introduce them to historical materialism. She also reported on the major strikes of the day, technology in industry, farm and agricultural issues, elections, international policy, verse for a deck of Socialist playing cards, poetry, and a satirical play on free love.</p><p>Marcy’s focus in the last few years at the <em>ISR</em> was primarily analysis on the crisis surrounding the war. Marc\' writings on the women’s question are controversial. Clearly she put class struggle as primary, but neither did she think women were in any way intellectually inferior to men; encouraging them to join unions and the Socialist Party. Unfortunately a fuller explanation of Marcy’s thoughts and writings may never be known since she left no personal papers and much of what she had in personal records was taken during a Department of Justice raid on her home in 1919. By this time the <em>ISR</em> had ceased publication and she had left the SP to join the IWW. Marcy continued writing articles and letters to her correspondents around the world and worked in support of her comrades that were in prison or enduring government harassment.</p><p>When "Big Bill"  Haywood jumped bail and left for Russia in 1921, the Marcy’s lost their home which was put up for collateral.

His family was Jewish, but converted to Protestanism in 1824. The family was <a href="../../terms/p/e.htm#petty-bourgeois">petty-bourgeois</a>; his father was a lawyer. After graduating from a Gymnasium (High School) in Trier, Marx entered the university, firstat Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoringin history and philosophy. He concluded hisuniversity course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesison the philosophy of Epicurus. At the time Marx was aHegelian <a href="../../terms/i/d.htm#idealist">idealist</a> in his views. In Berlin, he belonged tothe circle of "<a href="../../orgs/y/o.htm#young-hegelians">Left Hegelians</a>" (with <a href="../b/a.htm#bauer-bruno">Bruno Bauer</a> andothers) who sought to draw atheistic andrevolutionary conclusions from Hegel’s philosophy. <a href="../f/e.htm#feuerbach-ludwig">Ludwig Feuerbach</a> began tocriticize theology, particularly after 1836, and he began histurn to <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism">materialism</a>, which in 1841 gainedascendancy in his philosophy (<em>The Essence of Christianity</em>). </p><p>After graduating from university, Marx moved to Bonn,hoping to become a professor. However, the<a href="../../terms/r/e.htm#reactionary">reactionary</a> policy of the government made Marxabandon the idea of an academic career, afterLudwig Feuerbach had been deprived of his chair in 1832 (andwho was not allowed to return to the universityin 1836); and in 1841 the government had forbade the young ProfessorBruno Bauer to lecture at Bonn.</p><p>At the begining on 1842, some <a href="../../terms/r/e.htm#revolutionary">radical</a> bourgeois in the Rhineland (Cologne), who were in touch with the Left Hegelians, founded a paper in opposition to the Prussian government, called the <a href="../../periodicals/r/h.htm#rz">Rheinische Zeitung</a>. Marx and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and in October 1842 Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to Cologne. </p><p>The newspaper’s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more pronounced under Marx’s editorship, and the government first imposed double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January 1 1843 suppressed it. Marx was forced to resign the editorship before that date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended publication in March 1843. Of the major articles Marx contributed to Rheinische Zeitung, Engels notes, an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle Valley. Marx’s journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it. (See: <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/subject/newspapers/rheinische-zeitung.htm" target="_top">Marx’s articles for the Rheinische Zeitung</a>)</p><p>In 1843, Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become engaged to while still a student. His wife came from a bourgeois family of the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia’s Minister of the Interior during an extremely reactionary period – 1850-58.</p><p>In the autumn of 1843, Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad, together with <a href="../r/u.htm#ruge">Arnold Ruge</a> (1802-1880). Only one issue of this journal, <a href="../../periodicals/d/e.htm#dfj">Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</a>, appeared. Publication was discontinued owing to the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement with Ruge. Marx’s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated "merciless criticism of everything existing", and in particular the "criticism by weapon", and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat. </p><p>Also in 1843, Feuerbach wrote his famous <em>Principles of the Philosophy of the Future</em>. "One must have experienced for oneself the liberating effect" of these books, Engels subsequently wrote. "We [i.e., the Left Hegelians] all became at once Feuerbachians." </p><p>In September 1844, <a href="../e/n.htm#engels">Frederick Engels</a> came to Paris for a few days, and from that time on became Marx’s closest friend. Shortly after meeting, Marx and Engels worked together to produce the first mature work of <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#marxism">Marxism</a> – <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm" target="_top">The German Ideology</a>. In this work, largely produced in response to Feuerbach’s materialism, Marx and Engels set down the foundations of <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#marxism">Marxism</a> with the  <a href="../../terms/h/i.htm#historical-materialism">materialistic conception of history</a>, and broke from Left Hegelian idealism with a critique against Bruno Bauer and Max Stirner. "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways;" Marx wrote in an <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm" target="_top">outline for the begining of the book</a>, " the point is to <em>change</em> it."</p><p>In the mid to late-1840s both Marx and Engels took a most activepart in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris (ofparticular importance at the time was <a href="../../terms/p/r.htm#proudhonism">Proudho\'</a> doctrine), which Marx broke into pieces in his  <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm" target="_top">Poverty of Philosophy</a>, (1847).</p><p>At the insistent request of the Prussian government, Marx was banished from Paris in 1845, considered by both governments a dangerous revolutionary. Marx then moved to Brussels. In the spring of 1847 Marx and Engels joined a secret propaganda society called the <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-league">Communist League</a>. Marx and Engels took a prominent part in the League’s Second Congress (London, November 1847), at whose request they drew up the <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm" target="_top">Communist Manifesto</a>, which appeared in February 1848. With outstanding clarity, this work outlines a new world-conception based on <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism">materialism</a>. This document analysises the realm of social life; the theory of the class struggle; the tasks of the <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#communists">Communists</a>; and the revolutionary role of the proletariat – the creators of a new, <a href="../../terms/c/o.htm#communism">communist  society</a>.</p><p>On the outbreak of the Revolution of February 1848, Marx was banished from Belgium. He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution, he went to Cologne, Germany, where <a href="../../periodicals/n/e.htm#nrz">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</a> was published from June 1 1848 to May 19 1849, with Marx as editor-in-chief. The victorious counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was acquitted on February 9, 1849), and then banished him from Germany (May 16, 1849). First Marx went to Paris, where he was again banished after the demonstration of June 13, 1849, and then went to London, where he lived until his death. </p><p>Marx’s life as a political exile was an extremely difficult one, as the correspondence between Marx and Engels clearly reveals. Poverty weighed heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels’ constant and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm" target="_top">Capital</a> but would have inevitably have been crushed by hunger and malnutrition. </p><p>The revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties andin the sixties thrusted Marx back into political work. In 1864 (September28) the <a href="../../orgs/f/i.htm#first-international">International Working Men’s Association</a> – the FirstInternational – was founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul ofthis organization, and author of its <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm" target="_top">first address</a> and of a host of resolutions, declaration and manifestos. In uniting the labor movement of various forms of non-proletarian socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, <a href="../b/a.htm#bakunin">Bakunin</a>, liberal trade-unionism in Britain, <a href="../../terms/l/a.htm#lassallean">Lassallean</a> deviations to the right, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and schools, Marx here hammered out uniform tactics forthe proletarian struggle of the working in the various countries. (See Marx’s writings for the <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1864/iwma/index.htm" target="_top">First International</a>)</p><p>Following the downfall of the <a href="../../orgs/p/a.htm#paris-commune">Paris Commune</a> (1871) – of which Marx gave a clear-cut materialistic analysis of these events in <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm" target="_top">TheCivil War In France</a>, 1871 – and the Bakunin cleavage in the International (See: <a href="../../../archive/marx/works/1868/iwma/index.htm" target="_top">Marx’s conflict with Bakunin</a>), the organization could no longer exist in Europe. After the <a href="../../events/h/a.htm#hague-congress">Hague Congress of the International</a> (1872), the General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in scope, and mass socialist working-class parties in individual national states were formed.</p><p>Marx’s health became undermined by his strenuous work in the International and his still more strenuous writings and organising. He continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the completion of Capital, for which he collected a mass of new material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance; Marx was fully fluent in German, French, and English). However, ill-health prevented him from completing the last two volumes of Capital (which Engels subsequently put together from Marx’s notes).</p><p>Marx’s wife died on December 2, 1881, and on March 14, 1883, Marx passed away peacefully in his armchair.

In 1918, he started to learn as a toolmaker at Siemens, where he was also elected as the apprentices’ delegate on the workers’ council of the company during the German revolution.</p><p>Implicated in many actions during the revolution, arrested several times and threatened with death, Mattick radicalized along the left and oppositional trend of the german communists. After the ‘Heidelberg’ split of the KPD(Spartacus) and the formation for the KAPD in the spring of 1920, he entered the KAPD and worked in the youth organization Rote Jugend, writing for its journal.</p><p>In 1921 – at the age of 17 – Mattick moved to Cologne to find work with Klockner for a while, until strikes, insurrections and a new arrest destroyed every prospect of employment. He was active as an organizer and agitator in the KAPD and the AAU in the Cologne region, where he got to know Jan Appel among others. Contacts were also established with intellectuals, writers and artists working in the AAUE founded by Otto Ruhle.</p><p>With the continuing decline of radical mass struggle and revolutionary hopes – especially after 1923 – and having been unemployed for a number of years, Mattick emigrated to the United States in 1926, whilst still maintaining contacts with the KAPD and the AAU in Germany.</p><p>In the USA, Mattick carried through a more systematic theoretical study, above all of Karl Marx. In addition, the publication of Henryk Grossmann’s principal work, <em>Das Akkumulations</em> – and <em>Zusammenbruchsgesetz des Kapitalistischen Systems</em> (1929), played a fundamental role for Mattick, as Grossmann brought Marx’s theory of accumulation, which had been completely forgotten, back to the centre of debate in the workers’ movement. To Mattick Marx’s ‘critique of political economy’ became not a purely theoretical matter but rather directly connected to his own revolutionary practice. From this time Mattick focused on Marx’s theory of capitalist development and its inner logic of contradictions inevitably growing to crisis as the foundation of all political thoughts with the workers’ movement.</p><p>Towards the end of the 20’s Mattick had moved to Chicago, where he first tried to unite the different German workers’ orgainizations. In 1931, he tried to revive the <em>Chicagoer Arbeiterzeitung</em>, a newspaper steeped in tradition and at one time edited by August Spies and Joseph Dietzgen, but without success. For a period he joined the Industrial Workers of the World, who were the only revolutionary union organization existing in America which, in spite of national or sectoral differences, assembled all workers in One Big Union, so as to prepare the general strike to bring down capitalism. However, the golden age of the Wobblies’ militant strikes had already passed by the beginning of the ’thirties, and only the emerging unemployed movement again gave the IWW a brief regional development. In 1933 Paul Mattick drafted a programe for the IWW trying to give the Wooblies a more solid ‘Marxist’ foundation based on Grossman’s theory, although it did not improve the organization’s condition.</p><p>After some unsuccessful attempts to exercise an influence from the outside on the leninist United Workers Party, Mattick finally founded a council communist group in 1934 with some friends who were originally from the IWW as well as with some expelled members of the UWP. The group kept close contacts with the remaining small groups of the German/Dutch left communism in Europe and published the journal <em>International Council Correspondence</em>, which up though the 30’s became a Anglo-American parallel to the Rätekorrespondenz from the Dutch GIC(H). Articles and debates from Europe were translated along with economic analysis and critical political comments of current issues in the US and elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Apart from his own factory work, Mattick organized not only most of the review’s technical work but was also the author of the greater part of the contributions which appeared in it. Among the few willing to offer regular contributions was Karl Korsch, with whom Mattick had come into contact in 1935 and who remained a personal friend for many years from the time of his emigration to the United States at the end of 1936.</p><p>As the European ‘council communism’ went underground and formally ‘disappeared’ in the second half of the 30’s Mattick let ‘Correspondence’ change its name – from 1938 to <em>Living Marxism</em>, and from 1942 to <em>New Essays</em>.</p><p>Through Karl Korsch and Henryk Grossman, Mattick also had some contact to Horkheimer’s Institut fur Sozialforschung (the later ‘Frankfurter School’). In 1936 he wrote a major sociological study on the American unemployed movement for the Institue, althought it remained in the Institute’s files, to be published only in 1969 by the SDS publishing house <em>Neue Kritik</em>.</p><p>After the United States’ entry into the Second World War and the consequent persecution campaign directed against the entire critical intelligentsia, the left in America was liquidated by Macarthyism. Mattick retired, at the beginning of the 50’s, to the countryside, where he managed to survive through occasional jobs and his activity as a writer. In the postwar development Mattick – like others – made only small and occassional political activities, writing small articles for various periodicals from time to time.</p><p>From the 40’s and up through the 50’s Mattick went through a study of Keynes, and compiled a series of critical notes and articles against Keynesian theory and practice. In this work he developed Marx’s and Grossman’s theory of capitalist development further to meet the new phenomenons and appearences of the modern capitalism critically. </p><p>With the general changes of political scene and the re-emergence of more radical thought in the 60’s Mattick made some more extensive and important contributions. One main work was ‘Marx and Keynes. The Limits of Mixed Economy’ from 1969, which was translated into several languages and had quite an influence in the post-68 student movement. Another important work was ‘Critique of Herbert Marcuse – The one-dimensional man in class society’, in which Mattick forcefully rejected the thesis according to which the “proletariat”, as Marx understood it had become a “mythological concept” in advanced capitalist society. Although he agreed with Marcuse’s critical analysis of the ruling ideology, Mattick demonstrated that the theory of one dimensionality itself existed only as ideology. Marcuse subsequentially affirmed that Mattick’s critique was the only serious one to which his book was subjected.</p><p>Up through the 70’s a lot of old and new articles were published in different languages for various publications. In the academic year 1974-75 Mattick was engaged as ‘visiting professor’ at the ‘red’ University-Center of Roskilde in Denmark. Here he held lectures on Marx’ critique of political economy, on the history of the workers movement and served as critical co-referent at seminars with other guests such as Maximilian Rubel, Ernest Mandel, Joan Robinson and others. In 1977, he completed his last important lecture tour of the University of Mexico City. He spoke in West Germany only twice: in 1971 at Berlin and in 1975 at Hanover.</p><p>In his last years Paul Mattick thus succeeded in getting an audience in new generations for his views. In 1978 a major collection of articles from over 40 years appeared as ‘Anti-Bolshevik Communism’.</p><p>Paul Mattick died in February 1981 leaving an almost finished manuscript for another book, which was laler edited and published by his son, Paul Mattick Jr., as ‘Marxism  Last Refuge of the Bourgeoisie?’</p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090221055640/www.kurasje.org/" target="_top">Kurasje-Archive</a>, which also has a number of Mattic\' works.</p> <p>See <a href="../../../archive/mattick-paul/index.htm" target="_top">Paul Mattick Archive</a>.</p>')

By the time of the 1905 revolution Mayakovsky was already working with the local Social Democrats, and when his family moved to Moscow a couple of years later he joined the Bolsheviks. He did propaganda work for the party until his arrest in 1908, which resulted in an imprisonment of eleven months.</p><p>The imprisonment was crucial to his artistic and political development, as he spent the time reading the classics of world literature. Nevertheless, upon leaving prison he became a key figure of the artistic avant-garde in Moscow, becoming a Futurist, an artistic movement resolutely opposed to all that was old and bucolic, and which praised the city, speed, and modernity. As their manifesto said: “We alone are the face of our time. Time’s trumpet blares in our art of words. The past is stiflingThrow Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc, overboard.” </p><p>From this time until the revolutions of 1917 Mayakovsky was one of the most visible members of the Russian artistic scene. He wrote rough, declamatory poetry and cultivated the image of a hooligan, and poems he wrote during this period, like “ The Cloud in Trousers” and “I,” were among the most important of the time.</p><p>Though Futurism in its original Italian form led directly to fascism, Mayakovsky’s combination of Futurism and residual Bolshevism led him to welcome the October Revolution, and he put his considerable talents at the service of the new state. He produced posters, films and political poems in order to reach as broad a mass as possible. The death of Lenin profoundly moved him, and he gave countless readings in factories, clubs, and at party meetings around the Soviet Union of his poem “Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.” </p><p>But he didn’t deny settle into a populist mode, and was a leading light of LEF, the Left Front in Literature, which included all the modernist figures in the Soviet arts world. When their magazine folded Mayakovsky traveled to Europe and the US in 1925-26, a trip which left him hating capitalism even more. It was this period that gave birth to poems like “Back Home,” where he asked “Gosplan to sweat/ in debate/ assigning me goals a year ahead.” </p><p>But he refused to see Soviet reality in strictly rosy colors, at one point even going so far as planning to write a poem entitled “Bad,” and in 1928 he wrote “The Bedbug,” a play that criticized the NEPmen of the previous years, while holding out the hope of a beautiful communist future. A critical failure, he followed it two years later with a more openly critical play about Soviet reality, “The Bathhouse,” which, after being turned down by Soviet censors, was reworked, mounted, and critically savaged, a writer for <em>Pravda</em> going so far as to say he was playing the Trotskyist’s game. </p><p>Though he tried to defend himself in poetry in “At the Top of My Voice,” the attacks on “The Bathhouse,” and the threats implied by the constant attacks by RAPP, the Federation of Proletarian Writers, broke him physically and morally. He had also always had an emotionally stormy romantic life, including a long and intense affair with Lily Brik, a married woman whose sister Elsa was later to marry the French Communist poet Louis Aragon. All was coming apart at once, and after a stay in a rest home he, who had harshly criticized the poet Sergei Esenin for taking his own life in 1925, committed suicide on April 14, 1930. In his suicide note he wrote: “Do not blame anyone for my death and please do not gossip. The deceased terribly dislike this sort of thing.

A man who has brought with him the rare qualities of selflessness and utter devotion to the cause of the oppressed and exploited millions of our country.</p><h5>Makings of a revolutionary</h5><p>Govan Mbeki was born in the Transkei on 9 July 1910. He spent the better part of his early life in the Transkei and came to gain a first hand knowledge of the conditions and problems facing the majority of the small peasants in the area, a phenomenon which was to be found in most other parts of South Africa at the time.</p><p>From being one of the most important producers of grain and wool for export at the time of the discovery of gold and diamonds the Transkei at the turn of the century was gradually being reduced to critical dependence on the developing capitalist economy ushered in by the mining revolution. It was the intimate knowledge gained during this time that enabled him to write with such incision on the relationship between migrant labour and capitalist production.</p><p>Govan received his early education through mission schools. He passed his high school examinations and went on to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of Fort Hare. In 1936 he completed his degree in Politics and Psychology together with a Teaching Diploma.</p><p>His teaching career was short-lived. It ended with the sack on every occasion because of his political activities among the students and the local community, and for organising workers and trade unions. If the conditions in the Transkei made a deep impression on Govan, his experiences in Johannesburg, where he moved to early in 1929 completed the picture of the desperate plight of the African working people throughout the country: “Once again I saw the poverty of the black Africans. Where I lived - in the city and in the suburbs - police raids were always taking place. Either they wanted to check our passes, or were looking for illegal drink. No other event up till then had provoked my anger as much as those raids and I decided definitely to join the struggle to put an end to such a system.” </p><p>Earlier in 1925 he had become interested in the activities of the Industrial and Commercial Worker’s Union (ICU), the first mass-based worker’s movement in South Africa of black workers.</p><p>By 1938 he had abandoned the idea of a career in teaching and back in the Transkei devoted himself to local politics and writing. The first publication was a magazine called “Territorial Magazine” later renamed “Inkundla Ya Bantu”. In 1939 he published his first essays in book form, “The Transkei in the Making”. By 1941 he was actively involved in a number of local and regional organisations such as the Transkei Voters Association, Transkei Organised Bodies, and the Transkei Territorial Authorities General Council, the Bunga, as it was commonly known, a government inspired creation of elected members, such as Govan, and nominated chiefs, which had very limited administrative powers in the Transkei.</p><p>Govan was to refer to the latter organisation as a toy telephone: “You can say what you like but your words have no effect because the wires are not connected to an exchange.” </p><p>Govan established widespread contacts during this period and working through such organisations. At the same time, through his writings and his activity, he came to be respected and accepted as “a man of the people”. Always the practical revolutionary Govan, even in this period, did not confine himself to agitating and organising people politically, but attempted to assist the small peasants by encouraging them to form simple co-operatives, to pool their resources and labour, so as to improve production. He published an easily understood pamphlet on co-operative farming.</p><h5>The Liberation Press</h5><p>Govan Mbeki was among those who early on recognised the power of the written word as much as that of action by the people in the liberation struggle. As well as possessing a sharp mind, he had a literary ability which was capable of translating the reality of apartheid South Africa in its social, political, economic and other facets in to the written word. His early efforts were mainly due to his own initiative. But in 1954 he joined the editorial board of New Age which was to be the only national newspaper serving the liberation movement for the next eight years. Together with Ruth First and Brian and Sonya Bunting and the other members of the editorial board, Govan played an immensely important role in ensuring that the pages and columns reflected the conditions of the black peoples, their demands and aspirations.</p><p>Govan and his staff on the “Eastern desk” of New Age were responsible for opening the eyes of black South Africans, especially the political leadership of the movement, to the fierce and bloody struggles in the countryside between the regime and the peasants from the period 1956 to 1960.</p><p>In November, 1962 the then Minister of Justice, JB Vorster, banned New Age, a fate which had befallen its predecessor, The Guardian, almost 10 years earlier. When the Editorial Board came out with its successor, Spark, Vorster went one step further by banning not the newspaper, but its editors and writers - stopping them from having anything to do with the preparation, editing, printing and distribution of the paper. Changing the names of the liberation newspapers had been the name of the game till them. Changing its makers proved impossible.</p><p>Rather than remain cut off from the movement Govan went underground. The first explosions of the armed struggle had already rocked South Africa on the 16th December, 1961.</p><h5>South Africa: The Peasants’ Revolt</h5><p>Between 1956 and 1960 one of the fiercest of confrontations between oppressor and oppressed in South Africa took place. The epic of the heroic resistance and violent confrontation is to be found in Govan Mbeki’s book “South Africa: The Peasants’ Revolt”. The book, which was begun on rolls of toilet paper and smuggled out while Govan was awaiting trial under the Explosives Act, earned him international recognition and an honorary doctorate of Social Science from the University of Amsterdam.</p><p>Much of the book deals with the revolutionary potential of the poor peasants and agricultural workers. Between 1956 and 1960 revolts broke out in many parts of the countryside. Notably in Zeerust, Sekhukhuniland, Zululand and finally in Pondoland where the confrontation took on the form of a sustained armed conflict. The causes were many: the imposition of government-favoured chiefs, the deportation or arrest of popular ones; pass laws for women and increased state taxes; forced removals, cattle culling and dipping, land rehabilitation schemes. The terror and repression let loose was terrible as armed units of the fascist state moved in with armoured cars and helicopters. In Sekhukhuniland 16 peasants, including women, were executed. In Pondoland more than 5,000 were arrested and detained. In every area hundreds of arrests, imprisonment and deportations were taking place.</p><p>The height of organised revolt to white domination and its local lackeys was in Pondoland where the people set up their own administration - Intaba - The Mountain Committee. Resistance was skilfully organised, fearless and sustained.</p><p>The peasants, Govan concluded, had demonstrated to the movement in practice what it had always preached in theory, namely, impoverished peasantry, many of them semi-proletarians, constituted a revolutionary force of immense potential, once organised</p><h5>Armed struggle</h5><p>Even as editor of the New Age in the Eastern Cape, Govan was immersed in the practical politics of mass political mobilisation, organising branches of the ANC, publicising the movement’s policies. He was chairman of the ANC in the Eastern Cape, and places like New Brighton became synonymous with ANC militancy. At the same time he was an active member of the underground Communist Party.</p><p>When the limits of peaceful, non-violent struggle were exhausted and the decision taken to continue the political struggle using all means, including armed struggle, Govan became one of the key figures of the underground leadership. It was in this capacity that he was arrested at Rivonia and later sentenced to life imprisonment with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Elias Motsoaledi, Ahmed Kathrada, Denis Goldberg, Raymond Mhlaba and Andrew Mhlangeni.</p><p>On June 26th, 1980 the Secretary General of the African National Congress, Alfred Nzo, announced the conferring of the time-honoured title of Isithwalandwe on Govan Mbeki. Govan was not present to receive the highest honour that his people and his movement can bestow on any individual, because he was serving a life imprisonment sentence on Robben Island.</p><p>Govan was released from prison on 5 November 1987, and immediately continued with the work of the African National Congress.</p><p>Besides “South Africa: The Peasants’ Revolt”, Mbeki has also published “The Struggle for Liberation in South Africa” (1992) and “Sunset at Midday” (1996).</p><p>After the historic democratic elections of 1994, Govan was elected Deputy President of the Senate.</p><p>Govan Mbeki died in September 2001 in Port Elizabeth</p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/" target="_top">ANC Web site</a>.</p><p>See also <a href="../../../subject/africa/mbeki/index.htm" target="_top">Govan Mbeki Archive</a>.</p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../m.htm">Index of the Letter M</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

He joined the Radical Philosophy group in 1976, and he was prominent thereafter as a contributor and a member of the editorial collective of the journal. In three meticulously argued books and a number of papers he developed a distinctive perspective on the thought of Marx and Hegel, which was deeply immersed in the original texts and yet thoroughly alive to the realities of present-day capitalism. His writings were a model of clarity both in their exposition of complex issues and in their exact English style.</p><p>McCarney held a post as a lecturer in Philosophy at London South Bank University from 1969 until 2000. At the time South Bank was a magnet for working-class students, many of them mature, and also academics, such as McCarney, committed to social equality. The only full-time philosopher at South Bank, McCarney was a gifted teacher. He developed courses there on Political Ideology, Social Philosophy, Human Rights, and Medical Ethics. </p><p>The central theme of McCarney’s work revolved around the question of the relationship of theory and practice in Marx. While it is clear that Marx envisaged his theoretical work as a force on the side of the proletariat in the class struggle, McCarney fiercely opposed the characterization of Marx’s theory as ‘critical social science’. He felt that its practical significance belongs to its peculiar nature as science, not as critique. In rigorously developing this conception, McCarney suggested that the key to it lay in Marx’s debt to Hegel. McCarney argued that ‘a certain conception of the theory-practice relationship constitutes the core of Marx’s Hegelianism and embodies the sense in which he remains all his life a faithful Hegelian’.?</p><p>McCarney’s first book, <b>The Real World of Ideology</b> (1980), set itself squarely against the view (almost universal then and still extremely prevalent today) that by ‘ideology’ Marx meant ‘false consciousness’, or a cognitively defective view of the world that was spontaneously produced by social structures. Marx never used the term ‘false consciousness’; it was a coinage of Engels’s, and even then did not mean what it was taken to mean. (For a review of this myth see McCarney’s ‘<a href="http://www.marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm" target="_top"><b>Ideology and False Consciousness</b></a>’.) Using a wealth of textual evidence, McCarney argued that for Marx ideology simply meant ideas that serve to advance class interests. The function of ideology is to be the medium of class struggle in the realm of ideas; the ideology of a particular class will consist of the ideological weapons at its disposal in that struggle. As he put it, ‘the real world of ideology is class society and class conflict, and it disappears from the historical stage with the close of the epoch that is characterised by those conditions.’</p><p>McCarney then pressed his case further, arguing that the current view of ideology was symptomatic of a ‘Western Marxism’ that, in the wake of the defeats of the 1930s, resiled altogether from the idea of class struggle. The result was that figures such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Louis Althussser, and later the Althusserians and ‘Analytical Marxists’ of his own time, had completely lost touch with the classical tradition of Marx, Engels and Lenin. (Lukács was exempted from this criticism. His most influential works were written while the optimism engendered by the October Revolution still obtained, of course.) </p><p>McCarney’s <b>Social Theory and the Crisis of Marxism</b> (1990) set itself against the stream; as he said, the assumption that an emancipatory socialist theory must be essentially a critique of capitalist society is now so pervasive as to constitute a whole climate of opinion. The central feature of contemporary Marxism, he argued, was that it understood itself as a ‘critical theory’ of society: a theory that showed that capitalism failed by some ethical or rational standard. Whether the standard was an external one, as in critiques based on freedom, equality or justice, or whether it was simply one of self-consistency, as in so-called ‘immanent critique’, McCarney asserted that such a conception of his theoretical work was utterly alien to Marx himself. Instead Marx began with the idea that socialism was the ‘hidden truth and emergent reality of capitalism’ and that the working class was driven by its circumstances to become the agent that would bring this reality about. Marx conceived his own theory as articulating the understanding of the world that was anyway developing within the working class, so that it would facilitate the overthrow of capitalism without ever involving itself in a moral critique of it. So his theory was an expression of class struggle. (More controversially, McCarney went on to argue that it was no longer possible to identify the working class of the advanced capitalist countries as the agent that would bring about socialism. He added that today we must look to the oppressed masses of the ‘Third World’ as the agent of revolution.)</p><p>Marx’s conception of the logical status of his own work committed him to denying that revolutionary theory needs a moral, or indeed any normative, dimension. As McCarney acutely observed, Marx, like Hegel before him, had a kind of aristocratic, proto-Nietzschean, disdain for habits of complaining and fault-finding, and taking refuge in idealistic dreams. But if so, McCarney asked, how does Marx’s theory have practical significance? The answer lay in a form of knowledge which is expressive of the necessity inherent to its object. Dialectical theory surrenders to the life of its object and seeks to bring that life into the light of consciousness. It cannot add anything of its own without betraying its own character, and in particular must not seek to provide a normative commentary to mediate the stages in the life of the object. From this perspective a central role is assigned to the category of ‘contradiction’; it is above all contradictions that need bringing to light. Such an activity itself transforms the situation, not merely the conceptual field, where self-contradiction is concerned. The proletariat is compelled to rebel by the contradiction of its existence when it becomes aware of its own nature and the nature of its situation. The role of revolutionary theory is to be the self-consciousness of the emancipatory historical subject.</p><p>Thus the immediate object of dialectical social science is provided by social contradictions, specifically the intersubjective contradiction of class society. Through the development of social scientific insight, subject classes achieve a grasp of the true nature of their situation. This process includes qualitative leaps made possible by the universalisng power of theoretical concepts. The whole development may be seen as actualizing the contradictions of the preconceptions derived from the ruling ideology and reality as it is experienced and understood. This is the substance of the idea that ratiocination about the desirability of social change is itself already a form of such change. Thus, it serves as the driving force of the dialectic of class-consciousness. More specifically, the conflict between classes can be superseded in a transition to a new society only if the historical process becomes conscious for one of the participants, the proletariat. The process of transition is explicated in terms of the directly transformative power of the discovery of self-contradictions by a historical subject.</p><p>The shift from doctrinaire to revolutionary science is precisely that from a normative to a dialectical conception. Once it has taken place, theory is no longer a vision of what ought to be but the voice of an emergent movement of reality which in becoming articulate is enabled to develop its world-transforming potential. It was this conception of social theory, shared by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Lukács, that Marxists needed to recover and develop.</p><p>However, the conception of Marxist theory for which McCarney was arguing depended implicitly not only on identifying a revolutionary agent but also on an underlying confidence that history was tending towards socialism, or in Hegelian terms that the rational was becoming real. It was perhaps this that led him to a study of Hegel’s philosophy of history in the 1990s, culminating in his <b>Hegel on History</b> (2000), a lucid exposition of Hegel’s conception of history as the emergence of universal human freedom. Hegel was convinced that a people once possessed of the spirit of freedom does not willingly surrender it. Rejecting transcendentalist readings of Spirit, McCarney concluded: ‘It is “We” who are responsible for sustaining history in its course and bringing it to an end in freedom.’ He reacted to the failure of the Soviet experiment in a true Hegelian spirit, regarding the reunification of East and West as a natural resumption of the march of world history. He often remarked jovially: ‘The Absolute is not in a hurry.’ He said he was more of a Marxist Hegelian than a Hegelian Marxist.</p><p>He remained to the end of his life a quiet but principled opponent of capitalism, which he once described as ‘systematic violence and terror’. His conception of socialism was typically low key: ‘a truly human society, one that does not, by its nature, systematically obstruct the attempts of the mass of its members to cope with the burdens of being human’.</p><p class="fst">See: <a href="../../../archive/mccarney/index.htm" target="_top">Joe McCarney Archive</a></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../m.htm">Index of the Letter M</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

Her father was reputed to have been Laurent Demahis, the owner’s son, but her father may have been the owner himself, Etienne-Charles Demahis. Anyway, her grandparents raised her as a Demahis, and she received a liberal education from them. Her grandfather had her read Voltaire, Rousseau, and the <i>encyclopedists</i>, and her grandmother taught her to sing and play piano. Louise Michel’s <i>Mémoirs</i> describe her early years as idyllic. In 1850, following her grandparents’ and father’s deaths, her stepmother drove her from the castle.</p><p>She was forced to look for a way to earn her own living. She chose to become an elementary teacher and so attended a teacher’s training academy in Chaumont. In 1852, after obtaining her diploma, she opened a private school in Audeloncourt, not far from Vroncourt. But many parents didn’t like her methods: she took her pupils outdoors so they could discover nature and she also taught them to sing the <i>Marseillaise</i>. These actions led to her repeatedly being called to the <i>Préfet</i>’s office for a reprimand. Later, together with her friend Julie Longchamp, whom she had met in Chaumont, she opened a girl’s school in Millières, where she taught for two years.</p><p>In 1856 she went to Paris, which always attracted her, to teach in a pension. Nine years later, she bought a private day-school in Montmartre. In this period she attended political meetings, where she met Théophile Ferré and his sister Marie, and became violently anticlerical. She also opposed the Second Empire. On July 12, 1870, along with 100,000 others, she went to the funeral of the journalist Victor Noir, who was killed by Pierre Bonaparte. Afterwards, in July, Napoleon III declared the war on Prussia. His troops were quickly overcome and he became a prisoner. </p><p>The Third Republic was proclaimed on September 4, and soon thereafter the Prussians lay siege to Paris. She tried to keep her school open and find food for her students. Her friend Georges Clemenceau, Mayor of Montmartre, helped her.<br />Louise Michel was very politically engaged in this period; she even created with friends <i>Le Comité de Vigilance des Citoyennes du XVIIIème arrondissement</i> [the Vigilance Committee of the eighteenth arrondissement]. When the <i>bourgeois republic</i> tried to forcibly disarm Parisians, it led to the proclamation of the Paris Commune on March 28, 1871. Louise Michel became an ambulance nurse and soldier, belonging to the <i>Montmartre</i> sixty-first battalion. She was everywhere where she could feel the danger. Finally, she surrendered on May 24 because the <i>Versaillais</i> – current name of the authorities who were refugees in Versailles – arrested her mother and threatened to kill her. Her mother was then released, and Louise Michel was incarcerated in Satory prison.</p><p>After having defended herself in court, on December 16, 1871, at the age of 41, she was condemned to be deported. While awaiting deportation to New Caledonia, Louise Michel and other prisoners from the Commune were imprisoned in Auberive (Haute-Marne). These included Beatrix Excoffon and Nathalie Lemel. On August 28, 1873, she embarked on the <i>Virginie</i>, arriving four months later at the fortress of Numbo, in the Ducos peninsula. Although life was difficult there, especially with respect to hygiene and food, she enjoyed it. When she was moved to West Bay, in May 1875, she came in contact with the native people and taught them to read and write. She even helped them withstand the French authorities. But she also assisted to their defeat. Later, in 1879, she left West Bay for Nouméa to become a teacher. In the years in exile she became more receptive to anarchist thoughts.</p><p>Following the general amnesty for Commune prisoners, she returned to France. At that time, her mother just had a paralysis attack. Louise Michel was triumphantly welcomed by 10 000 persons on November 9, 1880, at St Lazare station in Paris. In this period she attended many meetings in France and abroad, where she spoke about her struggle for Social Revolution and anarchism. While such meetings were expensive, Louise Michel viewed them as a way for the middle-classes to contribute to the workers. </p><p>On March 9, 1883, she and Emile Pouget led a demonstration of unemployed workers. She was arrested a month later and imprisoned in <i>St Lazare</i>. Again she defended herself at the trial, but was sentenced to six years in prison. She was transferred to the Clermont detention center (in Oise), which was strictly directed by <i>Versaillais</i>. However, in December 1884, she was authorized to join her mother’s bedside thanks to her friends Clemenceau, Rochefort and Vaughan. Her mother died on January 3, 1885. Louise Michel was released a year later, when she was 56. </p><p>The next five years were spent alternating between attending meetings or in prison. There was even an attempt on her life during a meeting in Le Havre, in 1888, when the extremist Pierre Lucas shot her, but she quickly recovered. In 1890, tired of the gossip and calumny against her, she moved to London. Five years later, her friend Charlotte Vauvelle, who came from the anarchist circle of London, joined her and became a very precious help in her movings. She began to teach again and to lecture. She also gave free lessons of French. As an anarchist, she agreed with the anarchists’ attempts in France. In the last ten years of her life, she traveled between London and Paris, participating in many political meetings and conferences. She also visited comrades in the Netherlands and Belgium. She died in Marseille on January 9, 1905, while on a lecture tour in the south of France.</p><p class="inline">Hélène Saudrais: <a href="http://www.iisg.nl/collections/louisemichel/" target="_top">http://www.iisg.nl/collections/louisemichel/</a></p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../history/france/paris-commune/michel-louise/index.htm" target="_top">Louise Michel Archive</a>.</p>')

By the age of eight, he had read most of the Greek classics and made his own translation of many, read a great deal of history and started Latin, the geometry of Euclid, and algebra. By the age of 10 could read Plato and others with ease. About the age of 12, he began a thorough study of Scholastic logic, reading Aristotle in the original. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

He wasa famous opponent of Protestantism, and wrote a number of extremelypolemical works on the matter, finally being banned from publishing by thegovernment. He was eventually consigned to the Tower of London for hisdogged defence of Catholicism, and then beheaded after being tried fortreason. For this he was canonised in 1935 by Pope Pius XI.</p><p>While for some More is inevitably remembered for his services toCatholicism, his “Utopia” is completely unconcerned with Catholic issues,and it is in bequeathing this word to the English language that he has hadthe greatest influence. Although obviously founded from an ancient Greeketymology, the term “utopia” as we use it actually originates in ThomasMore’s 1515 book of that name, and More’s book still provides us with acomplex meditation on issues and questions that remain prescient, such as“What is a utopia?” “Is a utopia a mere fantasy, a guiding ideal, orsomething else?” “Can the utopian be more than an ideal?”</p><p>In our usage of this word it is often forgotten that many of these complexissues had already been played upon by More, and the word is even thrownaround as a simple pejorative (see e.g. Engels’ “Socialism: Utopian andScientific”). “Utopia” has come to signify the romance of an ideal unrelatedto reality, and thus increasingly seems to signify something tragic orsimply pathetic; an unfulfilled or unfulfillable dream.</p><p>More, however, was already well aware of these possible aspects to theutopian. The title of the book, for example, is famously a self-underminingjoke: u-topia means “non-place” or “nowhere”. In fact, More revels in suchtricks, and has the description of the island of Utopia narrated by a“Raphael Hythloday”, whose name roughly translates as “talker of nonsense”.It is hard to fathom the extent to which such tropes are merely More’smischievous sense of humour, and the extent to which they are a politicalsafeguard for a book which could have got him into trouble. Since the firsthalf of the book contains a sustained social criticism of the England of hisday, and the second proposes an alternative, it is impossible not to reasonthat there is a great deal more at stake than More’s sense of humour; but isall this irony simply political self-defence? We can at least say that hedoes not merely mean to argue that “utopias” are by definition vacuous ideasthat are unworthy of attention.</p><p>The addenda to “Utopia” are commonly forgotten, but in many senses they arethe key to the rest of the book. These, presented as an assemblage ofdocumentary fragments, tell us of a place that is on the fringes of realknowledge- an alphabet is known, but not included here; maps do not exist,but one missing sailor knows the way, and so on. Most importantly, Morerenders the apparent joke of his title distinctly ambivalent, as he tells usin verse that the island is not correctly the “nowhere place” of u-topia,but the “good place” of eu-topia. His self-undermining joke is thus itselfin a sense placed “under erasure”, and the island is reasserted as a goodplace. Furthermore, he compares his Utopia to Plato’s Republic, and in doingso plays upon a tension between the ideal and the real:</p><p class="quoteb">“I one of all other without philosophy<br />Have shaped for man a philosophical city.”</p><p>and,</p><p class="quoteb">“For what Plato’s pen hath platted briefly<br />In naked words as in a glass,<br />The same have I performed fully.”</p><p>With his many references to philosophical ideals, poetry and language, as hecompletes his book, it would seem that More is partly alluding to howutopias may be constructions of language, and that his is necessarily priorto completion – for the Utopian alphabet itself is missing. Yet we should notover-emphasise the latter poetic aspects of the book; rather, Utopia is aconstruction of two complementary halves, and the first of these is a pieceof social criticism. More, in fact, seems to have consciously divided Utopiabetween real (the First Book) and ideal (the Second Book), and the whole canbe read as a play on the tension between these two, which is underlined byhis play on the names “Utopia” and “Eutopia”. Perhaps it is that More’s workshows us that social criticism must work between these two poles; that ittakes its authority not only from the positively real, but also from theimpossibly idealistic.</p><p>As the narrator says, speaking More’s thoughts at the conclusion to BookTwo: there is much to wish for in Utopia, though there may be doubt aboutsuch things ever coming to be. It is, however, certain that More wished thatthe Utopian were not only “nowhere”, but that the Eutopian (the good place)might actually come about.</p><p>See <span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/archive/more/works/utopia/index.html" target="_top">Utopia</a></span>.</p><p class="inline">Rob Lucas</p>')

Muralov came out of the building with a revolver in his hand and walked evenly toward the crowd. It moved back a little. But the shock company of the Black Hundred blocked his path, and the cabmen began to howl taunts at him. “Clear a way,” ordered the giant without slackening his advance, as he raised the hand holding the revolver. Several men pounced on him. He shot one of them down and wounded another. The crowd drew back again. With the same even step, cutting his way through the crowd like an ice-breaker, Muralov walked on and on toward Moscow.</p><p class="quoteb">His subsequent trial lasted for two years, and, in spite of the frenzy of the reaction that swept over the country, he was acquitted. An agricultural expert by training, a soldier in an automobile detachment during the imperialist war, a leader of the October fighting in Moscow, Muralov became the first commander of the Moscow military region after the victory. He was a fearless marshal of the revolutionary war, always steady, simple, and unaffected. In his campaigning he was a tireless living example; he gave agricultural advice, mowed grain, and in his free moments gave medical treatment to both men and cows. In the most difficult situations he radiated calm, warmth, and confidence. After the close of the war, Muralov and I always tried to spend our free days together.

Along with <a href="../../../archive/rosmer/index.htm">Alfred Rosmer</a> and <a href="../../../archive/tomsky/index.htm">Mikhail Tomsky</a>, Murphy was elected to the provisional leadership and was tasked with the responsibility of returning to England to establish the British Bureau, and then travel back to Moscow for its first Congress.</p><p>In addition to his work with the RILU, Murphy was a significant figure in the Comintern. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) and headed the British section, which included Ireland and the colonies, and, later, the Anglo-American Committee. He was also a member of the Eastern Commission that handled issues relating to China and Japan, and, in 1926, was elected to the Presidium and Political Secretariat.</p><p>His rise in the Comintern apparatus coincided with Stalin’s consolidation of power. Murphy was acutely aware of the CPSU’s internal conflicts and ultimately sided with <a href="../../../reference/archive/stalin/index.htm">Stalin</a> over <a href="../../../archive/trotsky/index.htm">Trotsky</a> and the <a href="../../orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition">Left Opposition</a>. Following the Fifth Congress of the Comintern in 1924, Murphy returned to England and, at a council meeting of the CPGB, moved the main resolution denouncing Trotsky for his “open attack upon the present leadership of the Communist International, which in the opinion of the CPGB, will not only definitely encourage the British Imperialists, the bitterest enemies of Soviet Russia, but will also encourage their lackeys of the Second International, and those other elements who stand for the liquidation of the Communist International and the Communist Party in this country.” </p><p>Three years later, it was Murphy who moved the Presidium resolution expelling Trotsky from the ECCI.</p><p>In 1932 Murphy came into conflict with the CPGB leadership when he advanced the idea that the Party should mount a campaign to pressure employers and the British government to give credits for industrial products to the Soviet Union. <a href="../../../archive/pollitt/index.htm">Harry Pollitt</a>, the Party’s General Secretary, disagreed on the grounds that this would solve the country’s market crisis and undermine current campaigns.

By the age of 24, Bonaparte considered himself the heir to the (presently non-existent) throne of the great Napoleon. Believing his heritage would inspire the loyalty of French soldiers, Bonaparte attempted and completely failed to win over the Strasbourg garrison for a coup d'état on October 30, 1836. Ruling French King Louis-Philippe exiled him to the United States, but only a few months later Bonaparte returned to Switzerland, to see his dying mother.

Bonapartes supporters, however, among them the Party of Order, supported him in the elections putting his position in the September at five departments, which he took as a start to run for the office of the presidency. After intensive campaigning and propaganda, in December, 1848, Bonaparte was the only candidate voted for. In the presidency, Bonaparte immediately sent French legions to help the Pope reconquer Rome and at home he subdued workers with stern brutality.</p><p>Bonaparte spent much of this time consolidating power, and staffing the government administration with people in support of him.  But the Constitution dictated that the president have only a four-year term, and Bonaparte, not all satisfied with this, sought to amend the Constitution – but he was unable to get the majority he needed to legally do so.

Nearing’s grandfather, Winfield Scott Nearing, had arrived in Tioga County with his family in 1864, at the age of 35, when he accepted a job as a civil and mining engineer. Fefore the end of the year he had assumed full control of mining operations as the superintendent of the Morris Run Coal Company, a position of authority which he held for the remainder of his workng life.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> An intense, driven man, Scott Nearing’s grandfather studied science and nature, practiced gardening and carpentry, and regularly received crates of books from New York City, amassing a large personal library.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> In his memoirs written late in his life, Scott Nearing would recall his grandfather as one of the four most influential figures in his life.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> Nearing’s upbringing was that of a young bourgeois, his mother employing a part-time tutor and two Polish servants to clean the gleaming white house atop a hill overlooking the town.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> Scott’s brother recalled that the citizens of Morris Run had treated the handsome and intelligent Scott “the way they would treat the heir to the nobleman.... They all treated him with awe.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing’s father was a small businessman and stockbroker, his mother a vigorous, energetic, and idealistic woman who Nearing later credited for providing an appreciation of the higher things in life – nature, books, and the arts.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup> Despite an upbringing in a life of privilege made possible at some level by the harsh anti-union politics of his patriarchal grandfather,<sup class="enote"><a href="#n7">[7]</a></sup> young Scott Nearing nevertheless developed a social conscience, which one of his biographers describes as “a burr under his skin that none of his relatives acquired and that no interpretation satisfactorily explains.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n8">[8]</a></sup> Scott Nearing’s radical worldview would stay with him for the rest of his life.</p><p>Nearing graduated from high school in 1901 and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Law School, “where coroporate bias so violated his idealism that after one year he quit.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n9">[9]</a></sup> Instead he studied oratory at Temple University in Philadelphia and enrolled in the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania, where he immersed himself in the emerging science of economics. At the Wharton School, Nearing was deeply influenced by Simon Nelson Patten, an innovative and unconventional educator and founding father of the American Economic Association.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n10">[10]</a></sup> Nearing was molded as a “Wharton man” for the current progressive era, one of the proverbial “best and brightest” trained in practical economics to be readied for a place as a responsible leader of the community.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n11">[11]</a></sup> In the words of another of his students, Patten taught innovative thinking – “making use of creative intelligence to master new situations irrespective of received dogma.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n12">[12]</a></sup> Nearing seems to have found these new intellectual tools for potential social change to be exciting and liberating. He completed his undergraduate program in just three years, while simultaneously engaging in campus politics and competitive debate.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n13">[13]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing received his BS degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1905 and his PhD in Economics in 1909. From 1905 to 1907, he served as the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, a volunteer society working to solve the child labor problem in the state.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n14">[14]</a></sup> From 1908 until 1915, Nearing himself taught economics and sociology at the Wharton School and Swarthmore College, authoring a stream of books on the economics and social problems.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n15">[15]</a></sup> Nearing was a staunch advocate of a “new economics” which insisted</p><p class="indentb">“that the economists part company with the ominous pictures of an overpopulated, starving world, prostrate before the throne of ‘competition,’ ‘individual initiative,’ ‘private property,’ or some other pseudo-god, and tell men in simple, straightforward language how they may combine, re-shape, or overcome the laws and utilize them as a blessing instead of enduring them as a burden and a curse.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n16">[16]</a></sup></p><p>Much as Karl Marx drew radical implications from the ideas of the conservative Hegel, Nearing took the economic logic of his department head, Simon Patten, and made radical inferences about wealth and the distribution of income that his mentor had himself hesitated to draw.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n17">[17]</a></sup> He believed that unfettered wealth stifled initiative and impeded economic advancement, and hoped that progressive thinkers among the ownership class itself would come to realize the negative impact of economic parasitism and accept their civic duty of enlightened leadership.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n18">[18]</a></sup> Nearing instead outlined an economic republicanism based upon “four basic democratic concepts – equality of opportunity, civic obligation, popular government, and human rights.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n19">[19]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing’s aggressive social activism in the classroom and through the printed word brought him into conflict with his own employers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, resulting in his dismissal and his emergence as a <em>cause célèbre</em> of the American radical movement for the next decade. On the morning of June 16, 1915, Nearing’s secretary telephoned him to report that a letter from the Provost had arrived, which noted that “as the term of your appointment as assistant professor of economics for 1914-1915 is about to expire, I am directed by the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to inform you that it will not be renewed.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n20">[20]</a></sup> The Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania was heavily stacked with bankers, corporation lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives, and Nearing’s writing had not gone unnoticed.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n21">[21]</a></sup> Nearing’s tenuous situation had been exacerbated by an open letter to <em>The North American</em> in which he challenged the right wing evangelist Billy Sunday to apply the Gospel to the conditions of industrial capitalism, including “the railroad interests... the traction company... the manufacturers... the vested interests.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n22">[22]</a></sup> Reaction to Nearing’s dismissal from the academy was swift, with department head Patten and others issuing statements condemning the decision. Progressives in the Wharton School quickly compiled a summary of the facts of the case and sent it to 1500 newspapers, journals, and academics around the country.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n23">[23]</a></sup> Even conservatives in the faculty were deeply troubled since, as one Wharton professor observed, “the moment Nearing went, any conservative statement became but the spoken word of a ‘kept’ professor.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n24">[24]</a></sup> Conversely, some radicals were satisfied for being validated in their belief of the conservative nature of the American academy. Socialist writer Upton Sinclair told Nearing in no uncertain terms in an open letter that “You do not belong in a university. You belong with us Socialists and free lances.... Instead of addressing small numbers of college boys, you will be able to address large audiences of men.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n25">[25]</a></sup> Retrospectively called by one historian “the most famous breach of academic freedom” of the era,<sup class="enote"><a href="#n26">[26]</a></sup> the University of Pennsylvania’s action had the effect of making Scott Nearing into a public figure and fueled a long-running discussion about the proper role and rights of the teacher.</p><p>From the Fall of 1915, Scott Nearing was established as a radical “public man.” He joined the American Union Against Militarism in 1916 and delivered a series of speeches condemning the “Preparedness” campaign then being promoted by Woodrow Wilson and the nation’s political elite.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n27">[27]</a></sup> He also remained a university professor, teaching Social Science at city-owned Toledo University from 1915 through 1917. The intense nationalistic feeling that swept the country now that America was embroiled at last in the war in Europe spelled the end of Nearing’s Toledo days, as he later recalled in his memoirs:</p><p class="indentb">“Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, asked me to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly and then said, ‘As you know, I am attorney for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution.’ He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.</p><p class="indentb">‘Of Course,’ I said quietly. ‘That is one of the symptoms of war fever. Those who tell the truth or try to tell the truth are among the first victims of any war.’</p><p class="indentb">Al hurried on, ‘You understand, there is nothing personal about this. You and I have worked together on the Forum and other projects with never a real disagreement, certainly never a fight.’</p><p class="indentb">‘That is true,’ I said, ‘and I think our joint efforts have helped to make some real advances here in Toledo.’</p><p class="indentb">‘True,’ said Al. ‘It is also true that I have enjoyed every minute of our cooperation.’ Then he added: ‘At this point I guess we part company. I hope we part as friends, on two sides of the war barrier that separates us. Please remember that there is nothing personal about this,’ he repeated. ‘I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere.’ We shook hands and I never saw him again.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n28">[28]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing packed up his things and moved to New York City, where he became a founding member of the broad anti-war organization the People’s Council, the establishment of which took place at the so-called First American Conference for Peace and Democracy, held May 30-31, 1917. He assumed the chairmanship of that organization that fall.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n29">[29]</a></sup> On July 1, 1917, Nearing joined the Socialist Party and began a new job, working for the next six years as a lecturer in Economics and Sociology at the Socialist Party’s Rand School of Social Science.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n30">[30]</a></sup> He was a prolific public speaker during this time, estimating that he had given approximately 200 speeches a year during the war years.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n31">[31]</a></sup> Nearing authored a series of pamphlets, published by the Rand School, one of which, <em>The Great Madness: A Victory for the American Plutocracy,</em> resulted in his indictment under the Espionage Act for alleged “obstruction to the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n32">[32]</a></sup> This indictment came down in April of 1918, but it was not until February of 1919 – that is, several months after the war in Europe had actually ended – that the trial against Nearing and the Rand School actually commenced.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n33">[33]</a></sup></p><p>The prosecution attempted to show that Nearing, by writing against militarism, had illegally interfered with the ability of the United States government to recruit and conscript troops for its military activities in Europe. It spent its effort making Nearing admit that he had written and spoken against militarism and the war in Europe – which he was quite willing to do. But at the end of the trial, Nearing addressed the jury and made a key point:</p><p class="indentb">“The prosecution has not been able to show a single instance in which recruiting was obstructed. They have not been able to show a single instance in which insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal to duty was caused.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n34">[34]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing noted the evil implications of the government’s attempt to illegalize written dissent:</p><p class="indentb">“The only way to have intelligent public opinion is to have discussion, and the moment you check discussion you destroy democracy....</p><p class="indentb">“The Constitution does not guarantee us only the right to be correct, we have a right to be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as I understand it, and under the Constitution, as I understand it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself...on public questions.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n35">[35]</a></sup></p><p>The judge in the case, Julius M. Mayer, dismissed the first two counts of the indictment, alleging conspiracy, without sending them to the jury. Following deliberation, the jury found Scott Nearing not guilty but the American Socialist Society guilty on the third and fourth counts of the indictment. On March 21, 1919, sentence was passed and the American Socialist Society was fined $3,000 (short of the maximum fine of $10,000),<sup class="enote"><a href="#n36">[36]</a></sup> a sum which was ultimately collected through small donations from Socialists, labor groups, and civil libertarians in New York City.</p><p>The Socialist Party of America split in the summer of 1919, with a factionalized Communist movement leaving to forge an underground existence in the years after the Palmer Raids. A significant organized “left wing” inspired by the Communist International remained in the party through 1921. Scott Nearing does not seem to have participated in the factional politics of these years, although his sympathies may well have rested with the former Socialists now building the various Communist Parties. As an employee of the Socialist Party-affiliated Rand School of Social Science, Nearling remained in the Socialist Party until the end of 1923.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n37">[37]</a></sup></p><p>The dramatic decline of the size and strength of the Socialist Party in the first years of the 1920s took its toll on Nearing. The plummeting membership of the SPA – down below the 13,500 member mark for 1921 – stood in marked contrast to the new and rapidly-growing “Legal Political Party” of the Communists, the Workers Party of America (WPA), which passed the Socialist Party in size after only a few months of existence in 1922.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n38">[38]</a></sup> Nearing searched his soul in a lecture delivered in January 1923 at the Rand School, later published in the Socialist press, posing the question “What Can the Radical Do?” Nearing argued that the function of the radical was not administrative, but that of external critic.</p><p class="indentb">“The Communist radical of today will be the administrator of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be the business of the radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function as a part of the established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n39">[39]</a></sup></p><p>It was the radical’s additional function to get in touch with like-minded people in the unions, cooperatives, and in the sphere of political propaganda, Nearing added. In the unions, it was the Communist Party’s Trade Union Educational League that was currently “the liveliest thing in the trade unionism of the Middle West,” attempting at “boring from within” to radicalize the American Federation of Labor. Outside the AF of L, on the “extreme left” was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempting to found revolutionary industrial unions. Cooperators were, by the nature of their task, localized and conservative in their makeup, in Nearing’s view. Publishing was in disarray, with Charles H. Kerr  &  Co. disorganized by wartime repression and the nature of the economics of publishing such that the production of low cost books a veritable impossibility. With regards to political action, Nearing produced concrete figures to show that since 1912, membership in the Socialist Party had “steadily declined.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n40">[40]</a></sup> Nearing drew an explosive conclusion from this situation:</p><p class="indentb">“That means, if it means anything, that in the United States as it is at present organized, the radical political movements are short-lived. And if that is true, then the Socialist Party has had its day. Through the Middle West recently I found the Socialist Party almost extinct. Since 1920 it has had first the Communist Party and then the Workers Party as rivals....</p><p class="indentb">“The Workers Party has fallen heir to the present radical political situation in the United States. Is it build to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the Workers Party is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the Workers Party is weak; Moscow can dominate without any trouble.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n41">[41]</a></sup></p><p>Despite these misgivings, the potential of the growing organization appealed to Nearing over the malaise of the fading organization. Nearing finally applied for membership in the WPA in December of 1924; he was, however, initially rejected from membership, living for the next two years as a non-party fellow traveler of the organization. He finally gained admission to the Workers (Communist) Party only in 1927. Nearing went to work on the staff of the CP’s daily newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker,</em> on May 9, 1928, remaining in that position until resigning in January 1930 to publish a study on imperialism which failed to meet the ideological scrutiny of the organization. According to at least one historian, Nearing was formally expelled from the CPUSA in 1930 in connection with this decision.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n42">[42]</a></sup></p><p>In 1925, Nearing spent two months in the Soviet Union visiting schools and talking with educational authorities. “It was a fascinating experience to visit this important educational laboratory in its opening experimental stages,” he later recalled, noting that theories were then being actively tested with regards to subject matter, method of instruction, and social organization of students and teachers alike.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n43">[43]</a></sup> The result of this visit was one of the first serious studies of the nascent Soviet educational system, a book entitled <em>Education in Soviet Russia.</em></p><p>In 1927, Nearing made his first trip to Asia, traveling to China by ship for a three month stay. En route, the Kuomintang Party split, with forces loyal to Chiang Kai Shek attacking and summarily executing their former Communist allies. As Nearing later recalled</p><p class="indentb">“Leftists were liquidated on sight. The procedure was summary. When one was captured by Chiang’s forces, his arms were held by two Chiang soldiers while a third, with a sword, hacked off his head. The remains were left lying as a warning to other Leftists to follow Chiang or perish. I saw some heads mounted on poles.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n44">[44]</a></sup></p><p>While there Nearing rather boldly gave a speech at Yenching University on his book, <em>The American Empire,</em> in a room darkened so that audience members could not be later identified and denounced. Upon his return to the United States, Nearing authoring a book offering his views on the Chinese situation, entitled <em>Whither China?</em></p><p>Nearing remained a prominent figure of the American Left throughout the decade of the 1920s, producing a seemingly ceaseless series of pamphlets on various radical political themes. He was also engaged professionally on the lecture circuit, making use of an agent to arrange speaking tours for about 20 years. These speaking tours continued into the early 1930s, by which time public interest in attending live speeches and debates on political themes had waned and ill health forced Nearing’s agent into retirement.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n45">[45]</a></sup></p><p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the Nearings moved to Winhall in rural Vermont, where they had purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate sized farm for $2500. The family lived there until the coming of the Korean War in 1950. Nearing lived an ascetic and largely self-reliant life, growing much of his own food and putting up nine stone buildings over the course of his two decades there.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n46">[46]</a></sup></p><p>Feeling a sense of dignity in the common man, and wanting to serve, Nearing wrote and self-published many pamphlets on topics such as low income, peace throughout the world, feminism, and different environmental causes.</p><p>Nearing was the father of John Scott, who wrote a participant’s account of having worked in industry in the Soviet Union during the 1930s.</p><p>A consistent pacifist, Nearing opposed American participation in World War II throughout the conflict. In 1943 he was fired by the Federated Press for his anti-war position, which Managing Editor Carl Haessler criticized as “childish.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n47">[47]</a></sup>. Nearing was particularly shocked by the nuclear bombing of Japan, writing to President Harry S. Truman on August 6, 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, that “your government is no longer mine.”</p><p>In 1954 he co-authored <em>Living the Good Life: How to Live Simply and Sanely in a Troubled World</em> with his wife Helen. The book, in which war, famine, and poverty were discussed, described a nineteen-year “back to the land experiment,” and also advocated a modern day “homesteading.”</p><p>In the winter of 1956-57, Scott and Helen Nearing toured Canada, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, generating a book about their experiences called <em>Socialists Around the World.</em> The following winter, with their passports issued in 1956 nearing expiration, Scott and Helen Nearing embarked upon a trip through the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. They returned home to Maine to write a book of their experiences, entitled <em>The Brave New World.</em> The pair visited Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, Baku, Taskent, and Irkutsk, touring schools and universities, apartment buildings in the process of construction, factories, and collective farms in the course of their trip. In China they saw Peking (Beijing), Wuhan and Nanking.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n48">[48]</a></sup> The two countries were characterized in the Nearings’ travelogue as “peaceful socialist giants”:</p><p class="indentb">“The pro-peace attitude of the people of the Soviet Union and People’s China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. ‘We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialst society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation.’”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n49">[49]</a></sup></p><p>In the wake of their travels to the USSR and China, Scott Nearing seems to have drawn somewhat closer once again to the Communist Party, whose official publishing house, New Century Publishers, produced Nearing pamphlets on Eastern Europe and Cuba in 1962 and 1963.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n50">[50]</a></sup></p><p>As the Vietnam War took center stage in the mid-1960s, and as a large back-to-the-land movement developed in the U.S., a renewed interest in Nearing’s work and ideas occurred. Hundreds of anti-war believers flocked to Nearing’s home in Maine to learn homesteading practical-living skills, some also to hear a master radical’s anti-war message.</p><p>In 1973, the University of Pennsylvania formally reversed its dismissal of Nearing in 1915 by awarding him the title of Honorary Emeritus Professor of Economics.</p><p>Nearing appears in the film <em>Reds</em> (1981), as one of the many documentary “witnesses,” telling stories of his friend John Reed and of the heady days leading up to the Russian Revolution.</p><p>Scott Nearing died on August 24, 1983, just eighteen days after his 100th birthday.</p><p>In addition to working variously as a teacher, paid public speaker, and author, throughout his life Scott Nearing was a regular contributor of commentary on foreign affairs. As an octogenarian summing up his life, Nearing recalled</p><p class="indentb">“I have spent 70 years of study and travel in order to equip myself with information that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them n the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n51">[51]</a></sup></p><p>Through the years, these foreign affairs writings made use of several different channels of distribution. In 1921 Nearing was, along with his colleague Louis Lochner, a co-founder of a forerunner of the Federated Press, a news service which sent out domestic and international news releases and picture mats five days a week to the labor and radical press in America. Nearing remained a regular contributor to the Federated Press (controlled by the Communist Party for most of its existence) until 1943, when he was fired for his anti-war position, which Federated Press editor Carl Haessler characterized as “childish.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n52">[52]</a></sup> Nearing then began to contribute to an obscure monthly newsletter from Florida, <em>World Events.</em></p><p>Shortly after its founding in 1949, Nearing began contributing a monthly “World Events” column to the independent theoretical monthly, Monthly Review, established by dissident Marxist economists Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman. Nearing tellingly characterized the objective of this publication as “the dissemination of a true understanding of society and the reporting of dependable news of the movement toward a socialist society which is steadily spreading over the face of the globe.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n53">[53]</a></sup> Through the decades, Nearing wrote thousands of pages of news and commentary on these themes, retiring from this activity only in 1970, at the age of 87.</p><p>During his 1919 trial for allegedly obstructing American military recruitment during World War I, at which he testified in his own defense, the prosecution asked Scott Nearing whether he was a “pacifist socialist.” Nearing’s reply was illuminating – he replied that he was a “pacifist” and left it at that. Prosecutor Earl B. Barnes was taken aback and asked for clarification:</p><p class="indentb">Q: You are a pacifist even to class struggles?<br />[Nearing]: I am a pacifist in that I believe that no man has a right to do violence to any other man.<br />Q: Even in the class struggle?<br />[Nearing]: Under no circumstances.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n54">[54]</a></sup></p><p>Half a century later, writing in his 1972 autobiography, <em>The Making of a Radical</em>, Scott Nearing described himself as a pacifist, a socialist, and a vegetarian. In his autobiography he says “I became a vegetarian because I was persuaded that life is as valid for other creatures as it is for humans. I do not need dead animal bodies to keep me alive, strong and healthy. Therefore, I will not kill for food.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n55">[55]</a></sup> Nearing listed his four most influential teachers as Leo Tolstoy, Simon Nelson Patten, his grandfather and mother. Other influences he acknowledged in his memoirs included Socrates, Gautama Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus, Confucius, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Otis Whitman, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Victor Hugo, Edward Bellamy, Olive Schreiner, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Romain Rolland’s <em>Jean-Christophe</em>.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n56">[56]</a></sup></p><p>Scott Nearing’s journey over a century was neatly (albeit perhaps facilely) described by one biographer as follows:</p><p class="indentb">“Nearing’s intellectual development followed a path of increasing awareness of the intransigence of the dominant classes of capitalist culture to adopt reforms that would spread the enlightenment and opportunities of the leisure classes to society as a whole. From the time of his firing from the University of Pennsylvania in 1915 through the aftermath of World War I, he experienced the limits of permissible questioning of conventional wisdom. His long, difficult journey from an orthodox reformer of the ruling class from within to a complete secessionist from capitalist cultural hegemony led him by 1932 to choose homesteading – an experiment Nearing called ‘living the good life.’</p><p class="indentb">“In that spirit, Nearing moved through a series of secessions – from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the wilderness as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing’s perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.</p><p class="indentb">“In his devotion to conscientious self-reliance, Nearing emerged as a twentieth-century colleague of Emerson and Thoreau.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n57">[57]</a></sup></p><p>This view, that Nearing chose to “drop out” of politics and society itself and live life as a rugged agrarian individualist at one with nature, is a common interpretation – and certainly one with some merit. Another possible reading of Nearing’s motivations and decision-making lies in his own writing. Nearing repeatedly drew inspiration from the life story of Count Leo Tolstoi, whose life Nearing clearly saw as analogous to his own:</p><p class="indentb">“Count Leo Tolstoi is a classic example of an individual in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist social pattern and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point until the day he left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n58">[58]</a></sup></p><p>The tension between the dissident individual and the group was an unenviable one, Nearing believed. In the conflict between the solitary individual and the community, Nearing saw only three possible outcomes:</p><p class="indentb">“(1) The individual may win out and impose himself and his ideas upon the group. The normal consequence of such an outcome is a personal dictatorship or the imposition upon the community of an oligarchy in which the dissident individual or individuals play a prominent role. (2) The division of the community into factions, one of which upholds the dissident individual, with a stalemate leading to feuding, rebellion, civil war. (3) The group wins out, imposes its will and eliminates the non-conformist. Such conflict sequences have occurred repeatedly in contemporary and in earlier history.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n59">[59]</a></sup></p><p>Nearing’s chosen lifestyle of “Tolstoian,” ascetic, rural self-sufficiency may be reasonably interpreted as the attempt of a self-aware dissident individual to avoid inevitably negative participation in the internal life of the group (be it government or political party), while retaining a keen and almost obsessive interest in the dynamics of society and the world as a whole.</p><p>Allen Ginsberg, the Beat Generation poet, referred to Nearing as a “grand old man, a real mensch” in his poem <em>America.</em></p><h5>Footnotes</h5><p class="information"><a name="n1"><span class="info">1.</span></a> John A.

While those who had gone before him in the sciences of mathematics, optics, astronomy, mechanics, etc., had collected numerous observations and developed some crucial concepts, in the space of a single life-time (without getting into the dispute about share of credit due to Newton or Leibniz) Newton took some scattered observations and insights and built a theoretical system which brought within the scope of a single, rational, mathematical theory virtually <em>all</em> phenomena of the Universe. Most notably he brought within the scope of a single concept the force which caused the Heavenly Bodies to "fall" across the sky and the common-or-garden objects which we perceive and handle in our daily lives here on Earth.</p><p>The discovery of the branch of mathematics known as Calculus, which Newton helped build as did Leibniz, provided a tool of enormous power for the formulation of a mathematical view of Nature. The peculiarity of calculus is that i\' supposed derivation from lower mathematics is not (at least until very recent times) reducable to the constraints of formal logic. So while providing future generations with a wonderfully simple and comprehensive mechanical view of Nature, he also introduced a fundamental and irreducible contradiction into mathematics.</p><p>The enormous power of this view of the world has to be taken account of. Those who came after him must have felt there was little left to be done but tidy up the edges. The blow dealt to religion and the impetus given to the development of science and industry is gigantic, despite the fact that Newton remained a devout Christian to his dying day. </p><p>Nevertheless, in the political struggles of his day, Newton was the Devil incarnate or the source of all light, respective of on\' political position.

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Nietzsche, Friedrich (1844-1900)', 'glossary/people/n/pics/nietzsch.jpg', 'German philosopher, proponent of <a href="../../terms/v/o.htm#voluntarism">Voluntarism</a>, a founder of modern irrationalism and an early <a href="../../terms/e/x.htm#existentialism">Existentialist</a>. Nietzsche sought to unmask the root motives that underlie traditional Western religion, morality, and philosophy, and exerted considerable influence over all aspects of culture in the twentieth century. </p><p>Nietzsche was born in Röcken, a village in Prussian Saxony. His home was a stronghold of Lutheran piety. His paternal grandfather had published books defending Protestantism and had achieved the ecclesiastical position of superintendent; his maternal grandfather was a country parson; his father, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche, was appointed pastor at Röcken by order of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. His father died in 1849, before Nietzsch\' fifth birthday, and he spent most of his early life in a household consisting of five women: his mother Franziska, his younger sister Elisabeth, his maternal grandmother, and two maiden aunts. </p><p>In 1850 the family moved to Naumburg on the Saale River, where Nietzsche attended a private preparatory school. In 1858 he earned a scholarship to Schulpforta, German\' leading Protestant boarding school where he received an outstanding classical education, and, having graduated in 1864, went to the University of Bonn to study theology and classical philology. Despite efforts to take part in the universit\' social life, the two semesters at Bonn were a failure, owing chiefly to acrimonious quarrels between his two leading classics professors, Otto Jahn and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl. Nietzsche sought refuge in music, writing a number of compositions strongly influenced by Robert Schumann, the German Romantic composer. In 1865 he transferred to the University of Leipzig, joining Ritschl, who had accepted an appointment there. </p><p>Nietzsche began military service in 1867, where he sustained an injury, and resumed his studies in Leipzig in 1868. During the years in Leipzig, Nietzsche discovered <a href="../../people/s/c.htm#schopenhauer-arthur">Arthur Schopenhaue\'</a> philosophy, met Richard Wagner, and began his lifelong friendship with Erwin Rohde. </p><p>In 1869 the University of Leipzig conferred a PhD on Nietzsche without dissertation, on the strength of his published writings, and the University of Basel appointed him extraordinary professor of classical philosophy. The following year Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen and was promoted to ordinary professor. </p><p>Nietzsche, after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, obtained leave to serve as a volunteer medical orderly in August 1870. Within a month, he contracted dysentery and diphtheria, which ruined his health permanently. He returned to Basel to resume teaching, but ill health persecuted him. </p><p>During these early Basel years Nietzsch\' ambivalent friendship with Wagner ripened, but Wagne\' increasing exploitation of Christian motifs, as in <span class="book">Parsifal</span>, coupled with his chauvinism and anti-Semitism proved to be more than Nietzsche could bear. By 1878 the breach between the two men had become final. </p><p>Nietzsch\' first book, <span class="book">The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music</span> (1872), argued that Greek tragedy arose out of the fusion of what he termed Apollonian and Dionysian elements and that Socratic rationalism and optimism spelled the death of Greek tragedy. Greeted by stony silence at first, it became the object of heated controversy. </p><p>In 1877 he set up house with his sister and Peter Gast, and in 1878 his aphoristic <span class="book">Human, All-Too-Human</span> appeared. Seriously ill, half-blind, in virtually unrelenting pain, he lived in boarding houses in Switzerland, the French Riviera, and Italy, with only limited human contact. His friendship with Paul Rée was undermined by 1882 by their mutual affection for Lou Salomé; (mistress of Rainer Maria Rilke, and confidant of <a href="../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Sigmund Freud</a>) as well as by his sister Elisabet\' jealousy. </p><p>Nietzsch\' <span class="book">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</span>, was published between 1883 and 1885, partly at his own expense and received little attention. His attempts to set forth his philosophy in more direct prose, in the publications in 1886 of <a href="../../../reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/index.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Beyond Good and Evil</span></a> and in 1887 of <span class="book">On the Genealogy of Morals</span>, also failed to win a wide audience. </p><p>Nietzsch\' final lucid year, 1888, was a period of supreme productivity, publishing many works, including <span class="book">Ecce Homo</span>, a reflection on his own works and significance. <span class="book">Twilight of the Idols</span> appeared in 1889, <span class="book">The Anti-Christ</span> and <span class="book">Nietzsche against Wagner</span> were not published until 1895, the former mistaken as book 1 of <span class="book">The Will to Power</span>. <span class="book">Ecce Homo</span> was withheld from publication until 1908. </p><p>Nietzsche collapsed in the streets of Turin, Italy, in January 1889, having lost control of his mental faculties completely. Bizarre but meaningful notes he sent immediately after his collapse brought Franz Overbeck to Italy to return Nietzsche to Basel. Nietzsche spent the last 11 years of his life in total mental darkness, first in a Basel asylum, then in Naumburg under his mothe\' care and, after her death in 1897, in Weimar in his siste\' care. He died on Aug. 25, 1900 of general paralysis caused by syphilis. </p><p>The association of Nietzsch\' name with Fascism owes much to the use made of his works by his sister Elisabeth, married to a leading anti-Semite, Bernhard Förster. Elisabeth maintained ruthless control over Nietzsch\' literary estate, produced collections of his "works" consisting of discarded notes, such as <span class="book">The Will to Power</span> (1901), and even committed petty forgeries. </p><p>Nietzsch\' writings fall into three well-defined periods. The early works are dominated by a Romantic perspective influenced by Schopenhauer and Wagner. The middle period, reflects the tradition of French aphorists, extoling reason and science, experiments with literary genres, and expresses Nietzsch\' emancipation from his earlier Romanticism and from Schopenhauer and Wagner. In his mature writings Nietzsche was preoccupied by the origin and function of values in human life. He was especially interested, in analysing the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he saw as expressions of the ascetic ideal. </p><p>Nietzsche held that common to traditional religion and philosophy was the unstated but powerful motivating assumption that existence requires explanation, justification, or expiation. Both denigrated experience in favour of some other, "true" world. </p><p>Nietzsch\' critique of traditional morality centred on the typology of "master" and "slave" morality. By examining the etymology of the German words <em>gut</em> (good), <em>schlecht</em> (bad), and <em>böse</em> (evil), Nietzsche maintained that the distinction between good and bad was a non-moral reference to those who were privileged, the masters, as opposed to those who were base, the slaves. </p><p>The history of 20th-century philosophy, theology, and psychology are unintelligible without Nietzsche. The German philosophers Scheler, <a href="../../people/j/a.htm#jaspers-karl">Jaspers</a> and <a href="../../people/h/e.htm#heidegger-martin">Heidegger</a>, the French philosophers Camus, <a href="../../people/d/e.htm#derrida-jacques">Derrida</a> and <a href="../../people/f/o.htm#foucault-michel">Foucault</a> owe much to Nietzsche. The psychologists Adler and <a href="../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl">Jung</a> were deeply influenced, as was <a href="../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Freud</a>; novelists like Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, André Malraux, André Gide, the poets and playwrights George Bernard Shaw, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George, and William Butler Yeats, among others. Nietzsche is certainly one of the most influential philosophers who ever lived; and this is due not only to his originality but also to the fact that he was one of the German languag\' most brilliant prose writers.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> See the <a href="../../../reference/archive/nietzsche/index.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Nietzsche Reference Archive</span></a>.<br /><em>Off-site Links:</em> <a href="http://www.cwu.edu/~millerj/nietzsche/index.html">Pirate Nietzsche page</a></p>')

Born in New York, he returned there in 1962 to devote himself to a career as a folksinger, recording his first album, “All the News That’s Fit to Sing,” in 1964. His three topical albums (including “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” (1965) and “Phil Ochs in Concert” (1966) covered issues large and small, from the woes of the journalist William Worthy after his visit to Cuba (“The Ballad of William Worthy”) to the US invasion of the Dominican Republic (“The Marines Have Landed on the Shores of Santo Domingo) and the horrors of the segregationist south (“Here’s to the State of Mississippi”). </p><p>In 1967 he left New York and Elektra Records and moved to California and A & M records. These moves were significant in many ways, as he left behind the political and musical world that he had been part of for a far different milieu, and the differences are reflected in his subsequent albums. In his first A & M album, “Pleasures of the Harbor” the guitar strumming folkie is replaced with a tenor backed by huge orchestrated productions, and the biting political lyrics were replaced with long, flowing poetic pieces. This was to be the most controversial period of his artistic career, and even though he continued to sing the occasional political song (“White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land,” “The War is Over”) he had clearly – musically at least – left behind his political roots and returned to those he had kept hidden until then, those in the music of Buddy Holly and Faron Young. </p><p>Despite the musical turnabout he never really abandoned his politics, participating in the demonstrations in Chicago in 1968, testifying at the trial of the Chicago Eight, and later organizing a Chile benefit concert. But his adoption of gold lamé suits and a rock-and-roll persona led to stormy results at his concerts in the early seventies, best summed up by the title of an album never released in the US, “Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.” There are many explanations of his musical change, but not the least of them was his depression over and disgust with American politics, which he feared had taken a fascist turn, all of which he clearly expressed in interviews at the time. Perhaps as much as anything, though, it was a misguided attempt to reach a new audience.</p><p>Already all but abandoned by his former fans, his final descent towards death began with his being attacked on a beach in Tanzania, causing damage to his vocal chords. He was throwing away money he didn’t have, drinking heavily, and in his psychosis developed a new persona, that of John Train.

In the industrialrevolution most of his class saw only chaos and confusion, and theopportunity of fishing in these troubled waters and making largefortunes quickly. He saw in it the opportunity of putting into practicehis favorite theory, and so of bringing order out of chaos. He hadalready tried it with success, as superintendent of more than 500 men ina Manchester factory. From 1800 to 1829, he directed the great cottonmill at New Lanark, in Scotland, as managing partner, along the samelines, but with greater freedom of action and with a success that madehim a European reputation. A population, originally consisting of themost diverse and, for the most part, very demoralized elements, apopulation that gradually grew to 2,500, he turned into a model colony,in which drunkenness, police, magistrates, lawsuits, poor laws, charity,were unknown. And all this simply by placing the people in conditionsworthy of human beings, and especially by carefully bringing up therising generation. He was the founder of infant schools, and introducedthem first at New Lanark. At the age of two, the children came toschool, where they enjoyed themselves so much that they could scarely begot home again. Whilst his competitors worked their people 13 or 14hours a day, in New Lanark the working-day was only 10 and a half hours.When a crisis in cotton stopped work for four months, his workersreceived their full wages all the time. And with all this the businessmore than doubled in value, and to the last yielded large profits to itsproprietors.</p><p class="quote">In spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence which hesecured for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy ofhuman beings. "The people were slaves at my mercy." The relativelyfavorable conditions in which he had placed them were still far fromallowing a rational development of the character and of the intellect inall directions, much less of the free exercise of all their faculties.</p><p class="quotec"> "And yet, the working part of this population of 2,500 persons was daily producing as much real wealth for society as, less than half a century before, it would have required the working part of a population of 600,000 to create. I asked myself, what became of the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and that which would have been consumed by 600,000?"</p><p class="quote">The answer was clear. It had been used to pay the proprietors of theestablishment 5 per cent on the capital they had laid out, in additionto over 300,000 pounds clear profit. And that which held for New Lanarkheld to a still greater extent for all the factories in England.</p><p class="quotec"> "If this new wealth had not been created by machinery, imperfectly as it has been applied, the wars of Europe, in opposition to Napoleon, and to support the aristocratic principles of society, could not have been maintained. And yet this new power was the creation of the working-classes."</p><p class="quote">To them, therefore, the fruits of this new power belonged. Thenewly-created gigantic productive forces, hitherto used only to enrichindividuals and to enslave the masses, offered to Owen the foundationsfor a reconstruction of society; they were destined, as the commonproperty of all, to be worked for the common good of all.</p><p class="quote">Owe\' communism was based upon this purely business foundation, theoutcome, so to say, of commercial calculation. Throughout, itmaintained this practical character. Thus, in 1823, Owen proposed therelief of the distress in Ireland by Communist colonies, and drew upcomplete estimates of costs of founding them, yearly expenditure, andprobably revenue. And in his definite plan for the future, thetechnical working out of details is managed with such practicalknowledge -- ground plan, front and side and bir\'-eye views allincluded -- that the Owen method of social reform once accepted, thereis from the practical point of view little to be said against the actualarrangement of details.</p><p class="quote">His advance in the direction of Communism was the turning-point inOwe\' life.

Every social movement,every real advance in England on behalf of the workers links itself onto the name of Robert Owen. He forced through in 1819, after fiveyear\'fighting, the first law limiting the hours of labor of women andchildren in factories. He was president of the first Congress at whichall the Trade Unions of England united in a single great tradeassociation. He introduced as transition measures to the completecommunistic organization of society, on the one hand, cooperativesocieties for retail trade and production. These have since that time,at least, given practical proof that the merchant and the manufacturerare socially quite unnecessary. On the other hand, he introduced laborbazaars for the exchange of the products of labor through the medium oflabor-notes, whose unit was a single hour of work; institutionsnecessarily doomed to failure, but completely anticipating Proudho\'bank of exchange of a much later period, and differing entirely fromthis in that it did not claim to be the panacea for all social ills, butonly a first step towards a much more radical revolution of society.</p><p class="quote">The Utopian\'mode of thought has for a long time governed the Socialistideas of the 19th century, and still governs some of them. Until veryrecently, all French and English Socialists did homage to it. Theearlier German Communism, including that of Weitling, was of the sameschool. To all these, Socialism is the expression of absolute truth,reason and justice, and has only to be discovered to conquer all theworld by virtue of its own power. And as an absolute truth isindependent of time, space, and of the historical development of man, itis a mere accident when and where it is discovered. With all this,absolute truth, reason, and justice are different with the founder ofeach different school. And as each on\' special kind of absolutetruth, reason, and justice is again conditioned by his subjectiveunderstanding, his conditions of existence, the measure of his knowledgeand his intellectual training, there is no other ending possible in thisconflict of absolute truths than that they shall be mutually exclusiveof one another. Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind ofeclectic, average Socialism, which, as a matter of fact, has up to thepresent time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers inFrance and England. Hence, a mish-mash allowing of the most manifoldshades of opinion: a mish-mash of such critical statements, economictheories, pictures of future society by the founders of different sects,as excite a minimum of opposition; a mish-mash which is the more easilybrewed the more definite sharp edges of the individual constituents arerubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook.</p><p class="quote">To make a science of Socialism, it had first to be placed upon a realbasis.</p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../reference/subject/economics/owen/index.htm" target="_top">Robert Owen Archive</a>.</p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../o.htm">Index of the Letter O</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

After leaving school, Nurse went into journalism before leaving Trinidad to study law at university in the United States. Yet instead of returning home to become a respected professional among the small black middle class of Trinidad, Nurse became a student radical and in 1927 joined the Communist Party of the USA, becoming ‘George Padmore’ in the process. Padmore’s talents as an organiser and writer meant he was soon appointed head of the Communist International’s ‘Negro Bureau’, and from 1929 to 1933 he was a leading agitator for colonial revolution, travelling widely and residing for periods in Moscow, Hamburg, Vienna, London and Paris. As well as editing the <em>Negro Worker</em>, Padmore wrote prolifically, and his <em>The Life and Struggles of Negro Toilers</em> (1931) was particularly influential. </p><p>However, when the rise of Hitler’s Nazis in Germany led the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations and seek new diplomatic and military ties with Britain and France, anti-colonialism was no longer the central issue it once was for the Communist International. Resigning from his positions in disgust, the anti-imperialist Padmore survived a vicious Stalinist witch-hunt, and in 1935 returned to Britain. Meeting up again with his boyhood friend from Trinidad, the then Trotskyist C.L.R. James, Padmore from his base in London now steadily evolved into arguably one of the twentieth century’s most important Pan-African figures. Though close to the Independent Labour Party in Britain, and writing prolifically for its publications, Padmore never formally joined, but continued to devote his energies to the struggle to liberate Africa from colonial rule. </p><p>In 1937, Padmore formed the International African Service Bureau, later the Pan-African Federation and in 1945 was central to organising the legendary Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester. Besides writing several books from his London home, from <em>How Britain Rules Africa</em> (1936) to <em>Pan-Africanism or Communism?</em> (1956), Padmore’s greatest triumph undoubtedly came when one African disciple of his, Kwame Nkrumah, led the Gold Coast from British colonial rule to independence in 1957. Though Padmore’s experience working in Ghana as advisor to Nkrumah in the last years of his life was to be a rather disappointing one, that he lived to witness the birth of a black nation in Africa remains a vindication of, and a testament to, his life’s work. </p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../archive/padmore/index.htm" target="_top">George Padmore Archive</a>.</p>')

Following an intense, quasi-mystical experience in 1654, he became increasingly committed to the Jansenist theological movement centered at Port-Royal convent.  With his caustic <em>Provincial Letters</em> (1656-57), published under a pseudonym, he intervened on behalf of the Jansenists in the political and theological controversy with the Jesuits at the time.</p><p>Most of Pascal’s work, however, including his magnum opus, the <em>Pensées</em> (“thoughts”), was not published until after his death.  The <em>Pensées</em> is a collection of notes, ostensibly for an <em>Apology for the Christian Religion</em>, but which contain reflections on a wide variety of subjects, including the nature and limits of reason and knowledge, the sources of belief and human motivation, the meaning of the human condition, and the role and relationship of justice and force in society.</p><p>At the heart of Pascal’s social thought is the idea that often what is taken as natural is actually the result of custom and social conditioning.  So, in the <em>Pensées</em>, Pascal tries to show that there is a dialectic between true justice, which is always in dispute, and force, which is indisputable.  Being unable to “fortify justice,” we have “justified force” to ensure peace.  It is by the effect of imagination and habituation – of human psychology in certain social conditions and relations – that ideas legitimating the position of the powerful are (mis)taken for natural justice, thus stabilizing society.</p><p>Similarly, the <em><a href="../../../reference/archive/pascal/1630/three-discourses.htm" target="_top">Three Discourses on the Condition of the Great</a></em> (posthumous), demystifies the ideological foundations of feudalism by positing, before the Enlightenment and Rousseau, that all people are naturally equal; the difference between a king and a commoner is one of human establishment, not of any natural quality.

Those who possess great riches and occupy a superior social position do so by a combination of institutionalized force, historical chance, and a kind of popular misunderstanding –  not by necessity, merit or natural right.</p><p>Despite this radical critique, Pascal advises against revolution to achieve a more just social order.  Pascal’s reasoning here presents a key puzzle of his thought.  In his view of history, the dialectic between force and justice allows for no synthesis or progress, only cyclical conflict.  We do not have a clear enough view of true justice to establish it beyond dispute, so we should prefer peace and order, which we can establish.  Pascal’s experience with <em>la Fronde</em>, a series of ill-fated noble uprisings against royal power between 1648 and 1653, may also have contributed to this reticence.  </p><p>Instead, Pascal counseled a kind of lucid submission to the existing social order, and its internal standard of justice.  Although consistent with a certain tradition of Christian political conservatism, Pascal’s position is more complex.  If one is to render outwardly onto established sovereigns (e.g., kings in monarchies, the majority in democracies) the respect that is fitting to that position, one is to refrain from seeing any natural superiority (or inferiority) in those of a different rank.  Furthermore, one is to recognize that there are higher “orders,” like those governing what merits esteem or belief, which it would be tyrannical to subordinate to the political order.</p><p>This hybrid approach – radical critique with conservative prescription – offers a point of contrast with the revolutionary tradition.  But it also reflects the debate surrounding Marx’s own equivocal treatment of justice as, on one hand, the means by which modes of production judge themselves, but also, potentially, a criterion that could allow for their comparative evaluation (e.g., of why socialism or communism would be preferable to capitalism).</p><p>Also of interest in the <em>Pensées</em>, is the famous “wager” argument for believing in God.  Rather than trying to prove the existence of God, like his contemporary Descartes, Pascal argues for the rationality or advantage of religious belief.  This distinction can be seen to presage Marx’s analysis of religion’s social function.  Also like Descartes, Pascal is a dualist, in that he separates mind and body, but, unlike Descartes, he emphasizes the inexorable role of the body in the formation of beliefs, embedded in social contexts, through habit and custom.  </p><p>Pascal’s contemporary legacy is visible in diverse fields.  The “wager” has been the subject of much work in decision theory.  In the philosophy of science, Pierre Duhem, one of the founders of epistemological holism (the thesis that theories cannot be tested in isolation because they depend on other theories) draws especially from Pascal’s analysis of reasoning in <em>Of the Geometrical Mind</em> [<em>esprit</em>] (1658, but published posthumously).  And, in social theory, the critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu invokes Pascal’s account of incorporated habits and symbolic power in the shaping of collective beliefs (see his <em>Méditations Pascaliennes</em>, 1997).</p>')

He continued his education abroad at the University of Munich, studying both law and political economy. In 1912 Pashukanis joined the Bolshevik party. In 1918 he served as a peopl\' judge around Moscow, then worked as a legal adviser in the Peopl\' Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russia Republic, and soon became a vice-commissar of Justice. </p><p>Pashukani\' tour de force is his 1924 work <em>General Theory of Law and Marxism</em>, which brought him immediate international fame. The book was soon published in three editions and three languages (Russian, German, and Italian). Pashukanis was on the editorial boards of the major encyclopedias (Encyclopedia of State and Law) and law periodicals of the nation until 1930. He taught law and shaped the syllabi and text books of law teaching at Moscow University and the Institute of Red Professors of the Communist Academy. Pashukanis soon became the Director of the national Institute of State, Law, and Soviet Construction (it would be renamed several times).</p><p>Pashukani\' <em>General Theory of Law and Marxism</em> was banned in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist uprising of the 1930s, and would not be again published in the USSR until 1982 (though he was "rehabilitated" in 1956 by the RSFSR Supreme Court). In response to the Stalin supported Vyshinsky, who made "critiques" of Pashukani\'work, he was forced to publicly "revise his thinking", in 1930, 1934, and 1936. He refused however, to accept the baseless Stalinist refutations of his philosophy. In January of 1937 he was arrested, tried, and shot dead. </p><p>Pashukani\' theory stands as one of fundamental importance to understanding law, in both content and form. He explains that law (where it regulates human conduct) is created when alienation and the opposition of classes begins. He binds this closely with the emergence of the commodity form in mediating material exchanges, as humans become bearers of rights (as opposed to customary privileges) as a result of being producers in a certain class. But where Marx and Engels explained the content of law resting within political economy, Pashukanis fills out Marxist theory by exploring the forms of law. Pashukanis argues that the rule of capitalist law will largely carry itself over into Socialism, that there <em>is no such thing as worker\'law</em>, only the <em>dismantling</em> of capitalist law, as society moves from capitalism to socialism, and from  socialism into communism.</p><p>Naturally, it was on this basis that Pashukanis was attacked by the Stalinists, who believed in <em>increasing</em> the power of the state and thus the rule of law, and in building up a gigantic bureaucracy around a myriad of rules and regulations. The Stalinists attempted to argue that law is an instrument of class rule, and that worker\'should use it just as any other class has in the past -- completely misunderstanding that the essence of worker\'rule is the destruction of the state, and thus, that by enforcing and building up the power of the state, the rule of worker\'is crushed. Pashukanis emphasised that <em>the rule of law is not neutral</em>, that law is tied to political economy, and that just as exploitation cannot be class neutral, nor can law -- both institutions must be abolished during the Socialist transformation.</p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/pashukanis/index.htm" target="_top">Evgeny Pashukanis Archive</a></p>')

INSERT INTO Glossary (name, image, description) VALUES ('Paul, William (1884-1958)', 'undefined', '<p>Willie, or as he was more widely known later in life, Bill, Paul was born in 1884. He joined the Glasgow <a href="../../orgs/b/r.htm#britian-socialist-labour-party">Socialist Labour Party</a> (SLP) early on and was to become its leading Marxist theorist and tutor and later a founding member of the Communist Party and one of its key figures in the 1920s. </p><p>He was based in Derby from around 1910 or 1911 and earned a living by running a small hosiery and drapery market stall as a one-man business. This gave the necessary independence required to become a semi-professional revolutionary and was so lucrative that other stalls were opened in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Rotherham and Chesterfield. These were surreptitiously used as centres for radical literature distribution and revolutionary fund-raising. Whilst this business and the role of wandering Marxist tutor brought Paul to temporary stays in many northern and midland’s towns and cities, he was mainly resident in Derby for the rest of his life, where he was married and had one daughter in the late 1920s. </p><p>During the 1914-18 war years, at least, in common with Arthur MacManus, Paul was a close personal friend of the Derby anti-war activist, Alice Wheeldon, and her family. (MacManus regularly came to Derby in connection with the shop stewards’ movement and was a welcome visitor to the Wheeldon’s; he eventually married the second daughter Hettie.) Alice Wheeldon, who may have been involved in assisting army deserters to escape via Ireland to the USA, was imprisoned after an agent provocateur testified that she had planned a plot to poison the Prime Minister, Lloyd George! However, it seems more likely that she had sought to obtain poison to dispose of guard dogs to aid conscript escapes from army prisons. </p><p>Paul was joint editor, with <a href="../b/e.htm#bell-thomas">Tom Bell</a>, of the SLP’s journal, <em>The Socialist</em>, and enjoyed a strong reputation as a formidable Marxist lecturer and theoretician. His SLP social science classes in Derby from 1917-18 were especially well attended and have been compared by the son of a contemporary ‘student’ as having the same degree of repute as the similar approach of the Clydeside, John MacLean, in that highly complicated questions were well understood by gigantic audiences of working class people. </p><p>A book of his lectures entitled <em>The State: its origin and functions</em> was published as a result of these classes. The work clearly follows classic Marxist themes, but more interestingly draws the same or similar theoretical conclusions as <a href="../l/e.htm#lenin-vladimir">Lenin</a> was reaching at the same time, without the benefit of Paul being able to read Lenin’s work at this point, since it had not yet been translated. </p><p>Paul was also involved in Derby’s Clarion Club and in Manchester played a role in the Labour Party. No doubt his base in Manchester facilitated his contesting the 1918 election in Ince for the SLP, where he took 13% of the vote in a straight fight with an official Labour candidate. </p><p>At the time of the foundation of the Communist Party, Willie Paul lived at ‘Pen Bryn’ in what was then the village of Littleover, just on the outskirts of Derby. he was the key figure in the Derby Communist Unity group, which united local SLPers and Derby’s branch of the <a href="../../orgs/b/r.htm#british-socialist-party">British Socialist Party</a>. He was made a member of the Communist Party’s Provisional Executive Committee, having been particularly involved in the debates inside the SLP over the unity process and the nature of the new party. He was a major influence in coalescing those in the SLP who favoured joining the CPGB. </p><p>At the founding conference however, Paul displayed much of the revolutionary zeal, which the SLP had made its hallmark, by speaking against affiliation to the <a href="../../orgs/b/r.htm#british-labour-party">Labour Party</a> in a most scathing and cynical way. This was of course entirely consistent with the SLP’s view of the matter. Nevertheless, the anti-affiliationists were beaten in the debate and the Communist Party’s policy was to be for affiliation. </p><p>Paul’s Derby Communist Unity Group was one of many smaller, local societies represented at the founding Unity Convention. The national Communist Unity Group was the faction inside the SLP, which had convened a special national conference at Nottingham to win the SLP to the notion of unity of all communist organisations. The majority of the SLP official leadership expelled the CUG activists for this action but most members followed Paul and his (subsequently more famous) Glasgow comrades into the new Party. Whilst the SLP rump carried on as a shell organisation it was a mirage for decades to come and eventually faded away. </p><p>Paul played an important role nationally for some time to come in the young Communist Party. He was editor of the <a href="../../../history/international/comintern/sections/britain/periodicals/communist_review/index.htm"><em>Communist Review</em></a>, the CPGB theoretical journal from 1921-3. He stood again for Parliament, unsuccessfully, contesting the Manchester Rusholme constituency as a Labour-Communist candidate in the general elections of 1922 and 1924. It should be noted that he was bravely following Communist Party policy, even though he disagreed with it. </p><p>Paul was, thus, well known in Manchester, having had strong local connections there for at least ten years. He had often “rendered songs of the Irish potato famine” at the Openshaw BSP meetings for Harry Pollitt, later to become the long-standing leader of British Communism. Paul has been described by Pollitt’s ‘official’ biographer as a “powerful and expressive baritone”. </p><p>He polled a respectable 21% of the vote against strongly fielded Tory and Liberal opponents in the 1922 election. In the following election, he achieved much the same result, but increased the share of the vote, this time as an official Communist with Labour backing. </p><p>He then became the editor of the Communist Party inspired <em>broad left</em> journal, the <em>Sunday Worker</em>, for the short period of its existence in the late 1920s. This reached a circulation of 100,000 and was unarguably a great success for the Party, so much so that it encouraged the drive to achieve a daily paper, the <em>Daily Worker</em>. </p><p>Leaving the national stage during the period of the ‘Bolshevisation’ of the CPGB, mainly possibly to marry and bring up a daughter, Paul nonetheless remained on the fringes of Communist politics all his days. In the 1930s and l940s he was closely identified with Soviet friendship activities in Derby. During the second world war, he was much involved in campaigning work in aid of the Soviet allies in Derby and and was a prominent supporter of the Derby Peace Council in the l950s.</p><p>He was widely regarded as a man of substance in the local labour Derbyshire movement, even though he was not particularly active in his later years, some have suggested due to family reasons. A veteran Communist Party member in Derby once implied that first his wife and then his daughter were violently opposed to his politics, the latter being embarrassed by the fame that his name still possessed decades after his death. Sadly, all his papers and documents were disposed of by the family when he died in 1958 in Derby but he had foresight to leave his considerable personal library to the Party in his will. </p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/">Graham Stevenson</a>.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../archive/paul-william/index.htm" target="_top">William Paul Archive</a>.</p>')

He developed a similar conceptual approach in his studies of human behaviour.  Pavlov’s work, taken together with that of Freud, marks the beginning of modern psychology, providing the first real elements of a materialist framework for the study of the psyche.</p><p>The son of a priest, Pavlov left the seminary to enter the University of St. Petersburg, where he studied chemistry and physiology, later travelling to Germany to study under Carl Ludwig and Rudolf Heidenhain. Returning to St Petersburg in 1888, he began research on the mechanisms regulating blood pressure. His skill as a surgeon allowed him to carry out measurements on dogs without anesthesia and trace the train of nervous stimuli involved in the system regulating blood pressure.</p><p>In 1890, he became professor of physiology at the newly founded Institute of Experimental Medicine, where he remained until 1924. For most of his life from this time forward his work focussed on the action of the digestive glands of animals, in the course of which he formulated his famous laws of the conditioned reflex. (See Vygotsk\' assessment of the significance of Pavlo\' methodology in his <a href="../../../archive/vygotsky/works/crisis/psycri13.htm" target="_top">Two Psychologies</a>). Pavlo\' aim was to establish on the basis of this one body-process, the correlation between objective, measurable physiological phenomena and the higher nervous activity associated with it.</p><p>Pavlo\' relationship with the Bolsheviks after the Revolution is of considerable interest. On the one hand, Pavlov was soneone totally focussed on his science, but with a passionate commitment to pursuit of truth and a concern for precision and professionalism in his work which bordered on the obsessive; on the other hand, the Bolsheviks valued the rich inheritance of science from the old order, where science was the only way open to an ordinary citizen into high society, a practice which had created a scientific community superior to many in Western Europe. Conditions in Petrograd were desperate beyond belief by 1921-2, and Pavlov requested permission from Lenin to transfer his laboratory abroad. Lenin denied the request, and Pavlov refued personal privileges offered to him while his staff worked in near-starvation conditions. After returning from a visit to the US in 1923, he publicly denounced the Revolution, saying “For the kind of social experiment that you are making, I would not sacrifice a fro\' hind legs!” After Stalin came to power in 1924, he resigned his post saying, “I also am the son of a priest, and if you expel the others I will go too!” See his <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/pavlov.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Lecture on the Cerebral Hemisphere</span></a>, from this period. </p><p>In 1927, he wrote to Stalin, protesting “On account of what you are doing to the Russian intelligentsia – demoralizing, annihilating, depraving them – I am ashamed to be called a Russian!" In the late 1920s, he refused Nikolay Bukharin admission to his laboratory. Later on, like many others, with Russia under attack by Hitler, Pavlov moderated his criticism and got on with his scientific work as best he could.</p><p>Beginning about 1930, Pavlov tried to apply his concept of conditional reflex to human psychoses, which he saw as a mechanism to shut out the external world, in much the same way that the body protects a wound by stiffening the muscles with an influx of blood. The idea was applied in the treatment of psychiatric patients in Russia, placing patients nonstimulating surroundings to moderate the stimulus for psychosis.

Piaget regards the intellect as a system of operations derived within the subject from external object actions. Piaget’s "genetic epistemology" which showed through a study of child development how concepts and cognitive capacities are developed in a person through human activity in the course of individual growth, grasped the objectivity of concepts established in the mind through subject-object interactivity. Piaget investigated many problems of relating his work in experimental psychology to logic, biology, cybernetics and the broader development of natural science.</p><p>Piaget’s early interests were in zoology, and by the age of 15 his publications on molluscs had gained him a European-wide reputation. At the University of Neuchâtel, he studied Zoology and Philosophy, receiving his doctorate in Zoology in 1918. Soon afterward, however, he became interested in psychology, combining his biological training with his interest in epistemology. He first went to Zürich, where he studied under <a href="../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl">Carl Jung</a> and Eugen Bleuler, and then began two years of study at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1919. </p><p>In Paris, Piaget devised and administered reading tests to schoolchildren and became interested in the types of errors they made, leading him to explore the reasoning process in these young children. By 1921 he had begun to publish his findings; the same year brought him back to Switzerland, where he was appointed director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. In 1926-29 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Neuchâtel, and in 1929 he joined the University of Geneva as professor of child psychology, remaining there until his death. In 1955 he established the International Centre of <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/piaget.htm" target="_top">Genetic Epistemology</a> at Geneva and became its director. In more than 50 books and monographs, Piaget developed the theme he first discovered in Paris, that the mind of the child evolves through a series of set stages to adulthood. </p><p>Piaget saw the child as constantly creating and recreating his own model of reality, achieving mental growth by integrating simpler concepts into higher level concepts at each stage. He argued for a “genetic epistemology,” a timetable established by nature for the development of the child’s ability to think, and he traced four stages in that development.</p><p>He described the child during the first two years of life as being in a sensorimotor stage, chiefly concerned with mastering his own innate physical reflexes and extending them into pleasurable or interesting actions. During the same period, the child first becomes aware of himself as a separate physical entity and then realises that the objects around him also have a separate and permanent existence.</p><p>In the second, or preoperational, stage, roughly from age two to age six or seven, the child learns to manipulate his environment symbolically through inner representations, or thoughts, about the external world. During this stage, he learns to represent objects by words and to manipulate the words mentally, just as he earlier manipulated the physical objects themselves.</p><p>In the third, or concrete operational, stage, from age 7 to age 11 or 12, occurs the beginning of logic in the child’s thought processes and the beginning of the classification of objects by their similarities and differences. During this period, the child also begins to grasp concepts of time and number.</p><p>The fourth stage, the period of formal operations, begins at age 12 and extends into adulthood. It is characterised by an orderliness of thinking and a mastery of logical thought, allowing a more flexible kind of mental experimentation. The child learns in this final stage to manipulate abstract ideas, make hypotheses, and see the implications of his own thinking and that of others. </p><p>Piaget’s concept of these developmental stages caused a re-evaluation of older ideas of the child, of learning, and of education. If the development of certain thought processes was on a genetically determined timetable, simple reinforcement was not sufficient to teach concepts; the child’s mental development would have to be at the proper stage to assimilate those concepts. Thus, the teacher became not a transmitter of knowledge but a guide to the child’s own discovery of the world. </p><p>Piaget reached his conclusions about child development through his observations of and conversations with his own children, as well as others and was involved in numerous dialogues with mathematicians and philosophers of his day, drawing on modern research in mathemtics to inform his ideas about the structural development of the mind and criticising the un-recognised psychological assumptions contained in the work of many philosophers. He only became aware of the work of <a href="../v/y.htm#vygotsky-lev">Lev Vygotsky</a> long after Vygotsky had died, and paid tribute to Vygotsky for having anticipated many of his own most important discoveries.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em>See text of <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/piaget.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Genetic Epistemology</span></a>.</p>')

By 1880, hounded by the Tsarist Okhanara, Plekhanov fled Russia, not returning until the General Amnesty granted by the <a href="../../orgs/p/r.htm#provisional-government">Provisional Government</a>, in 1917.</p><p>In 1882, while in exile, Plekhanov rendered a Russian translation of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, with a preface written by Marx and Engels, replacing the first translation that had been made in 1869 by the anarchist <a href="../../people/b/a.htm#bakunin">Bakunin</a>, which had translation flaws. In 1883 Plekhanov helped form the first Russian Marxist organisation: the <a href="../../orgs/e/m.htm#emancipation-labour-group">Emancipation of Labour group</a>. Plekhanov renewed his struggle against <a href="../../terms/n/a.htm#narodism">Narodism</a>, pointing out flaws in revolutionary appeals to the Russian peasantry alone, and flaws in the tactics of terrorism, being the opposite of mass action; a requirment for Socialist revolution.</p><p>Throughout the 1890s the influence of the Emancipation of Labour group on Russi\' proletariat, through smuggling pamphlets into the country, built up a revolutionary following within Russia, enabling the party to be engaged in labour and union struggles in Russia. This upsurge of labour union activity, guided by the principles of Marxism which had been translated and distributed into Russia by the Emancipation of Labour group, gave rise to the <a href="../../orgs/r/u.htm#rsdlp">Russian Social-Democratic Party</a>, in 1898. The unity of this party Plekhanov would spend the rest of his life defending, save for when the <a href="../../orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-government">Soviet Government</a> was established, when he disavowed the left half of the party: the <a href="../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>.</p><p>In the late 1800s, one of Plekhano\' most passionate supporters was <a href="../../people/l/e.htm#lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>. Lenin admired Plekhanov as the founder of Russian Marxism and strove to master the revolutionary activity and party building Plekhanov had begun. In 1900, when Lenin founded <a href="../../periodicals/i/s.htm#iskra">Iskra</a>, Plekhanov wrote for the paper, and together, they supported proletarian revolution backed by Marxist theory while attacking revisionists such as <a href="../../people/b/e.htm#bernstein-eduard">Eduard Bernstein</a>.</p><p>By the time of the split in the R.S.D.L.P., Lenin and Plekhanov came head to head, never to theoretically meet again. Plekhanov wrote a book entitled, <em>What is not to be Done</em>, explaining that the party should not split, that, "rather than having a split, it is better to put a bullet in on\' brain". Lenin, on the other hand, emphasised the importance of a split, in order to develop the different trends and opinions in the revolutionary movement. The party did split during the <a href="../../events/r/rsdlp.htm#second">Second Congress</a>, forming the <a href="../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks">Bolshevik</a> and <a href="../../orgs/m/e.htm#menshevik">Menshevik</a> parties; of which Plekhanov ultimately sided with the Mensheviks.</p><p>Plekhanov theoretical position was that Russi\' proletariat should be sent to the battlefields against the Russian autocracy, and after having overthrown it, they should work to establish a bourgeois government. This would allow the proletariat to grow to a great size, while so too did the bourgeoisie, allowing a bigger proletariat class to overthrow the now more powerful bourgeoisie, believing that the proletariat would eventually overpower the bourgeois government. Plekhanov stressed that Russia <em>must</em> pass through genuine capitalistic development, in order for the conditions and tools to be built to enable a Socialist revolution to occur.</p><p>During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Plekhano\' theories were shown to be incorrect in many respects, most prominently in his negligence towards the revolutionary strength of Russi\' peasantry. Instead of revising his theories in accord with the new developments of history, Plekhanov stuck to them and defended them admist a now much larger chorus of attackers: his theories were rapidly being discarded into the dustbin of history.</p><p>During the <a href="../../events/w/o.htm#world-war-1-russia">first World War</a>, Plekhanov took what Lenin dubbed a <a href="../../terms/s/o.htm#social-chauvinist">social-chauvinist</a> stance: that German victory would be disasterous for the worl\' proletariat, but an entente victory would be much better for the worl\' proletariat. Plekhanov supported the World War, while millions of Russia\' were dying and refusing to fight, up until the Soviet government signed the <a href="../../events/b/r.htm#brest-litovsk-treaty">treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>, which horrified Plekhanov.</p><p>By the 1917 <a href="../../events/f/e.htm#february-revolution-1917">February Revolution</a>, Plekhanov returned to Russia and gave his support to the <a href="../../orgs/p/r.htm#provisional-government">Provisional government</a>, claiming it to have established a truly bourgeois government.

Proudhon was the first person to call himself an “anarchist,” the word previously only having been used as a term of abuse, during the French Revolution. He called his anarchism “mutualist socialism.” </p><p>His most famous book was <em>What is Property?</em> (1840) (“it is theft,” he responded), but his other works include <em>De la célébration du Dimanche</em> (1839), <em>De la création de \'rdre dans \'umanité</em> (1843) and <em>Système des contradictions économiques, ou philosophie de la misère</em>, (in 2 volumes, 1846). A persistent critic of the French July Monarchy, he was nonetheless surprised by the outbreak of hostilities in Paris in February 1848. In his correspondence, he recounted his participation in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed “the first republican proclamation” of the new republic. The same correspondence indicates, however, that Proudhon had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of socioeconomic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. </p><p>Determined to set the new republic on the correct course, Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, <em>Solution du problème social</em>, in which he articulated a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers that he believed would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. Pivotal here was his plan to establish a bank which would provide credit at a very low rate of interest and issue “exchange notes” that would circulate in lieu of money based on gold. </p><p>Proudhon made his biggest impact on the public during the Second Republic through his journalism. He was connected with four different newspapers: <em>La Représentant du Peuple</em> (February 1848-August 1848); <em>Le Peuple</em> (September 1848-June 1849); <em>La Voix du Peuple</em> (September 1849-May 1850); <em>Le Peuple de 1850</em> (June 1850-October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical, combative journalism which alienated some, but appealed to many French workers. In his numerous articles he criticised the policies of the government and continued to propose the reform of credit and exchange. To realise his plan, he attempted to establish a popular bank (<em>Bank du Peuple</em>) early in 1849, but despite recruiting more than 13,000 subscribers, receipts were meagre and the enterprise never took off. </p><p>Proudhon failed to get elected to the constituent assembly in April 1848, though his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon, and Lille. He was successful, however, in the complementary elections held on June 4, and was therefore a Deputy during the debates over the National Workshops. Proudhon had never advocated such workshops, perceiving them as essentially charity institutions which did not threaten the economic system, but he opposed their elimination unless some economic assurances could be given to the workers who relied on them for subsistence. </p><p>Proudhon was shocked by the violence of the June Days. He visited the barricades personally to acquaint himself with the events that were unfolding and reflected in 1855 that his presence at the Bastille at this time was “one of the most honourable acts of my life.” But in general during the tumultuous events of 1848, Proudhon opposed insurrection and preached peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. He never fully approved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May, or June, 1848, though he sympathetically portrayed the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionaries had been forced to endure, and argued that the forces of reaction were the responsible parties for the occurrence of these tragic events. </p><p>Following the June Days, Proudhon faced the criticism of conservatives within the national assembly, especially for the economic reforms that he continued to advance. Following a heated exchange within the committee of finance of the national assembly (of which Proudhon was a member), Proudhon’s proposals were condemned on the floor of the assembly by Adophpe Thiers. Proudhon responded with a three-and-a-half-hour speech on July 31 in which he argued that the abrogation of property was the essential economic meaning of the 1848 revolution and insisted that the country should “proceed with the social liquidation.” The speech was frequently interrupted by pointed rejoinders from the floor of the Assembly and was followed by a motion of censure that was supported even by Louis Blanc and Pierre Leroux. </p><p>As this vote indicated, Proudhon’s relationship with the <em>Montagne</em> was strained. Though there was a brief attempt to form a new left-wing coalition in the fall of 1848, this failed because, in Proudhon’s opinion, the <em>Montagne</em> remained attached to political revolution rather than <em>social</em> revolution. Proudhon and the <em>Montagne</em> could put aside their differences long enough to vote together on November 4 against the new constitution (though for different reasons), but by the end of the month they were again at each others throats. </p><p>Proudhon also had a run-in with the new President of the Republic, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, which led to his prosecution and imprisonment. Proudhon had opposed Bonaparte throughout 1848: he had criticised him in two articles in <em>Le Représentant du Peuple</em> in June 1848; he voted against allowing him to take a seat in the Constituent Assembly; he opposed the creation of a strong Executive elected directly by the people; he opposed Napoleon in the presidential elections of December 1848. Proudhon’s attacks became more aggressive in January 1849, and the government responded by getting the assembly to lift Proudhon’s immunity from prosecution and, in March 1849, had Proudhon sentenced to three years in prison and fined 3000F. Proudhon went into hiding for two months, although he continued to write articles for <em>Le Peuple</em>, but on the night of June 5 he was arrested and transferred to Sainte-Pélagie. </p><p>During his three years in prison, Proudhon married and fathered a son, and wrote and published four books. The first, <em>Confession \'n révolutionnaire</em> (November 1849) was Proudhon’s personal account of the 1848 revolutions. The second, <em>Idée générale de la révolution au XIXe siècle</em> (July 1851), discussed the specific the specific reform proposals that Proudhon had articulated in <em>Solution du problème sociale</em>, but placed them in the context of the inevitable historical progression toward greater liberty and equality that Proudhon termed “revolution.” <em>La Révolution sociale demontrée par le coup d'état du 2 decembre 1851</em> (July 1852), was an appeal to Louis-Napoleon to work for the revolution by implementing social reforms. <em>Philosophie du progrès</em> (September 1853), was more philosophical in nature and had little to do with the Revolutions of 1848. </p><p>Proudhon’s actions and writings during this period have always been controversial. Though clearly on the political left, his opposition to the provisional government and his public quarrels with prominent socialists like Louis Blanc made him unpopular with the <em>Montagne</em>. His attacks of Bonaparte, followed by his book urging him to embrace a progressive and “revolutionary” program, have caused confusion and led to criticism. His stances concerning politics — opposition to universal suffrage followed by election to the constituent assembly and insistence that Bonaparte institute reforms “from above” — has made it easy to dismiss Proudhon as hopelessly inconsistent. However, Proudhon did pursue a consistent social program, one that he hoped to see implemented by different parties at different phases of the revolution. His general goal was to return the control of the productive process back to workers by ensuring that workers owned their own means of production, assisted by reforms of credit and exchange. The masthead slogan of his paper in 1848, <em>Le Représentant du Peuple</em>, stated it clearly: “What is the producer in actual society? — Nothing. What should he be? —  Everything.” </p><p>Thrust into the public sphere by tumultuous events of 1848, Proudhon proved to be an ineffective political actor. As he himself perceptively noted in 1850, he was basically a “man of polemics, not of the barricades.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Proudhon’s ideas have continued to have influence up to the present day, especially in France, and the widespread movement for setting up intentional communities has its ideological roots in Proudhon’s ideas (see <a href="../../../subject/utopian/index.htm#communes" target="_top">Utopian Socialism Archive</a>).

Lecturing in Moscow, he distinguished psychoanalyiss as a theory of psychology which the Soviet Union should embrace, from the “Freudist” worldview, psychologisation, which he denounced. He corresponded with Trotsky, met with Sergei Eisenstein and had a lecture published with critical comments by Party officials. His report on the visit, <i>The Sexual Revolution</i>, praised the undermining of patriarchal authority in the collective farms but warned that the banning of homsexuality and abortion foretold the demise of the Revolution. His experience reinforced his conviction that social change had to precede psychoanalysis. </p><p>After returning to Vienna, he helped set up Revolutionäre Sozialdemokraten, a party faction aimed at preparing for armed struggle, and published <i>The Mass Psychology of Fascism.</i> While the Communist Party specualted on whether the German middle class would side with the rising Nazis, or with the proletariat, Reich was convinced that just as the elder son will always side with the father against his siblings, the German petty-bourgeoisie would side with the bourgeoisie.</p><p>In 1932, on the eve of Hitler’s triumph in Germany, he worked with Erich Fromm, Karl Landauer, the director of the Frankfurt Psychoanalytic Institute and Heinrich Meng at the Institute for Social Research in Frankurt, the beginning of the merging of Marxism and Psycholanalysis. </p><p>Reich saw sexual repression in society as the origin of psychological repression in the mind of an individual.

His first published work was <span class="book">The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes</span> (1810), asserting that there was a close connection between the volume of bank notes and the level of prices and that the level of prices in turn affected foreign exchange rates and the inflow or outflow of gold.. A committee appointed by the House of Commons, known as the Bullion Committee, confirmed Ricard\' views and recommended the repeal of the Bank Restriction Act which had obliged the Bank to withhold payment in gold under the strain of war with France. </p><p>At this time Ricardo became friends withs the philosopher and economist James Mill (father of John Stuart Mill), the Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Malthus, best known for his theory that population tends to increase faster than the food supply. </p><p>In 1815 another controversy arose over the Corn Laws. A decline in wheat prices had led Parliament to raise the tariff on imported wheat. This provoked a popular outcry and caused Ricardo to publish his <span class="book">Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock</span> (1815), in which he argued that raising the tariff on grain imports tended to increase the rents of the country gentlemen while decreasing the profits of manufacturers. </p><p>In his <span class="book">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</span> (1817), Ricardo undertook to analyse the laws determining the distribution of the social product among the "three classes of the community," namely, the landlords, the workers, and the owners of capital. He applied his findings more widely, however, and elaborated various other economic principles. He found the relative domestic values of commodities to be dominated by the quantities of labour required in their production, rent being eliminated from the costs of production. </p><p>He concluded that profits vary inversely with wages, which move with the cost of necessaries, and that rent tends to increase as population grows, rising as the marginal costs of cultivation rise. He supposed that there was little tendency to unemployment; but he remained apprehensive lest population grow too rapidly, depress wages to the subsistence level, and, by extending the margin of cultivation, reduce profits and check capital formation. He also concluded that trade between countries was not dominated by relative costs of production and by differences in internal price structures that reflected the comparative advantages of the trading countries and made exchange desirable. He treated monetary questions and especially taxation at length. Although he built in part upon the work of Adam Smith, he defined the scope of economics more narrowly than had Smith and included little explicit social philosophy. </p><p>Marx fundamentally differs with Ricardo over the Falling Rate of Profit, Ricard\' theory of rent, law of comparative cost, the concept of money and wages and profits.</p>')

Robeson’s father, a runaway slave who became a minister in Princeton, New Jersey, exerted a strong influence on the young Robeson, instilling in him a quiet dignity, a love for African-American culture, and an all-embracing humanism.</p><p>An outstanding scholar-athlete at Rutgers University in 1915-19, Robeson went on to become one of the world’s leading concert singers, stage actors, and film stars in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. During the period 1927-39, when he was based in London, his artistic growth led him to study world cultures and to support social and political movements. He sang concerts to benefit trade unions, especially the Welsh coal-miners’ union, and he came to see the connection between the struggles of the British working class and those of the oppressed colonial peoples. Robeson was introduced to socialist ideas through his friendship with George Bernard Shaw and his acquaintanceship with several leaders of the British labour Party. As a result, Robeson studied the classic Marxist writings and became attracted to the basic premises of communism.</p><p>In the early 1930s Robeson met many African students in London and developed a deep appreciation of the close links between the African and African-American cultures, learning several African languages. He also met Jawaharlal Pandit Nehru of India, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Prompted by the desire to extend his artistic range, Robeson studied many other languages and cultures throughout the 1930s and 1940s, mastering Russian, Chinese, Hebrew, and most European languages. This focus on the centrality of culture went hand-in-hand with Robeson’s increasing radicalism – a duality that continued for the remainder of his career.</p><p>Robeson responded to the rise of German fascism by becoming one of the world’s leading antifascists. Invited to the Soviet Union in 1934 by Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, Robeson was almost assaulted by Nazi storm troopers in Berlin as he changed trains on his way to Moscow. In the USSR he was deeply impressed by the lack of racial prejudice and by flourishing diverse cultures in the Soviet republics. These experiences and the communist leadership of the worldwide antifascist and anticolonialist struggles were the basis of his unwavering support for the Soviet people in their attempts to build socialism. The fact that Robeson viewed the Soviet Union and the world communist movement as reliable allies of the colonial liberation movements led him to form a close alliance with Communists despite his private misgivings about the Stalinist purges of 1936-38 and his disagreement with the Communist Left’s exaggerated emphasis on class priorities over “nationalist” priorities in the Third World.</p><p>In 1938 Robeson demonstrated his commitment to the fight against fascism by going to Spain to sing and speak in support of the Spanish Republic in its civil war against General Francisco Franco’s fascist rebellion. The profound effect this experience had on Robeson’s radicalization was reflected in his dramatic statement at that lime: “The artist must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice; I had no alternative.” By 1939, Robeson was a key figure symbolizing on a world scale the unity of the antifascist and anticolonial struggles.</p><p>In the fall of 1939 Robeson returned from England to the United States, where he continued his highly successful concert and theater career while simultaneously becoming a leader of the civil rights movement and a spokesman for left-wing causes. He was the first major performing artist to refuse to perform for segregated audiences and to lead voter registration campaigns in the Deep South. Robeson also played an important role in support of the union-organizing drive of the CIO in the early 1940s, and in bringing black workers into the unions.</p><p>In 1946 Robeson challenged President Harry S Truman’s refusal to sponsor legislation against lynching by telling him that in the absence of federal protection blacks would exercise their right of armed self-defense. An opponent of the Cold War from its inception, Robeson attended a world peace conference in Paris in 1949 and expressed the view that black Americans should not fight an aggressive war against the Soviet Union on behalf of their own oppressors. In the wake of those remarks, the U.S. government and the media launched an attack of unprecedented ferocity against Robeson that lasted for nine years.</p><p>Robeson’s passport was revoked in 1950 and was not restored until 1958. Inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of State, and numerous other U.S. government agencies compiled tens of thousands of documents on Robeson and illegally harassed him over a period of more than twenty years. Robeson was also blacklisted in the entertainment industry and prevented from appearing in professional engagements until 1957. Despite this persecution, Robeson continued to sing and speak in black churches and in the halls of the few surviving left-wing trade unions. He also wrote a book titled <em>Here I Stand</em> in collaboration with the black writer and journalist Lloyd I. Brown in which he outlined the program and strategy subsequently adopted by the civil rights movement and foretold the advent of the movement for economic justice.</p><p>During the anticommunist witch-hunts of the late 1940s and the 1950s, Robeson defended the rights of Communists and defied congressional committees when they compelled him to testify before them. Although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he refused on constitutional grounds to answer any questions concerning Party membership or affiliation.</p><p>Robeson remained publicly neutral concerning the USSR-China rift that began in the late 1950s, maintaining his cordial relations with both countries, and expressed no opinion about Nikita Khrushchev’s “secret speech” in 1956 denouncing Stalin’s crimes However, Robeson’s political attitude on these issues was conveyed indirectly by his personal friendship with Khrushchev and his enthusiastic support of Khrushchev’s domestic and foreign-policy reforms.</p><p>In 1958 Robeson’s passport was restored on the basis of a Supreme Court decision, and he traveled abroad for five years to reestablish his artistic career. After a successful comeback, Robeson became ill with circulatory disease, and in 1963 he returned to the United States to retire. Contrary to the claims of the media, Robeson was not disillusioned or embittered. As he put it in 1973, three years before his death from a stroke: “Though ill health has compelled my retirement, you can be sure that in my heart I go on singing.” Drawing upon lyrics he had made world famous, he continued, “I must keep laughing instead of crying, I must keep fighting until I’m dying, and Ol’ Man River, he just keeps rolling along.” </p><p class="fst">See <a href="../../../archive/robeson/index.htm" target="_top">Paul Robeson Archive</a>.</p>')

His was a working class family-his father was a tailor and his mother a seamstress. After attending primary school, he won an open exhibition scholarship to attend Queens College as one of the early working-class beneficiaries of concessions made in the filed of education by the ruling class in Guyana to the new nationalism that gripped the country in the early 1950s. </p><p>While at Queens College young Rodney excelled academically, as well as in the fields of athletics and debating. In 1960, he won an open scholarship to further his studies at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. He graduated with a first-class honors degree in history in 1963 and. he won an open scholarship to the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. In 1966, at the age of 24 he was awarded a Ph.D. with honors in African History. </p><p>His doctoral research on slavery on the Upper Guinea Coast was the result of long meticulous work on the records of Portuguese merchants both in England and in Portugal. In the process he learned Portuguese and Spanish which along with the French he had learned at Queens College made him somewhat of a linguist. </p><p>In 1970, his Ph.D. dissertation was published by Oxford University Press under the title, <em>A History of the Upper Guinea Coast, 1545-1800</em>. This work was to set a trend for Rodney in both challenging the assumptions of western historians about African history and setting new standards for looking at the history of oppressed peoples. According to Horace Campbell:</p><p class="quoteb">“This work was path-breaking in the way in which it analyzed the impact of slavery on the communities and the interrelationship between societies of the region and on the ecology of the region.” </p><p>Walter took up his first teaching appointment in Tanzania before returning to his alma mater, the University of the West Indies, in 1968. This was a period of great political activity in the Caribbean as the countries begun their post colonial journey. But it was the Black Power Movement that caught Walter’s imagination. </p><p>Some new voices had begun to question the direction of the post-independence governments, in particular their attitude to the plight of the down-trodden. The issue of empowerment for the black and brown poor of the region was being debated among the progressive intellectuals. Rodney, who from very early on had rejected the authoritarian role of the middle class political elite in the Caribbean, was central to this debate. He, however, did not confine his activities to the university campus. He took his message of Black Liberation to the gullies of Jamaica. In particular he shared his knowledge of African history with one of the most rejected section of the Jamaican society – the Rastafarians. </p><p>Walter had shown an interest in political activism ever since he was a student in Jamaica and England. Horace Campbell reports that while at UWI Walter “was active in student politics and campaigned extensively in 1961 in the Jamaica Referendum on the West Indian Federation.” While studying in London, Walter participated in discussion circles, spoke at the famous Hyde Park and, participated in a symposium on Guyana in 1965. It was during this period that Walter came into contact with the legendary CLR James and was one of his most devoted students. </p><p>By the summer of 1968 Rodney’s “groundings with the working poor of Jamaica had begun to attract the attention of the government. So, when he attended a Black Writers’ Conference in Montreal, Canada, in October 1968, the Hugh Shearer-led Jamaican Labor Party Government banned him from re-entering the country. This action sparked widespread riots and revolts in Kingston in which several people were killed and injured by the police and security forces, and millions of dollars worth of property destroyed. Rodney’s encounters with the Rastafarians were published in a pamphlet entitled <em>Grounding with My Brothers</em>, that became a bible for the Caribbean Black Power Movement. </p><p>Having been expelled from Jamaica, Walter returned to Tanzania after a short stay in Cuba. There he lectured from 1968 to 1974 and continued his groundings in Tanzania and other parts of Africa. This was the period of the African liberation struggles and Walter, who fervently believed that the intellectual should make his or her skills available for the struggles and emancipation of the people, became deeply involved.. It was from partly from these activities that his second major work, and his best known — <em>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em> — emerged. It was published by Bogle-L’Ouverture, in London, in conjunction with Tanzanian Publishing House in 1972. </p><p>This Tanzanian period was perhaps the most important in the formation of Rodney’s ideas. According to Horace Campbell:</p><p class="quoteb">“Here he was at the forefront of establishing an intellectual tradition which still today makes Dar es Salaam one of the centers of discussion of African politics and history. Out of he dialogue, discussions and study groups he deepened the Marxist tradition with respect to African politics, class struggle, the race question, African history and the role of the exploited in social change. It was within the context of these discussions that the book, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa was written.” </p><p>Campbell also reports that</p><p class="quoteb">“In he same period, he wrote the critical articles on Tanzanian Ujamaa, imperialism, on underdevelopment, and the problems of state and class formation in Africa. Many of his articles which were written in Tanzania appeared in <em>Maji Maji</em>, the discussion journal of the TANU Youth League at the University. He worked in the Tanzanian archives on the question of forced labor, the policing of the countryside and the colonial economy. This work — <em>World War II and the Tanzanian Economy</em> — was later published as a monograph by Cornell University in 1976.” </p><p>Rodney also developed a reputation as a Pan-Africanist theoretician and spokesperson. Campbell says that “In Tanzania he developed close political relationships with those who were struggling to change the external control of Africa He was very close to some of the leaders of liberation movements in Africa and also to political leaders of popular organizations of independent territories. Together with other Pan-Africanists he participated in discussion leading up to the Sixth Pan-African Congress, held in Tanzania, 1974. Before the Congress he wrote a piece: “Towards the Sixth Pan-African Congress: Aspects of the International Class Struggle in Africa, the Caribbean and America.” </p><p>In 1974, Walter returned to Guyana to take up an appointment as Professor of History at the University of Guyana, but the government rescinded the appointment. But Rodney remained in Guyana, joined the newly formed political group, the Working People’s Alliance. Between 1974 and his assassination in 1980, he emerged as the leading figure in the resistance movement against the increasingly authoritarian PNC government. He give public and private talks all over the country that served to engender a new political consciousness in the country. During this period he developed his ideas on the self emancipation of the working people, People’s Power, and multi-racial democracy. </p><p>On July 11, 1979, Walter, together with seven others, was arrested following the burning down of two government offices. He, along with Drs Rupert Roopnarine and Omawale, was later charged with arson. From that period up to the time of his murder, he was constantly persecuted and harassed and at least on one occasion, an attempt was made to kill him. Finally, on the evening of June 13, 1980, he was assassinated by a bomb in the middle of Georgetown. </p><p>Walter was married to Dr Patricia Rodney and the union bore three children – Shaka, Kanini and Asha. </p><p class="inline">From http://www.guyanacaribbeanpolitics.com/</p><p>See <a href="../../../subject/africa/rodney-walter/index.htm" target="_top">Walter Rodney Archive</a></p>')

He was politically a product of militant nationalism which had emerged and crystallised in the Indian National Congress towards the end of the nineteenth century. Leftism in India has been a combination of diverse strands of approaches, traditions and practices. M. N. Roy, a principal figure in revolutionary nationalism in his early years, eventually became the forerunner of Marxian politics in India. The Lenin-Roy debate on the national and colonial question continues to plague the communist movement to the present day. Roy directed from abroad the communist movement in India and sent programmes to the National Congress during its heyday of NCD and CD (Civil Disobedience). He added an operative part to the national struggle by a scheme to turn the Congress into a constituent assembly and as a state within a state to capture power in the pattern of the French Revolution. He persistently tried to radicalise the Congress and raised the slogan of alternative leadership. </p><p>Arriving in India in early 1930s he led intensive movements of workers and peasants. Before long, a cleavage developed between Roy’s adherents called the Roy group on the one hand, and the CSP and CPI on the other, on various issues, ideological and organisational. Shortly, the Left groups had to accept such courses of action for which they had castigated Roy earlier. </p><p>On the outbreak of the World War II, the Right and the Left were confused about the Congress policy, while Roy characterised the war anti-fascist and supported the allies, foreseeing that India would attain independence following the defeat of the Axis powers and inevitable weakening of the economic base of the British Imperialism. Roy was finally vindicated. </p><p>Roy had a leading role in revolutionary movements in India, Mexico, the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Indonesia and China. Like Marx he was both and activist and a philosopher; in fact Lenin called him “the Oriental Marx.”</p><p>Roy tried to organize an armed insurrection in India in 1915; founded the Communist Party of Mexico (1919) and the emigré Communist Party of India in Tashkent (1920); rose to occupy the highest offices of the Communist International and led the Comintern’s delegation to China (1927). At the same time he authored such Marxist classics as <em>India in Transition</em> (1922), <em>The Future of Indian Politics</em> (1926) and <em>Revolution and Counter-revolution in China</em> (1930); and founded the organ of the emigré Communist Party of India, <em>The Vanguard</em> (and later <em>The Masses</em>) and edited it for seven years (1922-28).</p><p>Roy broke with the Communist International in 1929 having publicly opposed the extreme left sectarian policy adopted at its Sixth Congress. Returning to India he spent six years in various prisons during which he wrote a 3000-page draft manuscript provisionally titled <em>The Philosophical Consequence of Modern Science</em>. On his release he campaigned against every variety of authoritarianism, supported the anti-fascist war, drew up a Draft Constitution for free India and the outlines of a decentralist people’s plan for economic development.</p><p>Disillusioned with both bourgeois democracy and communism, he devoted the last years of his life to the formulation of an alternative philosophy which he called <em>Radical Humanism</em> and of which he wrote a detailed exposition in <em>Reason, Romanticism and Revolution. </em>He wrote a lot of pamphlets for beginners. He was an active Marxist for the most part of his life, but he abandoned Marxist philosophy and indulged in pleading meaningless fellow-feelings among different religions of India and promoting pale humanistic thoughts. He traced morality to biological roots and suggested that human progress depended on progress towards liberty and truth. </p><p>In 1948, he launched the Radical Humanist Movement in India, which in 1952 joined with other humanist groups in Europe and America to found the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

In Marx, he wrote, two elements must be distinguished: the scientific analysis of the social relations of production within social economic formations, and the conception of Man, the agent of the history which refuses to be dominated. He dedicated himself to his role as a student of Marxism, which he understood as a return to an authentic Marx freed from the interpretation of Marxists.

May Day of 1919 was an event of enormous enthusiasm and great fear. A gigantic assembly was planned in Cleveland, in which four parades of marchers, many waving red flags, would come together in the public square to hear speeches and rally for freedom for <a href="../d/e.htm#debs-eugene">Eugene V. Debs</a> and Tom Mooney and the adoption of the 6 hour day and the $1 minimum wage. As many as 20,000 people are said to have participated in the march, with 20 to 30,000 more people lining the streets to watch. Ruthenberg later described the events that followed:</p><p class="quote">    When the head of the line was within a block of the Public Square the first trouble occurred. An officer in the uniform of the Red Cross jumped from a “Victory” Loan truck and endeavored to take a red flag which a soldier in uniform was carrying at the head of the procession. A scuffle followed in which other soldiers from the truck and some businessmen joined. During the scuffle one of these businessmen ddrew a revolver and wildly threatened the workers in the procession. In fiveminutes, however, the struggle was over. The lieutenant and his supporters were driven back to the sidewalk, the head of the line reformed, and with the red flag still flying, marched on to the Public Square.</p><p>Suddenly, the police made their appearance:</p><p class="quote">    They came down Superior Ave., which divides the “Square” into norther and southern sections, headed by the mounted squad, followed by auto load after load. The newspapers later reported that 700 men had been concentrated at the Central Statiion, who now descended upon the marchers.... The first thousand or so of workers marched onto the square and took possession of the “Victory” Loan speakers’ stand, which had been built over the stone blocks placed on the Public Square for the use of speakers at public meetings... The chairman was about to introduce [me] as the first speaker when an officer and a few soldiers tried to climb to the platform, demanding that the soldier that held the red flag give it up... [Then], without warning, a squad of mounted police dashed into the audience, driving their horses over the assembled workers and clubbing them as they went.” </p><p>A riot ensued, pitting the police and their supporters (backed by tanks) against the marchers. Two marchers were killed in the fighting, hundreds injured, and about 150 arrested in this Cleveland May Day Riot.[10] Ruthenberg was charged for incitement to murder in connection with this event but no conviction was obtained.</p><p><strong>Formation of the CPA</strong></p><p>Ruthenberg was an early endorser of the <a href="../../../history/usa/parties/spusa/1919/0500-berenberg-lwmanifesto.pdf"><em>Left Wing Manifesto</em></a> written by Louis C. Fraina and around which the formal Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party congealed. He was a Left Wing-supported candidate for the Socialist Party’s governing National Executive Committee in the party election of 1919, the result of which was overturned by the outgoing NEC ostensibly on the grounds of election fraud carried out by some of the branches associated with the party’s language federations. Ruthenberg was a delegate to the June 1919 Convention of the Left Wing Section and was elected there as a member of the faction’s governing National Council. Ruthenberg was initially supportive of the tactic of continuing to fight “to win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing” at its forthcoming 1919 Emergency National Convention in Chicago, but in the face of federation pressure for immediate formation of a Communist Party of America and the apparently hopeless task faced by Wagenknecht & Co., Ruthenberg shifted his support to the Federations and their call for an immediate Communist Party.</p><p>Dominated as it was sure to be by the Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Latvian <a href="../../../history/usa/eam/lf/languagefeds.html">language federations</a>, the anglophonic Ruthenberg was a valuable commodity to federation leaders like Alexander Stoklitsky, Nicholas Hourwich, and Joseph Stilson. Nor did Ruthenberg owe any allegiance to the idiosyncratic Socialist Party of Michigan, led by John Keracher and Dennis Batt. Therefore, the ambitious Ruthenberg made an ideal candidate to head the new organization, which was established in Chicago on September 1, 1919, as the Communist Party of America (CPA). While decisive authority on the floor of the convention and on the Central Executive Committee which it elected remained in the hands of the so-called “Russian Federations,” Ruthenberg was elected by the Chicago conclave as the first Executive Secretary of the new organization. Ironically, it was his old Ohio party comrade and prison mate, Alfred Wagenknecht who was elected to head the rival <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#clp">Communist Labor Party of America</a> (CLA) in the aftermath of the failed effort to win control of the Socialist Party at its August 1919 Convention. A period of bitter and acrimonious rivalry followed, in which both of the competing American communist organizations sought to win the favor (and financial support) of the  <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international">Communist International</a> (Comintern). Adding to the complexity of the situation, the <a href="../../../history/usa/eam/slp/socialistlaborparty.html">Socialist Labor Party of America</a> and the Socialist Party of America sought affiliation with the Comintern as well. The Comintern was adamant about its structure, however, and it sought one and only one centralized organization in each country. Merger between the CPA and CLP was demanded.</p><p>The fulfillment of the Comintern’s demand for unity proved to be no simple task, however, and the history of the next three years are a complex tale of splits, mergers, secret conventions, organized caucuses, and parallel organizations that lies outside of the scope of this presentation. In outline terms, a fight erupted among the leadership of the CPA in 1920 and Ruthenberg, together with an group of his English-speaking adherents such as Isaac Ferguson and Jay Lovestone as well as the Chicago-based section of the Russian federation, exited the organization (along with a major part of the group’s funds) in April 1920 and joined with the Communist Labor Party to form the United Communist Party (UCP) in May. Wagenknecht headed this new joint organization with Ruthenberg placed in charge of the party press.  This still left a divided Communist movement, however, with the major part of the old CPA, now headed by Charles Dirba still remaining in increasingly bitter opposition. It was not until the end of 1922 — after another merger, split, and merger — that this rift was finally resolved, with the establishment with a new unified Communist Party of America and its parallel “Legal Political Party,” the Workers Party of America (WPA).</p><p>During much of this complicated dance, C.E. Ruthenberg was in jail. In October of 1920, Ruthenberg was tried together with his associate Isaac Ferguson in New York for alleged violation of the state’s Criminal Anarchism law, said to have been breached by the Left Wing Section when it published Fraina’s Left Wing Manifesto the previous year. The pair were tried and sentenced to 5 years’ confinement in the State Penitentiary on October 29, 1920. The pair sat in Dannemora Prison until finally released on a $5,000 bond on April 24, 1922. Ruthenberg was immediately made Executive Secretary of the WPA upon his release on bail, with Abram Jakira in charge of daily operations of the parallel and underground CPA. The above ground WPA headed by Ruthenberg grew rapidly, boosted by the addition of the massive Finnish Federation to its ranks, while the underground party withered and died, put to bed for good in 1923. Thereafter Ruthenberg was the sole Executive Secretary of the American Communist Party (still calling itself the Workers Party of America) — a position which he retained for the rest of his life, despite spending much of the 1920s as a leader of a minority faction within the party.</p><p>The Criminal Anarchism convictions of Ruthenberg and Ferguson were ultimately overturned by the New York Supreme Court In July of 1922, just in time for another round of prosecutions, this time related to ill-fate August 1922 Unity Convention of the CPA held at Bridgman, Michigan.</p><p><strong>The 1922 Bridgman Convention</strong></p><p>A secret conclave had been arranged at the Wolfskeel Resort on the wooded shore of Lake Michigan to finally unite the CPA with a parallel organization maintained by its dissident Central Caucus faction. The site was regarded as relatively safe, having previously been used for a secret convention of the United Communist Party in the spring of 1920. This time, however, an informant of the US Department of Justice had managed to win election to the gathering as a delegate and the authorities had been notified.</p><p>The forced merger did not, however, end the rivalries between the two groups. Ruthenberg and his supporter Jay Lovestone were at odds with a rival faction led by William Z. Foster, who had strong ties to organized labor and who wanted to direct the party’s work toward organizing within the American-born working class, and James P. Cannon, who led the International Labor Defense organization.C.E. Ruthenberg, 1924</p><p>He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Representatives from Ohio’s 20th Congressional District (now abolished) as the candidate of the Workers Party of America, as the CPUSA was then known, on his return to the United States.</p><p>In 1925, Comintern representative Sergei Gusev ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg’s faction; Foster complied. The factional infighting within the CPUSA did not end, however; the communist leadership of the New York locals of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra-party factional rivalries, as neither group wanted to take the responsibility for accepting a strike settlement that appeared insufficiently revolutionary.</p><p>In 1926–27 his First Amendment case, Ruthenberg v. Michigan, was pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court had voted 7–2 (with Brandeis joined by Holmes dissenting) against Ruthenberg. But Ruthenberg died shortly before the Court rendered its ruling, thus the opinions in the case were never published.</p><p>Ruthenberg died in 1927 in Chicago from a ruptured appendix. He was cremated and an urn containing his ashes was placed in the Kremlin wall, not far from the burial place of his former factional rival John Reed.</p><p><strong>Writings</strong></p><p>As the head of the American Communist Party, C.E. Ruthenberg was essentially an administrator rather than a theoretician. His early journalism is scattered, he wrote relatively few pamphlets, and he published no books in his lifetime, save for a slim volume gathering his 1920 New York trial testimony with that of Isaac Ferguson, who also served as attorney in his case. A small volume of excerpts of speeches was also published by the Communist Party in 1928, shortly after his death. Nor has the CPUSA, despite Ruthenberg’s iconic status in party history, published any significant portion of his work in subsequent years. This paucity of available material has been mitigated to some extent in the internet age, with an appreciable slice of his journalism gradually becoming available online.</p><p class="inline">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ruthenberg]</p><p class="inline">[Submitted by Tim Davenport]</p><p>See <a href="../../../history/usa/eam/writers/ruthenberg.html" target="_top">C.

He held that the driving forces in history were science, morality and religion, but he did demonstrate the objective nature of the historical process and the role of property relations in its development. </p><p>During the French Revolution, Saint-Simon was close to the Jacobins. He also participated in the War of Independence of the United States of America. He subscribed to the materialist current in the Enlightenment and opposed deism, advocating the study of nature, and was one of the first to see that politics was determined by economics and he advocated he development of the study of the laws governing history as an extension of the natural sciences.</p><p>Saint-Simon was the major influence on his pupil <a href="../../../reference/archive/comte/index.htm" target="_top">Auguste Comte</a>, and the sources of Comte’s ideas are visible in the <span class="book">Letters</span>.

The Revolution was the victory of the 3rdestate – i.e., of the great masses of the nation, <em>working</em> inproduction and in trade, over the privileged <em>idle</em> classes, the noblesand the priests. But the victory of the 3rd estate soon revealed itselfas exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this “estate”, as theconquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it –i.e., the propertied bourgeoisie. And the bourgeoisie had certainlydeveloped rapidly during the Revolution, partly by speculation in thelands of the nobility and of the Church, confiscated and afterwards putup for sale, and partly by frauds upon the nation by means of armycontracts. It was the domination of these swindlers that, under theDirectorate, brought France to the verge of ruin, and thus gave Napoleonthe pretext for his coup d’etat.</p><p class="quote">“Hence, to Saint-Simon the antagonism between the 3rd Estate and theprivileged classes took the form of an antagonism between “workers” and“idlers.” The idlers were not merely the old privileged classes, butalso all who, without taking any part in production or distribution,lived on their incomes. And the workers were not only the wage-workers,but also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers. That the idlershad lost the capacity for intellectual leadership and political supremacy had been proved, and was by the Revolution finally settled. That the non-possessing classes had not this capacity seemed toSaint-Simon proved by the experiences of the Reign of Terror. Then, who was to lead and command? According to Saint-Simon, science and industry,both united by a new religious bond, destined to restore that unity ofreligious ideas which had been lost since the time of the Reformation –a necessarily mystic and rigidly hierarchic “new Christianity.” Butscience, that was the scholars; and industry, that was, in the firstplace, the working bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers. Thesebourgeois were, certainly, intended by Saint-Simon to transformthemselves into a kind of public officials, of social trustees; but theywere still to hold, vis-a-vis of the workers, a commanding andeconomically privileged position. The bankers especially were to becalled upon to direct the whole of social production by the regulationof credit. This conception was in exact keeping with a time in whichModern Industry in France and, with it, the chasm between bourgeoisieand proletariat was only just coming into existence. But whatSaint-Simon especially lays stress upon is this: what interests himfirst, and above all other things, is the lot of the class that is themost numerous and the most poor (“la classe la plus nombreuse et la pluspauvre”).</p><p class="quote">“Already in his Geneva letters, Saint-Simon lays down the propositionthat "all men ought to work". In the same work he recognizes also thatthe Reign of Terror was the reign of the non-possessing masses.</p><p class="quote">“See,” says he to them, "what happened in France at the time when your comrades held sway there; they brought about a famine.”  </p><p class="quote">“But to recognise the French Revolution as a class war, and not simplyone between nobility and bourgeoisie, but between nobility, bourgeoisie,and the non-possessors, was, in the year 1802, a most pregnantdiscovery. In 1816, he declares that politics is the science ofproduction, and foretells the complete absorption of politics byeconomics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis ofpolitical institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is herealready very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion ofpolitical rule over men into an administration of things and a directionof processes of production – that is to say, the "abolition of thestate", about which recently there has been so much noise.</p><p class="quote">“Saint-Simon shows the same superiority over his contemporaries, when in1814, immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris, and again in1815, during the Hundred Days’ War, he proclaims the alliance of Franceand England, and then of both of these countries, with Germany, as theonly guarantee for the prosperous development and peace of Europe.

He remained a loyal and active member of the Communist Party until his death in 1936. </p><p>He was the third Indian Member of Parliament (MP) in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, after fellow Parsis Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownagree. </p><p>Saklatvala was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, on March 28, 1874 the son of a merchant. A Parsi by background, he worked for his wealthy uncle’s firm, Tata Industries, but suffered from poor health and in October 1905 he was sent to England for medical treatment. Saklatvala became involved in left-wing politics and in 1907 he joined the SDF. Two years later he left to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and remained an active member and valued speaker across the country fro the next decade. </p><p>Saklatvala was adopted as the parliamentary candidate for Battersea North by the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council, in June 1921. He had just resigned from the Independent Labour Party, and had joined the Communist Party. At that time it was possible to be both a member of the Communist Party and the Labour Party at the same time. There were no bans on joint membership until 1925. Shapurji Saklatvala was elected the Labour MP for Battersea North at the General Election in 1922. He lost his seat a year later, but was re-elected, this time as a Communist, at the December 1923 election. He represented the South London constituency for five years until defeated by a Labour candidate in 1929. </p><p>Throughout all three of Saklatvala’s election campaigns, when he was the candidate of the Battersea Trades Council, the press was vitriolic in its attack on his revolutionary politics. During the 1923 campaign, Hogbin, Saklatvala’s opponent, fed information to the press—which enthusiastically followed his line—that there were ‘foreign gangs’ operating in the constituency, with the supposed aim of breaking up Hogbin’s meetings. Hogbin referred to a gang of ‘Irish rebels’, including ‘twenty gunmen’ and another of ‘continental and Russian communists’. </p><p>But it is profoundly significant that for five years, from Saklatvala’s initial adoption until 1926, there was no challenge to his candidacy from within the local Labour movement. When a challenge did come, it was in response to national influences, and not local politics, and had nothing whatsoever to do with Saklatvala’s racial origin. </p><p>Although initially the local ‘coloured’ activist John Archer and Saklatvala worked together in the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council, when the split came over the admissibility of communists, they were on different sides. Archer supported the Communists’ expulsion, and when an official Trades and Labour Council was established in July 1926, became the first secretary of the North Battersea Divisional Labour Party. He campaigned against the old Trades Council and championed Saklatvala’s Labour rival at the 1929 General Election. “Although Saklatvala and Archer were non whites operating in an overwhelmingly white Labour movement, their careers in the 1920s illustrate that politics and not race was the determining factor when it came to allegiances.” </p><p>Saklatvala faced many other pressures. His secretary, Reg Bishop, in an obituary in the <em>Daily Worker</em> wrote: “For the first year or two after his election as the MP for Battersea North, there were many who tried to get him to break from the Communist Party. The Under Secretaryship of State for India was the smallest of inducements held out if he would only be more orthodox in his politics”. </p><p>During 1926 Saklatvala was a strong supporter of the miners. After one speech made in Hyde Park he urged the army not to fire on the strikers. Saklatvala was arrested and found guilty of sedition was sentenced to two months in Wormwood Scrubs Prison. </p><p>For its continued support for Saklatvala, the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council was disaffiliated in 1926, and a few months later a new Labour Party and Trades Council was established. There was rivalry between the two organisations for a period, but by the time of the 1929 General Election the old Trades Council existed in name only. In 1927 Stephen Sanders, a long time activist in the Battersea Labour movement, was adopted as the official Labour candidate, and this effectively signalled the end of Saklatvala’s success. He lost the seat in 1929, and his vote declined even further at the election of 1931. By the time of the next General Election in 1935, in line with the Communist Party’s new strategy he urged his supporters in the constituency to vote Labour. </p><p>Saklatvala’s socialism came about as a direct result of his opposition to colonialism. He settled in Britain from India in 1905 at the age of 30 having left India, in part, because of his brushes with the British authorities. In 1909, at Manchester, where he was working as a departmental manager for Tata’s, he joined the Independent Labour Party. From then onwards Saklatvala was to spend much of his time in pursuit of his two main concerns—socialism and anti colonialism. </p><p>Although his socialist ideas, under the impact of the Russian Revolution, underwent a radical transformation, his approach to colonial freedom remained consistent. That is he constantly sought to build a united front between the workers of Britain and the forces for liberation in the colonies. This approach can be seen in one of the first Labour movement organisations to concern itself with anti-imperialism, the Workers Welfare League of India. The league was established by Saklatvala in 1917. Saklatvala was the first secretary of the League’s Indian Committee.</p><p>A number of national Trade Unions were affiliated to it, as were numerous trade union branches. At a time when support for colonialism was strong, even amongst organised sections of the working class, the Workers Welfare League of India, strongly influenced by Saklatvala’s united front approach, made some headway in breaking down barriers between the British and Indian Labour movements. </p><p>The League Against Imperialism, which was not solely concerned with British colonialism, was another body that Saklatvala was to play a prominent role in. Formed in 1927, the League drew together many of the national liberation movements. At its founding Congress in Brussels in February 1927, there were 175 delegates from 37 countries. Saklatvala’s commitment to the League led to his arrest and brief.</p><p>In a message to the founding congress of the Communist Party of India in 1925, Saklatvala had made clear his own, and the British Party’s commitment to the building of a broad anti-colonial alliance, as the way to win self determination. In pursuit of this, he then made a widely publicised visit to India, in 1927, which lasted three months and was so successful that, on his return, the British Government denied him any future access to the country of his birth. During the visit he was given the freedom of a number of Indian cities, and granted an official welcome by the Madras and Calcutta City authorities. He met and entered into a dialogue with Gandhi, later published as a pamphlet by the British Party entitled <em>Is India Different?</em> </p><p>Saklatvala also made contact with Communist groups that had recently been established. He also met Phil Spratt and George Allison, both members of the British Communist Party, sent work under cover to help organise the Indian trade union movement. Soon after Saklatvala’s visit Allison was deported back to England. In 1928 he was replaced by Ben Bradley, two years after the visit Bradley, Spratt and thirty one other active trade unionists were arrested. </p><p>They were tried at Meerut in front of an English civil servant, and after four years deliberation, the prisoners were given sentences of between three years, and transportation for life. The Meerut Conspiracy Trial received wide publicity, and because of the indignation it aroused, the sentences were later reduced, and some of the prisoners released. When Ben Bradley, whose ten year sentence was commuted, returned to England in 1933, he was met at Victoria Station by Saklatvala on behalf of the Communist Party. Continuing to play a high profile role for the Party, Shapurji Saklatvala died in 1936. </p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/">Graham Stevenson</a>.</p>')

A socialist and a communist from a young age, Samuel became a leading figure of the British New Left and a key figure in British Marxist historiography and history-writing. His contribution to the fields of British history, British labour history, British cultural history, the history of London, historiography, the history of the British Left, the history of British Communism and  in other fields of cultural history and heritage, remain vital parts of understanding British history and British labour history since the Industrial Revolution. </p><p>Samuel taught history at Ruskin College, Oxford, from 1962; a post he held until his death in 1996. In the latter part of his life Samuel was also Professor of History at the University of East London. </p><p>Samuel’s left-wing politics were developed from an early age. His mother,  Minna Nerenstein, was an active member of the British Communist Party, and instilled in Samuel  left-wing principles and left-wing values, ideas that he would carry for the rest of his adult life. Samuel himself joined the CPGB as a teenager but left the Party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Remaining a committed Marxist and socialist, Samuel went on to become a leading member of the New Left in Britain, and a dedicated socialist historian and socialist essayist.  </p><p>Until he left the CPGB in 1956, Samuel was a member of the CPGB History Group, a section of CPGB members interested in history and historical research. Samuel always maintained that the Group was vital to the post-war explosion of British history and history-writing in general, and to his own development as a historian. Despite leaving the CPGB and the History Group in 1956, Samuel remained on friendly and comradely terms with members of the British Communist Party and the History group.  </p><p>Samuel was involved in the founding of two important historical journals: <em>Past and Present</em> (founded in 1952) and <em>History Workshop Journal</em> (founded in 1976). He edited and contributed extensively to the latter, which  generated from the History Workshop Movement – a movement of historians which was established in 1967 and which was dedicated to ‘history from below’, social history, the history of everyday life, and people’s history. Samuel founded the journal through his activities as a tutor in history at Ruskin, which brought together professional historians, independent historians, adult education students, worker historians, trade union activists and other sections of the British Left. Like <em>Past and Present</em>, <em>History Workshop Journal</em> endures today as a vital historical journal.  </p><p>Samuel wrote extensively on a variety of historical subjects, but he was particularly interested in British history and labour history. His work often connected the history of every-day working-class life with wider developments in cultural, social and political history. In later life his interests expanded and he wrote, also, on the connections between history and heritage, historiography, oral history, national history, national memories, national myths, national myth-making, patriotism, crime, culture, ideology, Left politics, Thatcherism, and the history of London and the London working-class. Key books and works of his included a study of left-wing Theatre Movements (<em>Theatres of the Left</em>), a study of crime in the East End of London (<em>East End Underworld)</em>, a study of the Miners Strike of 1984 (<em>The Enemy Within</em>), volumes on British national identity, British patriotism and British national history, and numerous volumes of working-class history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  </p><p>Samuel was also highly regarded as a tutor and teacher of history, especially via his position as a tutor of history at Ruskin College. Here Samuel was involved in teaching  mostly adult education students and trade-union workers. Many of his students went on to major leadership roles in the British labour and socialist movement, and many credited him with inspiring them with a love of education and learning. His abilities as an inspirer of historical work was just as impressive as his own extensive output. Much of his later work on working-class history and working-class life, alongside several other volumes and books, remained unfinished, cut short by his early death in 1996. His educational legacy remains today in the continuing legacy of adult and worker’s education in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  Most of Samuel’s work intersected between labour history, socialist activism and education in the labour movement.   </p><p>Politically after 1956, Samuel was heavily involved in the emerging New Left in Britain and wrote extensively for the New Left Review and other New Left periodicals. One of his most important historical works was a multi-part history and analysis of the British Communist Party, <em>The Lost World of British Communism</em>, which was first published in New Left Review  between 1984 and 1987. A revised and expanded version of these essays was published posthumously in book form, as <em>The Lost World of British Communism</em>, in 2006.  The essays discussed the history of British Communism but also commented on the state of British Communism and the British Left in the 1980s, prior to the CPGB’s collapse in 1991. Samuel also published extensively in other areas, outside of academic work, especially in British newspapers, specifically on British History and British left-wing politics.   </p><p>Samuel was heavily supportive of most left-wing campaigns during the post-war era in Britain, from peace work to heritage. He was heavily involved in the creation of <em>The Partisan Coffee House</em>, a left-wing coffee house in Soho, London, which operated from 1958 to 1962.   </p><p>Personally, Samuel was married to the writer and critic Alison Light, from 1987 to 1996.

He declined the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964.  </p><p>Sartre lost his father at an early age and grew up in the home of his maternal grandfather, Carl Schweitzer, uncle of the medical missionary Albert Schweitzer and professor of German at the Sorbonne. The boy, who wandered in the Luxembourg Gardens of Paris in search of playmates, was small in stature and cross-eyed.  </p><p>Sartre went to the Lycée Henri IV in Paris and after the remarriage of his mother, to the lycée in La Rochelle. From there he went to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, from which he was graduated in 1929. Sartre resisted what he called “bourgeois marriage,” but while still a student he formed with <a href="../../people/d/e.htm#de-beauvoir-simone">Simone de Beauvoir</a> a union that remained a settled partnership in life. It was also at the École Normale Supérieure and at the Sorbonne that he met several persons who were destined to be writers of great fame; among these were Raymond Aron, <a href="../../people/m/e.htm#merleau-ponty-maurice">Maurice Merleau-Ponty</a>, Simone Weil, Emmanuel Mounier, Jean Hippolyte, and <a href="../../people/l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a>. From 1931 until 1945 Sartre taught in the lycées of Le Havre, Laon, and Paris. Twice this career was interrupted, once by a year of study in Berlin and the second time when Sartre was drafted in 1939 to serve in World War II. He was made captured in 1940, put in a prison, but released a year later.  </p><p>During his years of teaching in Le Havre, Sartre published <span class="book">Nausea</span> (1938), his first claim to fame. This novel, written in the form of a diary, narrates the feeling of revulsion that a certain Roquentin undergoes when confronted with the world of matter - not merely the world of other people but the very awareness of his own body. According to some critics, <span class="book">Nausea,</span> must be viewed as a pathological case, a form of neurotic escape. Most probably it must be appreciated also as a most original, fiercely individualistic, antisocial piece of work, containing in its pages many of the philosophical themes that Sartre later developed.  </p><p>Sartre took over the phenomenological method, which proposes careful, unprejudiced description rather than deduction, from the German philosopher <a href="../../people/h/u.htm#husserl-edmund">Edmund Husserl</a> and used it with great skill in three successive publications: <span class="book">Imagination: A Psychological Critique</span> (1936), <span class="book">Sketch for a Theory of the Emotions</span> (1939), and <span class="book">L’Imaginaire</span>: <span class="book">The Psychology of Imagination</span> (1940). But it was above all in <span class="book">Being and Nothingness</span> (1943) that Sartre revealed himself as a master of outstanding talent. Sartre places human consciousness, or nothingness, in opposition to being, or thingness. Consciousness is not matter and by the same token escapes all determinism. The message, with all the implications it contains, is a hopeful one; yet the incessant underlining meaning that human endeavour is and remains useless makes the book tragic as well. </p><p>Having written his defence of individual freedom and human dignity, Sartre turned his attention to the concept of social responsibility. For many years he had shown great concern for the poor and the disinherited of all kinds. While a teacher, he had refused to wear a tie, as if he could shed his social class with his tie and thus come closer to the worker. Freedom itself, which at times in his previous writings appeared to be a gratuitous activity that needed no particular aim or purpose to be of value, became a tool for human struggle in his brochure <a href="../../../reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Existentialism and Humanism</span></a> (1946). Freedom now implied social responsibility. In his novels and plays Sartre began to bring his ethical message to the world at large. He started a four-volume novel in 1945 under the title <span class="book">Les Chemins de la liberté</span>, but after the publication of the third volume, Sartre changed his mind concerning the usefulness of the novel as a medium of communication and turned back to plays.  </p><p>One play followed another, and all of the plays, in their emphasis upon the raw hostility of man toward man, seem to be predominantly pessimistic; yet, according to Sartre’s own confession, their content does not exclude the possibility of a morality of salvation. Other publications of the same period include a book, <span class="book">Baudelaire</span> (1947), a vaguely ethical study on the French writer and poet Jean Genet entitled <span class="book">Saint Genet, Actor and Martyr</span> (1952), and innumerable articles that were published in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, the monthly review that Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir founded and edited. </p><p>After World War II, Sartre took an active interest in French political movements, and his leanings to the left became more pronounced. He became an outspoken admirer of the Soviet Union, although he did not become a member of the Communist Party. In 1954 he visited the Soviet Union, Scandinavia, Africa, the United States, and Cuba. Upon the entry of Soviet tanks into Budapest in 1956, however, Sartre’s hopes for Communism were sadly crushed. He wrote in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> a long article, <span class="book">Le Fantôme de Staline</span>, that condemned both the Soviet intervention and the submission of the French Communist Party to the dictates of Moscow. Over the years this critical attitude opened the way to a form of “Sartrian Socialism” that would find its expression in a new major work, <a href="../../../reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/sartre1.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Critique of Dialectical Reason</span></a> (1960). Sartre set out to examine critically the Marxist dialectic and discovered that it did not exist in the Soviet Union, nor could it under the persecution of individual freedom. Although he still believed that Marxism was the only philosophy for the current times, he believed it had become rigid and fixed and that, instead of adapting itself to particular situations as it should, it compelled the particular to fit a predetermined universal, something directly opposed to the philosophy of Historical Materialism. Whatever its fundamental, general principles, Sartre believed that Marxism must learn to recognise the existential concrete circumstances that differ from one collectivity to another and to respect the individual freedom of man. The <span class="book">Critique</span>, gained little renown, however, and a projected second volume was abandoned. Instead, Sartre prepared his autobiography (<span class="book">Words</span>) for publication, for which he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for Literature, an offer that was refused.  </p><p>Combining Existentialism with Marxism, Sartre attempted a <a href="../../terms/r/e.htm#revisionism">revision</a> of Marxist theory, stating that “Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.” Sartre explained that the ultimate responsibility of all humans was first to form themselves; explaining that the effects of one’s environment and historical position were irrelevent next to the power any human has to take to their own path; and secondly that humans had a social responsibility to help society. This position, representing a view of life from a petty-bourgeois position, was directly opposed to Marx who wrote: “The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.” </p><p>From 1960 until 1971 most of Sartre’s attention went into the writing of a four-volume study called <span class="book">Flaubert</span>. Two volumes with a total of some 2,130 pages appeared in the spring of 1971. This huge enterprise aimed at presenting the reader with a “total biography” of Gustave Flaubert, the famous French novelist, through the use of a double tool: on the one hand, historical materialism and, on the other, <a href="../f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Sigmund Freud</a>’s illuminations of the dark recesses of the human soul through explorations into his childhood and family relations. Under the motto that “commitment is an act, not a word,” Sartre often went into the streets to participate in rioting, in the sale of left-wing literature, and in other activities that in his opinion were the way to promote the revolution.  </p><p>The enormous productivity of Sartre came herewith to a close. His mind, still alert and active, came through in interviews and in the writing of scripts for motion pictures. He also worked on a book of ethics. However, his was no longer the power of a genius in full productivity. Sartre became blind and his health deteriorated. In April 1980 he died of a lung tumour. </p><p>See the <a href="../../../reference/archive/sartre/index.htm" target="_top">Jean Paul Sartre Archive</a>.</p>')

In 1945, he received a degree in philosophy at the University of Moscow and, on his return to Poland with the Red Army, and a month in the Polish underground as a member of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers Party, was given the first Polish chair in Marxist Philosophy at Warsaw University in 1948. In this position Schaff, and as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, exerted his intellectual patronage in defence of Marxist orthodoxy and was considered to be the official ideologist of the Polish Communist Party, closely following the Moscow line. Schaff took a leading role in the ideological attacks on all the non-Marxist philosophical currents existing in Poland at the time. Schaff specialised in epistemology and his principal works include <em>Concept and Word</em>, <em>Problems of the Marxist Theory of Truth</em>.</p><p>After the death of Stalin in 1953, non-Marxist currents of philosophy Poland reasserted themselves, including the strong Polish tradition of studies in formal logic. In 1955, Schaff recognised that the source of the Marxist critique of formal logic was the ambiguous way in which it viewed contradiction: in Marxist classics contradiction simply expresses the fact that things and phenomena possess a “polar structure” that can be empirically identified, and the opposition between contrary forces and trends is the origin of movement and development. But <em>contrariety</em>, polarity, the opposition of forces or even the existence of two different aspects in an object are one thing; <em>contradiction</em>, as viewed by formal logic, is another. The confusion between contrariety and contradiction, he held, caused confusion on the part of the Marxists. This more tolerant attitude corresponded in the political sphere to the return to power of Gomulka in October, 1956, after a series of protests and strikes.</p><p>Polish Marxism then entered a new phase. 1956 was the year in which the so-called “Marxist Revisionism” gained strength: starting with an article by Kolakowski, its main representatives were Baczko and later Schaff, who proposed a “Marxist Humanism.”</p><p>Two different philosophical trends came to be formed in the Marxist environment: the “scientific” school and the “humanistic” school. For the former philosophy was knowledge of the world and thus epistemology and methodology, a science, based on specific sciences, whose concepts and methods it analysed using the tools of formal logic. For Marxists, this meant that its foundation was dialectical materialism, enriched with the methodological and logical progress made by contemporary epistemology. Marxism privileged the economic works of the mature Marx, Engels and Lenin, in order to throw light on their scientific nature and their agreement with scientific philosophy. This scientific Marxist trend, initiated by Krajewski, was heterogeneous: some saw it as mainly being based on the popularisation of Leninist and Stalinist ideas concerning dialectical materialism; others saw it as historical materialism, as a general interpretation of history, supplied by the leading role of the Communist Party; others tried to make Marxism more scientific by eliminating all its coarse, unacceptable elements and reconciling it with science, making it as rational as possible and in agreement with both common sense and the methodological requirements of contemporary epistemological (the Poznan School). </p><p>Schaff joined this more “humanistic” or “anthropological” school initiated by Kolakowski. This school thought that philosophy should deal above all with man and human action; it was therefore inspired by the tradition of classical German philosophy and other philosophical currents as well as phenomenology and existentialism. The aspects of Marxism privileged by this school were historical materialism and human action as the creator of knowledge in relation to social context. Although Hegelianism, existentialism and phenomenology were criticised, just as the former current had criticised neo-positivism, they appreciated its methods, which they opposed to the “positivism” of the “scientific school.” They obviously preferred the works of the younger Marx, along with those of Lukacs and Gramsci, and rediscovered authors such as Brzozowski.</p><p>Gomulka began to clamp down on this “revisionist” ferment and there was a mass purge in Poland in 1968, the year of the “Prague Spring,” and Marxists such as Kolakowski were dismissed.</p><p>The fall of Gomulka and the rise to power of Gierek in 1970 led to a gradual “de-ideologisation” of the system. The strength of the dissidents increased even more in the late ‘70s with the creation of the Workers’ Defence Committee (KOR) led by Jacek Kuron, which counted among its numbers eminent intellectuals, scientists, artists, priests and journalists. With the significant exception of the Poznan School, Marxism split up into a number of trends and positions linked to the personalities of individual scholars, increasingly independent of any orthodoxy and much more closely connected with European thought. Many thinkers embraced an anthropological interpretation of Marxism along the lines indicated by Schaff.</p><p>Schaff is currently a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and a member of the Club of Rome.</p>')

When his father died in 1805, his mother moved to Weimar, where she joined Goethe’s circle, Arthur joining her two years later, and in 1809 he entered the University of Göttingen to study medicine. Schopenhauer immediately transferred the humanities however, to study philosophy, and in 1813, he earned a PhD from the University of Jena. </p><p>Schopenhauer spent the following winter in Weimar with Goethe where he was introduced to the Hindu scriptures by the Orientalist Friedrich Majer. Schopenhauer would say that the Upanisads, together with Plato and Kant, constituted the foundation on which he erected his own system. </p><p>In 1814 Schopenhauer moved to Dresden where he completed a treatise <span class="book">On Vision and Colours</span> in 1816, supporting Goethe’s views on natural philosophy. </p><p>His next three years were dedicated exclusively to the preparation and composition of his main work, <span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm" target="_top">The World as Will and Idea</a></span> (1819), a series of reflections on the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of nature, aesthetics, and ethics. </p><p>The work argues that appearances may be comprehended, but only with the aid of constructs of the human intellect, and, with Kant, he argues that the “thing-in-itself” remains out of view for the intellect. The “thing-in-itself” however, is the <em>Will</em>, which is given to consciousness as one’s own Will. It is the Will which is responsible for the development of order in Nature and human society, but the Will brings with it only misery and pain.</p><p>The latter half of the book then deals with aesthetics and ethics, and points to the overcoming  of the will as the means of liberation from suffering. Genuine liberation results only from breaking through the bounds of individuality imposed by the ego. Whoever feels acts of compassion, selflessness, and human kindness and feels the suffering of other beings as his own is on the way to the abnegation of the will to life and the asceticism which must be the aim. </p><p>Thus it can be seen that Schopenhauer’s system is a kind of amalgam of Classical German Philosophy with Eastern asceticism. The book marked the summit of Schopenhauer’s thought and in the years thereafter, no further development of his philosophy occurred. Meanwhile, his <em>magnum opus</em> remained almost unread.</p><p>In March 1820, after a lengthy tour of Italy and a dispute with Hegel, he qualified to lecture at the University of Berlin. Though he remained at the university for 24 semesters, only his first lecture was actually held, for he continued to schedule his lectures at the same hour when Hegel was lecturing to a large and ever-growing audience. Even his book received scant attention. In 1825, he made one last attempt to find a publisher in Berlin, but in vain. He renounced his career as a university professor and lived henceforth as a recluse, totally absorbed in his studies, especially in the natural sciences. </p><p>The second edition of <span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm" target="_top">The World as Will and Idea</a></span> (1844) included an additional volume. Three publishers rejected the work, until an obscure Berlin bookseller accepted the manuscript without remuneration. However, Schopenhauer eventually achieved the recognition he desired and a third edition of <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">The World as Will and Idea</span></a>, containing an exultant preface, appeared in 1859 and, in 1860, a second edition of his <span class="book">Ethics</span>. After Schopenhauer’s sudden and painless death, Julius Frauenstädt published his complete works in six volumes. </p><p>During this time, the actual impact and influence of Schopenhauer began to spread. By turning away from spirit and reason to the powers of intuition, creativity, and the irrational, his thought has influenced via <a href="../../people/n/i.htm#nietzsche-friedrich">Nietzsche</a>, the ideas of vitalism, Dilthey’s life philosophy, Existentism, anthropology, and through Eduard von Hartmann’s philosophy of the unconscious, the psychology of <a href="../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund">Sigmund Freud</a>.

His father died when he was three, leaving his mother to support four children by taking in washing.  Shliapnikov completed primary school at age eleven and started factory work at age thirteen; he worked as an apprentice in Murom and Sormovo factories.  In 1901, he became an apprentice mechanic at a St. Petersburg metalworking factory, but was fired and blacklisted after taking part in a strike.  He returned to Murom, where he worked in a factory, improved his metalworking skills, and conducted illegal revolutionary agitation and organization.  He became a member of the RSDLP in 1901 and after the party split in 1903, he joined the Bolsheviks. </p><p>From 1904 to 1907, Shliapnikov spent a total of two years in jail or prison.  In January 1908, he left Russia for Western Europe.  From 1908 to 1916, he worked in French, German, and English factories, becoming a highly accomplished master of metalworking, participated in Bolshevik party politics, helped organize trade unions, and published newspaper and journal articles about industrial work and trade union organization.  During World War I, he served as the chief organizational link between the Bolshevik central committee abroad and Bolsheviks within Russia. </p><p>Shliapnikov led the bureau of the Bolshevik central committee in Petrograd in early 1917.  During the February Revolution, he helped organize the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ Deputies and was a member of its executive committee.  He favored formation of a revolutionary provisional government through negotiations with other left socialist parties in the soviet, but did not support the immediate violent overthrow of the provisional government.  In 1917, he helped organize the Petrograd and All-Russian Metalworkers’ Unions and was elected chair of both; he remained chair of the All-Russian Metalworkers’ Union until May 1921. Shliapnikov supported the Bolshevik seizure of power on behalf of the soviet in October 1917.  He served as Commissar of Labor until fall 1918.  During the civil war, he held important posts on the Caspian-Caucasian and Western fronts.  </p><p>In fall 1919, Shliapnikov first began to express disagreements with Communist party policy on trade unions.  His theses proposing trade union control of industry and “workerization” of leading party organs were presented to the Ninth Party Congress in March 1920.  Those who supported his views came to be called the “Workers’ Opposition.”  Alexandra Kollontai joined in late 1920.   When the trade union debate was opened in December 1920, Shliapnikov led the “Workers’ Opposition” in trying to elect to the Tenth Party Congress delegates who would vote for their theses (published in “Pravda” on January 25, 1921).  The Workers’ Opposition was only a small minority at the congress (held in March 1921), where Kollontai’s famous pamphlet about the Workers’ Opposition caused a stir.  The congress censured the Workers’ Opposition and banned factionalism within the party, but Shliapnikov was elected to the party central committee and several other important posts.  He and his supporters continued to struggle for their views, adapting them to new conditions under NEP, and they presented a letter to the Comintern in 1922 criticizing the suppression of dissent within the Russian Communist Party.  At the Eleventh Party Congress in March-April 1922, Shliapnikov and others narrowly escaped expulsion from the party for their petition to the Comintern.  </p><p>After 1922, Shliapnikov continued to participate in internal party politics, but to little effect.  He turned to writing and publishing his memoirs of the revolutionary movement, including in them oblique messages to workers about the importance of organizing themselves without depending on party intellectuals.  He briefly worked at the Soviet diplomatic mission in Paris in 1924-25.  From 1927 to 1929, he was chair of Metalloimport and in 1932-33 worked in Gosplan RSFSR.  He was investigated several times for oppositional activities in the 1920s and early 1930s, although he never joined Trotsky, Zinoviev, or any other top party leaders in any of the various large oppositions. In 1932, he was forced to publish a confession of having committed errors in his memoirs of 1917.  In 1933, he was purged from the Communist Party, in 1934 exiled briefly to the Russian north, in 1935 arrested and in 1937 executed.  He was rehabilitated of criminal charges in 1963 and restored to membership in the Communist Party in 1988.</p><p class="inline">Contributed by Barbara C.

Before the Second World War Šik studied Art at Charles University of Prague, and studied politics after the war.</p><p>Following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and the partition of the whole nation in March 1939, Šik joined the Czech Resistance movement. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 and sent to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. At Mauthausen Šik’s fellow inmates included Antonín Novotný, the future president of Czechoslovakia who was succeded by the leader of the Prague Spring Alexander Dubček, and Dubcek’s father, Stefan.</p><p>The connections that Šik made at Mauthausen proved useful in his post-war political career. In the early 1960s he attempted to persuade the harline president, Novotný, into loosening his rigid adherence to central planning, which had been crippling the economy. Šik, who by this point was an economics professor and member of the Communist party, wanted to bring market elements into central planning, to relax price controls and to promote private enterprise in the hope of kick-starting the stagnant economic climate. It was around this point that Šik was elected to the party’s central committee and was made head of the economics institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Šik’s reforms were launched in 1967, before Dubček came to power, bet were heavily watered down by party apparatchiks who worried about losing control of the factories. The only palpable, and certainly the most popular, result of the reforms was the appearance of private taxis on the streets of Prague. In December 1967, at a party meeting that was a precursor to Dubček’s coup a month later, Šik publicly denounced Novotný’s regime. He demanded a fundamental change to the Communist system and a new leadership, two decades before Mikhail Gorbachev he announced that economic reform could not be separated from fundamental political change. By this point Czechoslovakia had the lowest living standards in the Soviet bloc, whereas previously it had been the economic backbone of the Habsburg empire.</p><p>Following Dubček’s successful coup, Šik was made a deputy prime minister in April 1968 and he was the architect of the economics section of Dubček’s action programme. Šik claimed that if his policies were followed then Czechoslovakia would be on an economic par with neighbouring Austria within four years. However these plans were never followed out after the Prague Spring was brutally ended in August of the same year by the tanks of the Red army.</p><p>When the tanks rolled into Prague Šik was on holiday in Yugoslavia, with the threat of arrest looming he never returned to his homeland. Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet Communist Party’s propaganda machine singled Šik out for particular attention. In August 1968 TASS issued a press release calling him an agent of U.S. imperialism and “one of the most odious figures of the right-wing revisionists.”</p><p>Šik left Yugoslavia in October 1968 and moved to Switzerland. He became an economic professor at the University of St. Gallen in 1970, he held the post until he retired in 1990. Even after the Velvet Revolution Šik never returned to the Czech Republic, he became a Swiss citizen and lived there until his death.</p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/sik/index.htm" target="_top">Ota Šik Archive</a>.</p>')

His most famous books is <em>The Jungle</em> (1906), which brought about a government investigation of the meatpacking plants of Chicago, and change in the food laws. </p><p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a liquor salesman and drank himself to death; his mother came from a relatively wealthy family. When Sinclair was ten, the family moved to New York, and he started to write dime novels at the age of 15. In 1897 he enrolled Columbia University, while producing one poorly paid novelette per week. </p><p>By 1904 Sinclair was moving toward a realistic fiction. He read Socialist classics and became a regular reader of the <em><a href="../../../history/usa/pubs/appeal-to-reason/index.htm" target="_top">Appeal to Reason</a></em>, a socialist-populist weekly. He was never a Communist, but he was often portrayed as a violent revolutionary.

Jurgis Rudkus, the protagonist, is a young Lithuanian immigrant. He arrives in America dreaming of wealth, freedom, and opportunity. Jurgis finds work from the flourishing, filthy Chicago stockyards. First he likes his work, and is astonished when his comrades hate it. Gradually his optimistic world vision fade in the hopeless “wage-slavery” and in the chaos of urban life, and he becomes a criminal, and then a Socialist. </p><p>The book won Sinclair fame and fortune, and led to the implementation of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906.

In 1905, Sirola was appointed as Secretary of the SDP, a role which enabled him to play an active part in the general strike of that year.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> Sirola also wrote several books on social and political themes and translated works by August Strindberg and Karl Kautsky to Finnish.</p><p>Sirola was elected as a member of the parliament from the SDP from 1907 to 1909. He was forced into emigration by the Tsarist government, however, landing in America. There he worked as a professor of social science at the Finnish Socialist Federation’s Work People’s College in Smithville, Minnesota.</p><p>The March 1917 Revolution in Russia brought Sirola home to his motherland, where he again served as a Social Democratic parliamentary deputy in 1917 and 1918. He was a leader of the radical left wing of the party who supported the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 1917 and who sought to emulate Lenin’s results in Finland.</p><p>On November 11, 1917, Sirola arrived in Petrograd with his comrade Evert Huttunen, where he met with Lenin at Smolnyi about how radicals in Finland might aid the Bolshevik uprising and about revolutionary prospects in Finland.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> Lenin was fearful that troops loyal to the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky would be pulled from Finland to crush the Bolshevik uprising. He urged the Finns to initiate a general strike in an effort to emulate the Bolsheviks in their seizure of power.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> Sirola and Huttunen took the opposite impression from this meeting with Lenin than the one which the Russian leader had intended, however, interpreting the Bolshevik grip on power as being extremely tenuous and believing it dangerous for the Finnish SDP to build its plans around the survival of the Bolshevik government.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> This cautious perspective was shared by the SDP’s parliamentary group, but radicals in the party pushed the revolution forward nonetheless, calling a general strike for November 14. Sirola was one of three SDP leaders to exercise general control over the strike arrangements.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup></p><p>As one historian has noted:</p><p class="quoteb">“The instructions for the conduct of the strike required that in each community a revolutionary council would be set up with full authority over all workers’ organizations, above all the Red Guard, which was to be the executive arm of the workers’ power. The Red Guard would work with the militia in keeping order, mount guards and patrols, arrest dangerous enemies of the workers, confiscate liquor stocks, and stop the spread of rumors. The instruction ended with the standard injunction that ‘during the general strike, order and discipline must be preserved irreproachably. It must be remember that revolution is not the same as outrage and anarchy.’”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n7">[7]</a></sup></p><p>Each community experienced the general strike that launched the Finnish Revoluionary Government in a different way, ranging from complete inaction to Red Guards nailing shut the doors of stubborn businessmen who defied the strike.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n8">[8]</a></sup> The success of the action generated pressure among the working class to move to a full seizure of power in emulation of the Bolshevik seizure of power a week earlier.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n9">[9]</a></sup> Sirola still held that the armed seizure of power was premature, however. He argued at a meeting of the SDP’s Revolutionary Council convened in the early morning hours of November 16 that “the position in Russian and the eventual attack of the Germans” was decisive and that the prudent course of action was to pressure parliament into making concessions, guaranteeing action on food and granting and back wages to those who participated in the general strike action.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n10">[10]</a></sup> The parliamentary delegates taking such a cautious position were in a minority, however, and at 5:00 am the Revolutionary Council voted 14-11 in favor of seizing power.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n11">[11]</a></sup> The Revolutionary Council was reorganized, with Sirola and the parliamentary group (the minority) refusing to take part. Two hours later their nerve of the majority failed them, however, and the newly reorganized Revolutionary Council backed away from armed insurrection, in favor of an aggressive push for concessions from the bourgeois parties.</p><p>As Anthony Upton notes:</p><p class="quoteb">“In effect Sirola had won and emerged as the leading figure on the morning of 16 November; his policy, that of stepping up the pressure until they got a government that would satisfy the basic demands on food and guarantee immunity from reprisal, was adopted. On his suggestion, they decided to take over the railways, close the law courts, and compel all the agencies of central and local government to cease activity... There was also an attempt to satisfy the restlessness of the Red Guard by assigning to it a new task: It was to begin systematic searches for hidden stocks of food, if possible with the authorization of local Food Boards, but if necessary without...”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n12">[12]</a></sup></p><p>On their own authority the Red Guard began arresting and jailing bourgeois notables, however, and the drive towards revolution careened forwards. On November 18, a group of angry railway workers came to see the SDP leaders, telling party leader Kullervo Manner to his face “you have betrayed the workers, the strike must go on until a socialist government is established.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n13">[13]</a></sup> The Strike Committee met that same night and declared in favor of a socialist government and that the Red Guard must stay armed until this was achieved and “all power is taken into the workers’ hands.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n14">[14]</a></sup> The conservative government headed by P.E. Svinhufvud refused to make concessions to the socialist opposition, with parliament voting down proposals to lower the voting age and to grant the vote immediately to tenant farmers. A new cabinet was put together by Svinhufvud which did not include a single socialist, a body confirmed by parliament on November 24 by a vote of 100 to 80.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n15">[15]</a></sup> Parliamentary maneuvering was met with spontaneous armed actions by Red Guard in various localities in which some 34 people were killed, mostly victims of Red Guard violence. This increasing hostility created an impenetrable barrier between the two sides. With the conservative parliamentary majority intent upon disarming the Red Guards and establishing a monarchical form of government, the nation descended into civil war.</p><p>On January 19, 1918, a pitched battle broke out between Red Guards and the conservative Protective Corps of Viipuri, which Russian troops coming to the aid of their allies in the fight. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n16">[16]</a></sup> Fighting spread with the Red Guards beginning the seizure of Helsinki on the night of January 27/28.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n17">[17]</a></sup> White forces headed by General Carl Mannerheim controlled the northernmost five-sixths of Finland, while the Reds controlled the Southernmost region, containing approximately half of the country’s population and including the cities of Pori, Turku, Tampere, Riihimäki, Helsinki, Kotka, and Viipuri.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n18">[18]</a></sup> A Finnish Revolutionary Government was declared, in which Sirola served as Commissar of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>The civil war proved to be a one-sided affair, with the superior officer corps and materiel of the White forces under Mannerheim winning the day. By the spring of 1918, with the Red government clearly on the road to military defeat at the hands of the Whites, Sirola coordinated the evacuation of the leadership of the revolutionary government. On April 7, a meeting of Finnish socialists took place in Petrograd, at which various settlement plans were discussed, with Sirola setting up an office in Petrograd to look after the refugees already beginning to arrive three days later.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n19">[19]</a></sup> Evacuation became official policy on April 14, 1918. Historian Anthony Upton notes</p><p class="quoteb">“The choices before the socialist leaders were unconditional surrender, a glorious fight to the finish in Finland ending in almost certain martyrdom, or a prudent withdrawal with a view to a future return. It was not a difficult choice to make, and did not mean, as their detractors had always claimed, that they were weak and cowardly men who betrayed their faithful but deluded followers. They were Marxists, and could see their defeat as only an episode in the class war, which always continued, and their duty was not to indulge in glorious gestures of defiance, but to persevere in the struggle.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n20">[20]</a></sup></p><p>The Finnish Socialist Republic finally fell on May 15, 1918.</p><p>Sirola was involved in establishing the Finnish Communist Party at the end of August 1918 in Moscow.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n21">[21]</a></sup> The governing Central Committee of this new organization established itself in Petrograd, where it launched a daily newspaper and magazines in Finnish and Swedish and put into print over 40 pamphlets during its first year.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n22">[22]</a></sup> Underground organizations of this new party were established inside Finland, where they distributed literature and conducted propaganda work.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n23">[23]</a></sup></p><p>In January 1919, he was the Finnish CP’s signatory to the call for the formation of the Communist International and in March of that year he was a delegate to the founding convention, held early in March 1919.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n24">[24]</a></sup> At the founding convention of the Comintern, Sirola delivered the report on the Finnish revolution:</p><p class="indentb">“Although not adequately prepared politically or militarily for such a struggle, the workers held their ground at the front for three months, while at the same time doing a great deal behind the lines to organize social and economic life.</p><p class="indentb">“That first revolution by the Finnish proletariat was defeated. The willingness to sacrifice and the courage of the comrades, men and women, who fought in the Red Guard and the invaluable aid given by our Russian comrades were not enough to repel the onslaught launched by the international gangs of White Guards led by Finnish, Swedish, German, and Russian officers. At the end of April, German imperialism tipped the balance by committing regular army troops to the fight. The White Guards were then able to block the plan to evacuate the revolution’s best surviving forces to Russia.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n25">[25]</a></sup></p><p>In the wake of the Finnish uprising and its bloody aftermath, in which over 11,000 prisoners of the victorious Whites died of starvation, disease, or execution,<sup class="enote"><a href="#n26">[26]</a></sup> Sirola had clearly cast his lot with revolutionary methods as opposed to parliamentarism:</p><p class="indentb">“For too long, we...were imbued with the ideology of a ‘united’ workers’ movement. Only after the revolution did the split become unavoidable. There was a sharp polarization. The bourgeois dictatorship in Finland gave the extreme right wing of the old Social Democracy ‘freedom’ of organization and of the press for the express purpose of pacifying the workers. These traitors did their best to defeat the revolution the Finnish proletariat had made the previous year and to propagandize for a peaceful workers’ movement functioning through parliament, trade unions, and cooperatives.... But the admonitions of those bourgeois lackeys are alien to the masses, who are tormented by prison, hunger, and poverty. The workers’ memories of the White Terror are still fresh, and they can see the living example of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia.”<sup class="enote"><a href="#n27">[27]</a></sup></p><p>Sirola also represented the Finnish party at the meetings of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI).

Regarded as founder of classical economics, Smith was the first to complete a comprehensive theory of political economy. Smith saw labour as the sole source and <em>measure</em> of value:</p><p class="quote">Labour is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. The real price of everything, what everything costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What everything is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who want to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. ... Labour alone, therefore, never varying its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all time and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only.</p><p class="inline"><span class="book"><a href="../../../reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/index.htm" target="_top">The Wealth of Nations</a></span>, 1776</p><p>Adam Smith first formulated the view that the value of goods wasdetermined not by their use value but by their exchange value. Accordingto this concept, the market price adjusts to the cost price. Adam Smith opposed state intervention(tariffs, import or export barriers, etc.). His theory of free trade represented the rising bourgeois class, against the backwards feudalist mentality heralded by the old aristocracy. He wasa major influence on economic policy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.</p><p>A life-long friend of David Hume and part of the "Scottish Enlightenment", Smith was also acquainted with Voltaire and others of the French Enlightenment. Smith explained that he came to the theory of political economy expressed in <span class="book">The Wealth of Nations</span> from a study of "human nature" and consideration of how the innate passions of human beings became transformed into socially productive cooperation in <em>laissez faire</em> capitalism. He developed a "four stage" theory of history tracing how social institutions respond to development of the productive forces and culminate in pre-Industrial Revolution capitalism. Consistent with the theory of knowledge of David Hume, Smith regards value to be exclusively the product of human labour, which in turn has its source in human nature. The institutions of society and the division of labour arise historically independently of the will and understanding of human beings, but as the natural outcome of the clash of their individualism. Smith wrote in the very earliest days of the industrial revolution, but it was not the large, industrial enterprises which formed the context of his thinking, but rather, Smith was a representative of the small-scale manufacturer of the early eighteenth century. </p><p class="fst"><em> See: </em> <strong><a href="../../../reference/archive/smith-adam/index.htm" target="_top">Adam Smith Reference Archive </a></strong></p>')

Spinoza did not publish his main work, <span class="book">Ethics</span>, for fear of repression.  <em>Further Reading:</em> Ilyenko\' <a href="../../../archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essay2.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Essays from the History of Dialectics</span></a>.</p><p>Benedicto Spinoza was born in Amsterdam in 1632 of Portuguese Jewish parents who had fled to the religious freedom of the Dutch Republic of Jan de Witt. In July 1656, young Bento was the leader of a philosophical discussion group which included members of the more liberal-minded Protestant sects, and was expelled from the local Jewish community for his heretical views. </p><p>Descarte\'works were widely discussed in the Netherlands at that time, though Cartesian views were proscribed by the Church, and the young Spinoza was clearly influenced by Descartes. Spinoza probably attended lectures in Cartesian philosophy in Leiden between 1656 and 1659. In 1663 he published a "geometrical" version of Descartes Principles of Philosophy (i.e., a version rendering Descarte\'work into the form of axioms and theorems). However, Spinoza had already sharply departed from Descarte\'view. </p><p>Spinoza denied the immortality of the soul, and believed in a God who <em>manifests</em> himself only in the laws of Nature, rather than in a anthropomorphic entity which <em>creates</em> nature. In reading Spinoza, it is probably correct to substitute the word "<em>Nature</em>" wherever the word "<em>God</em>" is written. This view is, in fact, a world-view which would be shared by large numbers of scientifically-minded people today. </p><p>Spinoza was intensely interested in natural science, corresponding with Robert Boyle (the founder of the physics of fluids), Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society in respect of Descarte\'theory of comets and planets, Huygens on the wave properties of light including his own experiments with lenses and was widely read in physics, astronomy, chemistry and anatomy. </p><p>In 1665, Spinoza laid aside his work on the <span class="book">Ethics</span>, to write a book defending freedom of speech and religion against the 'stric\'Calvinists. The <span class="book">Treatise on Theology and Politics</span> asserted that the Bible should not be regarded as containing scientific or philosophical truth, but was the work of human beings and should be regarded as an historical document, which teaches obedience to a certain moral code. </p><p>The Calvinists were furious, to say the least. The Synod of South Holland referred to the <span class="book">Treatise</span> as an 'evil and blasphemous boo\'and it was anonymously described as 'spawned in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil'. </p><p>When the French invaded the Republic, and Jan de Witt was beaten to death by a Calvinist mob in The Hague, Spinoza had to keep a low profile. The <span class="book">Ethics </span>was completed in 1675, but it was not published until after Spinoz\' death in 1677. </p><p>Spinoz\' principal amendment to Descarte\'theory was that he eliminates the problem of the "coordination" of extension-less thought and unconscious matter (Descarte\'"dualism") by proposing a world made up of "Substance" which has attributes of both extension and thought. Thus "Nature thinks itself", and the problem of "coordination" does not arise. Spinoza was thus the first to offer a solution to the "subject-object" problem, the first "Monist".</p><p>Further, Spinoza is a <a href="../../terms/r/a.htm#rationalism">Rationalist</a>, in the sense that he appeals to the "clear light of Reason" rather than to the evidence of the senses, and a Logicist in that he proposes that any theory should be developed by formal-logical proof from axioms, modelled on the only science to have by then achieved the status of genuine science - <em>geometry</em>, and mathematics in general. </p><p>Spinoza must be regarded as a <a href="../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism">Materialist</a>, as for him thought is but an attribute of objectively existing Substance; Substance may or may exhibit the attribute of thought. In line with the development of positive science at that time, his view of the material world is exclusively <a href="../../terms/m/e.htm#mechanical-materialism">Mechanical</a>, and the world unfolds with determined necessity. Human freedom is expressed by the fact that through knowledge of God (i.e. Nature and its laws) - people are conscious agents, participants in events, not subject to "outside" events. </p><p>Spinoza was a contemporary of the British <a href="../../terms/e/m.htm#empiricism">Empiricists</a>, Hobbes and Locke; his predecessors were Descartes and Galileo; Isaac Newton was a young man when Spinoza died of consumption in 1677. Although he is in many ways 250 years ahead of his time, Spinoz\' work remained more or less obscure until the great German poet, Goethe, promoted and extended Spinoz\' naturalistic, "pantheistic" views in the late eighteenth century, and Haeckel and Einstein were among his admirers.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../reference/archive/spinoza/index.htm" target="_top">Spinoza Archive</a>.</p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../s.htm">Index of the Letter S</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

He held that workers could be forced to put the maximum effort into work by a combination of motivating them with higher wages, financed on the basis of higher productivity, and most significantly, by closely monitoring the worker’s every movement so that it was impossible to go slow without detection. In order to achieve the maximum productivity, Taylor proposed that instead of reducing the number of "unproductive" workers to a minimum, about 25% of all employees should be dedicated to supervising, monitoring, measuring and accounting. This was the beginning of the stratification of the working class into more and more layers of supervisory, administrative and technical workers, enjoying privieleges over and above the "blue-collar" trades they supervised.</p><p>The symbol of Taylor’s management methods was the stop-watch, ever-present as supervisors conducted "Time and Motion Studies", timing every hand-movement, every step, every breath a worker made.

At the age of eighteen she married John Taylor, a wealthy businessman from Islington. In the next few years Harriet had three children. </p><p>John and Harriet Taylor both became active in the Unitarian Church and developed radical views on politics. They became friendly with William Fox, a leading Unitarian minister and early supporter of women’s rights. Harriet Taylor moved in radical circles and in 1830 she met the philosopher John Stuart Mill. Taylor was attracted to Mill, the first man she had met who treated her as an intellectual equal. Mill was impressed with Taylor and asked her to read and comment on the latest book he was working on. </p><p>Harriet Taylor’s relationship with her husband began to deteriorate and in 1833 he agreed to a trial separation. Harriet moved to a house at Walton-on-Thames where John Start Mill visited her at weekends. Although Harriet Taylor and Mill claimed they were not having a sexual relationship, their behaviour scandalized their friends. As a result, the couple became socially isolated.</p><p>Over the next few years Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill exchanged essays on issues such as marriage and women’s rights. Those essays that have survived reveal that Taylor held more radical views than Mill on these subjects. Taylor was attracted to the socialist philosophy that had been promoted by Robert Owen in books such as The Formation of Character (1813) and A New View of Society (1814). In her essays Taylor was especially critical of the degrading effect of women’s economic dependence on men. Taylor thought this situation could only be changed by the radical reform of all marriage laws. Although Mill shared Taylor’s belief in equal rights, he favoured laws that gave women equality rather than independence.</p><p>Except for a few articles in the Unitarian journal Monthly Repository, Taylor published little of her own work during her lifetime. However, Taylor read and commented on all the material produced by John Stuart Mill. In his autobiography, Mill claimed that Harriet was the joint author of most of the books and articles that were published under his name. He added, “when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen.”</p><p>In 1848 John Stuart Mill’s Principles of Political Economy was published. Mill planned to include details of the role that Taylor had played in the production of the book, but when John Taylor heard about this he objected and references to his wife were removed. However, in his autobiography, Mill pointed out that Principles of Political Economy was “a joint production with my wife.” </p><p>John Taylor died of cancer on 3rd May, 1849. Still concerned about gossip and scandal, Harriet insisted that they wait two years before they got married. A few months after the wedding the Westminster Review published The Enfranchisement of Women. Although the article had been mainly written by Taylor, it appeared under John Stuart Mill’s name. The same happened with the publication of an article in the Morning Chronicle (28th August, 1851) where they advocated new laws to protect women from violent husbands. A letter written by Mill in 1854 suggests that Harriet was reluctant to be described as joint author of Mill’s books and articles. “I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is to come, to have our two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours.”</p><p>John Stuart Mill had always favoured the secret ballot but Harriet disagreed and eventually changed her husband’s views on the subject. Taylor feared that people would vote in their own self-interest rather than for the good of the community. She believed that if people voted in public, the exposure of their selfishness would shame them in voting for the candidate who put forward policies that were in the interests of the majority. </p><p>Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill both suffered from tuberculosis. While in France seeking treatment for this condition in November, 1858, Harriet died. Mill and Taylor had been working on a book The Subjection of Women at the time. Helen, Harriet Taylor’s daughter, now helped Mill to finish the book. The two worked closely together for the next fifteen years. In his autobiography Mill wrote that “Whoever, either now or hereafter, may think of me and my work I have done, must never forget that it is the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three, the least considerable of whom, and above all the least original, is the one whose name is attached to it.”</p><p>As well as helping Mill with his books and articles, Helen Taylor was active in the women’s suffrage campaign. She was an original member of the Kensington Society that produced the first petition requesting votes for women. Helen also accompanied John Stuart Mill to the House of Commons on the day he attempted to add an amendment to the 1867 Reform Act that would have women the same political rights as men. However, the amendment was defeated by 196 votes to 73. Helen Taylor also took part in the agitation for women to be allowed to take part in local government and after the passing of the 1870 Education Act served as a member of the London School Board. </p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/" target="_top">Spartacus</a></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../t.htm">Index of the Letter T</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')

Later assisted Louis Bonaparte in 1848 to attain the throne, and became a deputy under his government of the Second Empire. Leading up to 1870, Thiers strongly agitated for a war with Prussia, but when France’s armies suffered defeat after defeat (this all within a period of a few weeks), Thiers quickly changed his policy, and "spoke out against the war" when France had already but lost. Through his maneuvering, he placed himself in a victorious political position after France’s crushing defeat in the war, despite his entire career of agitatation for war.

With the treaty signed, Thiers triumphantly entered the scene and called for national elections: Thiers was elected to 26 different departments; on Feb. 17, 1871 Thiers was elected the "chief executive power of the republic", and in August became the first president of the Third Republic.

Thomas had an uneventful midwestern childhood, helping to put himself through Marion High School as a paper carrier for Warren G. Harding’s Marion Daily Star. Like other paper carriers, he reported directly to Florence Kling Harding. “No pennies ever escaped her,” said Thomas. The summer after he graduated from high school his father accepted a pastorate at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, which allowed Norman to attend Bucknell University. He left Bucknell after one year to attend Princeton University, the beneficiary of the largesse of a wealthy uncle by marriage. Thomas graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1905.</p><p>After some settlement work and a trip around the world, Thomas decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary. He graduated from the seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1911. After assisting the Rev. Henry Van Dyke at the fashionable Brick Presbyterian Church on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, Thomas was appointed as pastor for the East Harlem Presbyterian Church, ministering to Italian-American Protestants. Union Theological Seminary had been, at that time, a center of the Social Gospel movement and liberal politics, and as a minister, Thomas preached against American participation in the First World War. This pacifist stance led to his being shunned by many of his fellow alumni from Princeton, and opposed by some of the leadership of the Presbyterian Church in New York. When church funding of the American Parish’s social programs was stopped, Thomas resigned his pastorate. Despite this resignation of his position, Thomas did not formally leave the ministry until 1931, after his mother’s death.</p><p>It was Thomas’ position as a conscientious objector which drew him to the Socialist Party of America (SPA), a staunchly antimilitarist organization. When SPA leader <a href="../h/i.htm#hillquit-morris">Morris Hillquit</a> made his campaign for Mayor of New York in 1917 on an anti-war platform, Thomas wrote to him expressing his good wishes. To his surprise, HIllquit wrote back, encouraging the young minister to work for his campaign, which Thomas energetically did. Soon thereafter he himself joined the Socialist Party. Despite his membership in the Marxist SPA, Thomas was never himself an orthodox Marxist, instead favoring a Christian socialist orientation.</p><p>Thomas was the secretary of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation even before the war, then an unpaid position. When the organization started a magazine called The World Tomorrow in January 1918, Thomas was employed as its paid editor. Together with his co-thinker Devere Allen, Thomas helped to make The World Tomorrow the leading voice of liberal Christian social activism of its day. In 1921, Thomas moved to secular journalism, when he was employed as associate editor of The Nation magazine.</p><p>In 1922 Thomas became co-director of the League for Industrial Democracy. Later, he was one of the founders of the National Civil Liberties Bureau (the precursor of the American Civil Liberties Union).</p><p><strong> Electoral politics</strong></p><p>Thomas ran for office four times in quick succession on the Socialist ticket—for Governor of New York in 1924, for Mayor of New York in 1925, for New York State Senate in 1926, and for New York City Alderman in 1927. None of these campaigns were particularly successful. Nevertheless, following <a href="../d/e.htm#evd">Eugene Debs’</a> death in 1926, there was a leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party’s two top political leaders—Victor L. Berger and Hillquit—were eligible to run for President of the United States by virtue of their foreign birth. The third main figure, Daniel Hoan was occupied as Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Down to approximately 8,000 dues paying members, the Socialist Party’s options were limited, and the little known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became the choice of the 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party as its standard bearer.</p><p>The 1928 campaign marked the first of campaigns of Thomas as the Presidential nominee of the Socilaist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas’ influence was considerably greater than that of the typical perennial candidate. Although socialism was viewed as an unsavory form of political thought by most middle-class Americans, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits—looked like and talked like a president and gained grudging admiration.</p><p>Thomas frequently spoke on the difference between socialism and Communism, explaining the differences between the movement he represented and that of revolutionary Marxism. His early admiration for the Russian Revolution subsequently turned into devout anti-Communism. (The revolutionaries thought him no better; <a href="../t/r.htm#trotsky-leon">Leon Trotsky</a>, on more than one occasion, levelled high-profile criticism at Thomas, accusing Thomas of  ‘...considering himself a socialist by the result of a misunderstanding.’) He wrote several books, among them his passionate defense of World War I conscientious objectors, Is Conscience a Crime?, and his statement of the 1960s social democratic consensus, Socialism Re-examined.</p><p><strong> Socialist Party politics</strong></p><p>Thomas failed to isolate himself from the rough and tumble internal factional politics of the Socialist Party, as his predecessor Debs had been able to do. At the 1932 Milwaukee Convention, Thomas and his radical pacifist allies in the party joined forces with constructive socialists from Wisconsin and a faction of young Marxist intellectuals called the “Militants” in backing a challenger to National Chairman Morris Hillquit. While Hillquit and his cohort retained control of the organization at this time, this action earned the lasting enmity of Hillquit’s New York-based allies of the so-called “Old Guard”. The diplomatic party peacemaker Hillquit died of tuberculosis the following year, lessening the stability of his faction.</p><p>At the 1934 Convention, Thomas’ connection with the Militants was deepened when he backed a radical Declaration of Principles authored by his long-time associate from the radical pacifist journal The World Tomorrow, Devere Allen. The Militants swept to majority control of the party’s governing National Executive Committee at this gathering, and the Old Guard retreated to their New York fortress and formalized their factional organization as the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, complete with a shadow Provisional Executive Committee and an office in New York City.</p><p>Although Thomas himself favored work to establish a broad Farmer-Labor Party upon the model of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, he nonetheless remained supportive of the Militants and their vision of an “all-inclusive party,” which welcomed members of dissident communist organizations (including Lovestoneites and Trotskyists) and worked together with the Communist Party USA in joint Popular Front activities. The party descended into a maelstrom of factionalism in the interval, with the New York Old Guard leaving to establish themselves as the Social Democratic Federation of America, taking with them control of party property, such as the Yiddish-language Jewish Daily Forward, the English-language New York Leader, the Rand School of Social Science, and the party’s summer camp in Pennsylvania. The party was left in dire financial circumstances. As the social democratic Marxists of the Old Guard were expelled and left the SP in 1936, revolutionary Marxists from the Workers Party of the United States were admitted en masse. Disagreements among the Militant faction led it to shatter into three rival groups, a Right Wing headed by Jack Altman, a Center group called “Clarity” headed by Herbert Zam and Gus Tyler, and a Trotskyist revolutionary Left Wing faction called the “Appeal” group after the name of their factional newspaper.</p><p>In 1937 Thomas returned from Europe determined to restore order in the Socialist Party. He and his followers in the party teamed up with the Clarity majority of the National Executive Committee and gave the green light to the New York Right Wing to expel the Appeal faction from the organization. These expulsions led to the departure of virtually the whole of the party’s youth section. Demoralization set in and the Socialist Party withered, its membership level below the lowest nadir of 1928.</p><p><strong> Causes</strong></p><p>Thomas was initially as outspoken in opposing the Second World War as he was with regard to the First World War. Upon returning from a European tour in 1937, he formed the Keep America Out of War Congress and spoke against war, thereby sharing a platform with the right wing isolationist America First Committee. However, after the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, his stance changed to support for US involvement , and later wrote self-critically for having “overemphasized both the sense in which it was a continuance of World War I and the capacity of nonfascist Europe to resist the Nazis.”.Norman Thomas, 1962</p><p>Thomas was one of the few public figures to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Thomas accused the ACLU of “dereliction of duty” when the organization supported the internment. Thomas also campaigned against racial segregation, environmental depletion, anti-labor laws and practices, and in favor of opening the United States to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution in the 1930s.</p><p>Thomas was an early proponent of birth control. The eugenicist Margaret Sanger recruited him to write “Some Objections to Birth Control Considered” in Religious and Ethical Aspects of Birth Control, edited and published by Sanger in 1926. Thomas accused the Roman Catholic Church of hypocritical opinions on sex, such as requiring priests to be celibate and maintaining that lay people should only have sex to reproduce. “This doctrine of unrestricted procreation is strangely inconsistent on the lips of men who practice celibacy and preach continence.”</p><p>Thomas also deplored the secular objection to birth control because it originated from “racial and national” group-think. “The white race, we are told, our own nation—whatever that nation may be—is endangered by practicing birth control. Birth control is something like disarmament—a good thing if effected by international agreement, but otherwise dangerous to us in both a military and economic sense. If we are not to be overwhelmed by the ’rising tide of color’ we must breed against the world. If our nation is to survive, it must have more cannon and more babies as prospective food for the cannon.”</p><p><strong> Later years</strong></p><p>After 1945 Thomas sought to make the non-Communist left the vanguard of social reform, in collaboration with labor leaders like Walter Reuther. He championed many seemingly unrelated progressive causes, while leaving unstated the essence of his political and economic philosophy.</p><p>In 1961, Thomas released an album The Minority Party in America: Featuring an Interview with Norman Thomas, on Folkways Records, which focused on the role of the third party.</p><p>Thomas’ 80th birthday in 1964 was marked by a well-publicized gala at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan. At the event Thomas called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and read birthday telegrams from Hubert Humphrey, Earl Warren, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He also received a check for $17,500 in donations from supporters. “It won’t last long,” he said of the check, “because every organization I’m connected with is going bankrupt.”</p><p>Thomas died on December 19, 1968.</p><p>The Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan and the Norman Thomas ’05 Library at Princeton University’s Forbes college are named after him.

The <em>New Reasoner</em> amalgamated with another ‘socialist humanist’ journal to form the <em>New Left Review</em>. However, Thompson increasing came into conflict with the editors of the <em>New Left Review</em> in opposition to rationalist and anti-humanist interpretations of Marxism, culminating in 1978 with his onslaught on ‘Stalinism in theory’ of <em>The Poverty of Theory</em> — calling on Marxist intellectuals return to the program of the (old) New Left outlined in the <em>Epistle to the Philistines</em> of 1957.</p><p>In the meantime, the main target of Thompson’s polemic had shifted, and the sixties were spent inveighing not so much against Stalinism, but the philistinism of ‘Natopolitanism’ and the apathy of the Labour Left and CP dissenters in leaving capitalism to ‘rot on the bough’ when Britain was over-ripe for socialism.

At the age of six Thorne began work for a rope and twine spinner. The death of his father in 1864 dramatically reduced the family income. Mrs. Thorne found employment sewing hooks and eyes on cards and William found work in the local brickyard. </p><p>Over the next few years Thorne did a variety of different jobs including a lath splitter, handyman and plumber’s mate. However, by the age of sixteen Thorne was back working in the brickyards. In 1875 Thorne’s mother remarried a local carpenter. Her new husband was an alcoholic and so Thorne decided to leave home and go on the “tramp.” </p><p>After a period as a navvy Thorne returned to Birmingham and found work at the Saltley Gas Works. In 1879 the twenty-two year old Thorne married Harriet Hallam, the daughter of one of Thorne’s fellow workers at Saltley. Both Will Thorne and his wife were illiterate and were unable to sign their names on the marriage certificate. </p><p>In 1882 Will and Harriet and their two children moved to London. Thorne found work at the Beckton Gasworks. Soon after arriving in the capital Thorne joined the Canning Town branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Thorne was appointed secretary of the branch and began attending national meetings of the organisation where he met H. M. Hyndman, George Bernard Shaw, Tom Mann, John Burns, Edward Aveling and Friedrich Engels. </p><p>One of the members of the SDF, Eleanor Marx, helped to teach Thorne how to read and write. Thorne’s confidence in his abilities gradually grew and by the late 1880s he was one of the SDF’s best known public speakers. At this time Thorne considered himself a communist and named one of his sons after Karl Marx.</p><p>In 1889 Thorne helped to establish the National Union of Gasworkers & General Labourers. He then defeated Ben Tillett in the election for the post of General Secretary of the union. Thorne led the successful negotiations for an eight hour day in the industry. As they previously did twelve hour shifts this was a great advert for union power and the Gasworkers’ Union soon had over 20,000 members. </p><p>Will Thorne’s success also inspired other unions to demand better pay and conditions. The most important of these was the London Dock Strike led by Ben Tillett in 1889. The dockers demanded four hours continuous work at a time and a minimum rate of sixpence an hour. The employers hoped to starve the dockers back to work but Thorne and other trade union activists such as John Burns, Eleanor Marx, James Keir Hardie and H. H. Champion, gave valuable support to the 10,000 men out on strike. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Labour Church raised money for the strikers and their families. Trade Unions in Australia sent over £30,000 to help the dockers to continue the struggle. After five weeks the employers accepted defeat and granted all the dockers’ main demands. </p><p>Thorne was now seen as a dangerous man and attempts were made to weaken the Gasworkers’ Union. South Metropolitan Gas Company introduced a profit sharing scheme for the workforce and during the strike in 1890 the Leeds Gas Company sacked union members. When the Gasworkers’ Union forced the company to reinstate the workers, Friedrich Engels was so impressed with Thorne’s leadership he gave him an autographed copy of <em>Das Kapital</em>. </p><p>In 1894 Thorne was elected to the Trades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee (a position he held until 1933).

He became the leader of the union and in 1911 it won a national strike. However, the following year, Tillet\' union suffered a defeat at the hands of the Port of London Authority. It was during this strike that Tillet joined with George Lansbury and Will Dyson to form the trade union newspaper, the <em>Daily Herald</em>. </p><p>Unlike many socialist, Ben Tillett fully supported Britai\' involvement in the First World War. His enthusiasm for aerial bombardment of German civilian centres and his views that pacifists should be severely punished, made him unpopular with many people in the labour movement.

Broz worked as a mechanic in small workshops. During World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army. He was captured as a prisoner of war and transported to the Russian interior. He joined a Bolshevik group while in prison and after escaping, he joined the Bolshevik Red Guards several months before the October Revolution.</p><p>He was registered as a member of the Communist party. Back in Yugoslavia, he continued his revolutionary work as a secretary of a metal union. He was picked up and spent six years in prison. He was released in 1934 and joined the Comintern in Moscow. Visited Moscow several times and was appointed Secretary of Yugoslav Communist Party in 1937. His success was due in part to the internal rivalry of communist leaders. In January 1939, he was officially appointed general secretary of the Yugoslav Communist Party. </p><p>After Nazi invasion, set up his Partisans in Southern Serbia in 1941, and led by far the most powerful resistance movement in Europe. By end of the War, Tito’s forces had control of the whole country. Refused to take Stalin’s direction, and was expelled from the Cominform in 1948. Remained leader of the country till his death in 1980. </p><p>From then on, Tito had a major voice in all the ensuing phases of the Yugoslav revolution. During World War II, he became commander in chief of the partisan armed forces. In 1943, the Second Session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia established the second Yugoslavia as a federal socialist republic of  six republics. Tito had to make use of all his charisma to convince his comrade-partisans that all peoples of Yugoslavia should be granted equal rights. The partisan struggle ended with a complete victory of the communists. Supported strategically by their allies, both of the West and the East, complying formally with some demands for  a multi-party system, Tito could form his first government on March 7, 1945. The politicians of the former Kingdom and some well intentioned participants of the liberation war were completely neutralized and soon eliminated by the power policy of the Communist Party. </p><p>More dangerous for Tito’s political career was the clash with the USSR. The Cominform conflict led to a break with Moscow. Tito’s internal power base was threatened as well, and large-scale purges in the party were bitterly needed. Needed also was an alternative ideology. In the beginning of the 1950s self-management was rediscovered in Marx’s writings and step by step introduced in Yugoslavia. But this timid democratization of the regime again threatened the party organization, now from within. In 1952, Tito was forced to put aside his close aid and once vice-president of Yugoslavia, Milovan Đilas. Another possible heir, Aleksander Rankovic, dominated the Ministry of the Interior and the secret police for years. He ultimately controlled Tito himself and tapped his telephone. In 1966, Tito was obliged to discard his conservative comrade, the second in rank. </p><p>After the fall of hardliner Ranković, economic and political liberalization broke through and this threatened the party monopoly anew. The Croatian Spring and similar opposition movements in other republics rose to an unexpected intensity. They were ultimately repressed by Tito in the 1970s after the Karađorđevo crisis meeting. At the same time, on advice of the Slovene Edvard Kardelj, he pushed through constitutional reforms to take the wind out of the sails of nationalism. By granting more autonomy, responsibility and formal self-government to the republics, he hoped to reduce the tensions between the federal units. In the same spirit, he set up a federal presidency structure to ensure the continuity of the system after his death.</p><p>In international affairs, Tito profited much from the rivalries of the two blocs during the Cold War. He played a leading role in the movement of the so-called Non-Aligned Countries. </p><p>Tito died in May 1980 and the structures set up to ensure continuity functioned more or less satisfactorily for a few years. Then, divergent aspirations could no longer be reconciled and the federal structure exploded. External Western interest had been eroded away by the fall of the communist system in the USSR. </p><p>There exist a lot of myths about Tito, beginning with his date of birth, following the different names he carried and ending with the suggestion that part of his official life was not his, but figured by a (German or Austrian) double. Probably, all these histories were not very significant for the course of the Yugoslav history. Anyhow, new stories will present themselves and all of Tito’s biographies should be read with care and suspicion.</p><p>One good of the many bibliographies of Tito is: Phyllis, Auty. <em>Political leaders of the Twentieth century</em>.

Tresca moved to the United States in 1904, to escape a prison term for his radical political activities in Italy. He settled in Philadelphia, where he became the editor of Il Proletario, the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation (ISF). Tresca helped shift the political orientation of the ISF to Syndicalism.</p><p><strong>Tresca and anarchism</strong></p><p>Tresca’s political views became increasingly more radical and he soon came to identify himself as an anarchist. Tresca resigned as editor of Il Proletario and began publishing his own newspaper, La Plebe. He would later transfer La Plebe to Pittsburgh and, with it, revolutionary ideas to Italian miners and mill workers in Western Pennsylvania.</p><p>Tresca joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1912, when he was invited by the union to Lawrence, Massachusetts to help mobilize the Italian workers during a campaign to free strike leaders Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, who were in prison on false murder charges. After the victorious strike in Lawrence, Tresca was active in several strikes across the United States; the Little Falls, New York textile workers’ strike (1912), the New York City hotel workers’ strike (1913), the Paterson silk strike (1913), and the Mesabi Range, Minnesota, miners’ strike (1916).</p><p><strong>Opposition to fascism, Stalinism, and the Mafia</strong> </p><p>Tresca became a major figure among Italian-Americans in trying to halt Benito Mussolini’s attempts to organize Italian immigrants into Fascist support groups. At this time, Tresca was editing an anti-Fascist newspaper named Il Martello, where he blasted Mussolini as a class enemy and traitor (the latter accusation made reference to the socialist roots of Fascism). Tresca’s activities were being monitored in Rome, while, in the United States, he was under heavy surveillance from the American government. In 1926, Fascists attempted to assassinate Tresca with a bomb during a rally. He was part of the defense committee for accused murderers Sacco and Vanzetti, and frequently spoke in their defense at rallies and in articles.</p><p>During the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet Communists and Stalinism, particularly after the Soviet Union had engineered the destruction of the anarchist movement in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution.[1] Prior to this, Tresca had supported the Bolsheviks, reasoning that a Communist state was preferable to a capitalist state, regarding Soviet Communists as allies in the fight against Fascism.</p><p>Tresca was a member of the Dewey Commission which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. </p><p>In early 1938 Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Juliet Poyntz to prevent her defection from the Communist Party USA underground apparatus. Tresca alleged that, before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about her disgust over Joseph Stalin’s Great Terror. In 1941 Tresca, in a revealing moment, admitted to Max Eastman that Nicola Sacco was guilty of the crime with which he was charged, though Vanzetti was innocent.</p><p>In New York, Tresca also began a public campaign of criticism of the Mafia in his weekly newspaper, Il Martello.

During World War II he worked with the British Government Code and Cypher School, where he developed brilliant techniques to break the enem\' codes. In 1945 he joined the National Physical Laboratory in London to build a large electronic digital computer. In 1948 he became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at the University of Manchester, building the computer with the largest memory capacity in the world at that time. His pioneering work on the theory of computer languages was of epoch-making significance.</p><p>It was his early work at Princeton however, which has had the most profound affect on the development of philosophy. In 1935, he took on the task of finding an algorithm (i.e. a finite sequence of well-defined steps of reasoning) to find undecidable propositions in a mathematical theory which <a href="../g/o.htm#godel-kurt">Gödel</a> had proved, in his 1931 theorem, must exist in every theory; the aim being to eliminate them and restore the theory to completeness and consistency, effectively negating Göde\' theorem.</p><p>The surprising result was “<span class="book">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Halting Problem</span>” in which Turing described a hypothetical (“Turing”) machine with (1) a finite set of instructions (program), (2) some means of executing the instructions step-by-step (processor), and (3) some readable means for recording each step (memory). This elementary Turing machine was able to execute <em>any</em> algorithm and became the theoretical model for the digital computers that would come into being in the 1940s. The problem Turing had set out to solve was now transformed into the problem of whether or not there was a program, which once initiated, would keep the computer working without ever stopping or getting into a repetitive cycle. The fact that this approach failed to negate Göde\' theorem, verified it in fact, paled next to the significance of the “Turing machine”, but finally put to rest the hopes of <a href="../../people/h/i.htm#hilbert-david">David Hilbert</a> and his school that all mathematical propositions could be expressed as a set of axioms and derived theorems.</p><p>Turing is also renowned as the first champion of Artificial Intelligence, claiming that computers would eventually be constructed that would be capable of human thought, and he proposed a simple test, now known as the Turing test, to assess this capability.

After a brief stint in theAustrian army in 1759-60, Verri returned to Milan, where he quickly fell inamong the Italian Enlightenment figures of the day, notably Cesare Beccaria.</p><p>With Beccaria and his own brother, Alessandro Verri, he founded the "Societàdei Pugni" in 1761, a discussion group concentrating on public policy andeconomics. From 1764 to 1766, the group published the Enlightenmentjournal, <i>Il Caffè</i>.</p><p>Verri began publishing tracts on economic questions in 1760.   In1763, he produced his <i>Meditazioni sulla felicità</i>, a treatise onhedonistic ethics along the lines of Helvétius (spiced with Rousseau), thus making him one of thefathers of utilitarianism.

Verri argued that price depends on the "apparent abundance" of a good and the"need" for it. He defines "need" as a species ofpain which humans seek to minimize activity and industry. For Verri, "needs"are not mere desires but must be expressed with payment, thus they can beconsidered "demands" in the modern sense. Following Beccaria,Verri noted that abundance increases with number of offers (i.e. sellers) and "needs" with the number of sellers. He notes thatthe value of a commodity varies directly with need and inversely toabundance. In this manner, Verri can be regarded as an important predecessor of the Marginalist Revolution.</p><p>Verr\' quantitative work includes not only admirable attempt atcalculating the balance of payments, but also the first mathematical expression of ademand curve. On economic policy, Verri followed the radical <i>laissez-faire</i>positions advocated by the Physiocrats.

Wagenknecht and the Left Wing attempted to establish themselves as a parallel National Executive Committee despite the outgoing NEC’s refusal to officially tabulate the vote, and the “new NEC” met one time in Chicago in August in an attempt to assert authority over the party apparatus, with Wagenknecht declaring himself “Executive Secretary Pro Tem.” This effort was rebuffed by sitting Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the party’s Regular faction, however.</p><p><strong>The Communist Years (1919-1956)</strong></p><p>Wagenknecht was not eligible to participate in the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA owing to the expulsion of the Socialist Party of Ohio from the party for their endorsement of the Left Wing Manifesto, which was portrayed by the Regular-dominated outgoing NEC as an automatic violation of the party constitution. Consequently, Wagenknecht cleverly rented a room downstairs from the SPA’s convention at Machinists’ Hall in Chicago and ran a parallel convention to the official one upstairs — a gathering which was joined by a steady stream of disgruntled Left Wing delegates bolting from the official gathering. Wagenknecht presided over this alternative convention, which on Aug. 31, 1919, declared itself to be the founding convention of the  <a href="../../orgs/c/o.htm#clp">Communist Labor Party of America</a>. This convention elected Wagenknecht as National Secretary of the CLP, a role which he maintained throughout the organization’s brief history.</p><p>The CLP was devastated by the raids of the US Department of Justice headed by A. Mitchell Palmer and his Special Assistant, J. Edgar Hoover, coordinated actions which began in the fall of 1919 and reached their zenith with a mass operation conducted during the evening of Jan. 1/2, 1919. The CLP was driven underground, local organizations broken up into secret “groups” of no more than 10 members who met furtively, using pseudonyms and attempting to avoid detection by the authorities. Wagenknecht was known variously as “Paul Holt,” “A.B. Mayer,” “A.B. Martin,” and “U.P. Duffy” during the “underground years” of 1920-1923.</p><p>In April of 1920, Wagenknecht’s former prisonmate, turned Executive Secretary rival, C.E. Ruthenberg left the Communist Party of America (CPA) along with a number of co-thinkers and a big portion of the organization’s cash. This Ruthenberg-CPA and Wagenknecht’s CLP finally determined to achieve the organizational unity demanded by the Communist International at a secret convention held at Bridgman, Michigan at the end of May 1920. This gathering determined to retain Wagenknecht as Executive Secretary of the new organization, called the United Communist Party (UCP), assigning the important role of Editor of the party’s official newspaper, The Communist, to Ruthenberg. Wagenknecht also served on the UCP’s Editorial Committee and on the 3 member Unity Committee which continued to negotiate a merger agreement with the remaining CPA organization, headed by Charles Dirba. Unity with this group was finally forged at a May 1921 secret convention held at the Overlook Mountain House hotel near Woodstock, New York. Confusingly, this new unified organization retained the name “Communist Party of America,” the same moniker shared by the Dirba majority and the Ruthenberg minority organizations.</p><p>The merger of the UCP meant the end of Wagenknecht’s tenure as an Executive Secretary. From June 1921, Wagenknecht served as the Manger of the unified CPA’s “legal” weekly newspaper, <em>The Toiler</em>, with Wagenknecht’s brother-in-law, Elmer Allison editing the publication. In 1922, a legal “mass organization” called the Friends of Soviet Russia was established by the unified CPA, and Wagenknecht was named by the CEC of the party to head it. He also sat on the Central Executive Committees of the (underground) unified CPA and the party’s “Legal Political Party” — the Workers Party of America (WPA) — from 1922 to 1923, when the underground party was finally dissolved. Thereafter, Wagenknecht was made the District Organizer for the tiny Wilkes Barre district of the WPA, with this job beginning in May of 1923.</p><p>In 1924, Wagenknecht worked as a “Director of Special Campaigns” for the WPA, managing the fund-raising drive for <em>The Daily Worker</em>. Wagenknecht seems to have been difficult for both the Pepper-Ruthenberg-Lovestone and the Foster-Cannon-Lore factions and was shipped off to the Philippines to organize trade unions on behalf of the <a href="../../orgs/r/e.htm#red-international-labor-unions">Red International of Labor Unions</a> (RILU) late in 1924.</p><p>Later, Wagenknecht turned his hand to drama, producing and co-starring in The Passaic Textile Strike, a semi-fictional account of the 13-month strike of 16,000 textile workers, initially led by Wagenknecht and other American Marxist and Communist leaders.</p><p>Wagenknecht separated from his wife Hortense in 1930 and was finally divorced in January of 1948.</p><p>In 1933, Wagenknecht served as the Executive Secretary of the National Committee to Aid Victims of German Fascism, a CP-sponsored “mass organization.” He was the State Chairman of the Communist Party in Missouri from 1938 to 1941 and in Illinois from 1941 to 1945. Wagenknecht remained a Communist Party loyalist for the rest of his days, dying on Aug. 26, 1956 in Illinois) and honored at his passing with a full-page photograph in Political Affairs, the theoretical monthly of the Communist Party USA.</p> <p class="inline">Written by Tim Davenport</p>')

During a break in his studies to do military service, Weber became very close to the historian Hermann Baumgarten and his wife Ida, friends of his aunt, who stimulated Weber’s interest in the study of history.

The founding convention elected Wicks to the Central Executive Committee of the CPA, which in turn elected him to its governing inner circle, the Executive Council.[1] Wicks was the only member of the Michigan tendency to accept office in the new CPA. He also served as Associate Editor of the party’s official organ, The Communist. Wicks was jailed in Nov. 1919 in connection with these activities as part of the Justice Department’s crackdown on members of the Communist Party.</p><p>In 1920, Wicks rejoined his Michigan comrades when he became a member of the Proletarian Party of America, serving on the governing National Executive Committee of that organization. Wicks was the fraternal delegate of the PPA to the founding convention of the Workers Party of America in Dec. 1921, but he came as a foe rather than a friend, engaging in a bitter criticism of that organization. After the Proletarian Party’s decision to support the legal arm of the Central Caucus faction’s “Communist Party of America” in 1922, Wicks was named as the editor of the organ of this "United Toilers of America," <em>The Workers’ Challenge</em>. </p><p>Wicks joined the Workers Party following the liquidation of the Central Caucus split in the fall of 1922 and served on the CEC of WPA from 1922 to 1923. He also served on the editorial board of The Worker during that same period. In 1923 Wicks was named National Organizer of the WPA and conducted a 5 week East Coast speaking tour in Sept.-Oct. 1923.</p><p>Wicks was first accused of being a spy in 1923, charged with having denounced Communist Labor Party founding member Victor Saulit to immigration authorities while both were members of the Socialist Party of Oregon. A WPA inquest commission cleared Wicks of this charge, however.</p><p>Wicks was a delegate to the 3rd Convention of the WPA in 1923 and was a consistent backer of the Pepper-Ruthenberg faction. In 1928 Wicks was a delegate to the 6th World Congress of the Comintern. He remained in Moscow for a year as North American representative to the Profintern. Thereafter, Wicks was sent to Australia and various Asian countries as a Comintern Representative.</p><p>Wicks returned to the United States in the middle 1930s, standing as the CPUSA candidate for US Senate from Pennsylvania in 1934.

Along with the Anti-Nazi League RAR played an important role in ensuring that the National Front (a fascist organisation) was beaten back. In particular it intervened in the emerging punk scene, where many leading lights initially used swastikas as a provocation against good taste, and ensured that it became dominated by anti-racist and anti-fascist ideas.

Wittgenstein proposed to solve this problem by viewing propositions as “pictures of situations in the world” made up of <em>signs</em> that had to be correlated with simple elements of reality in order to understand the connection between the words and the reality they referred to. Wittgenstein then aimed to make a logical analysis on the basis of the logical form of these signs and the corresponding logical forms of the elements of reality that they signified. The key to this analysis had to be the uncovering of the particular logical form common to both reality and language, which made the correlation possible. Wittgenstein held that, on the bais of logical considerations, this common logical form cannot itself be represented.</p><p>Feeling that the <span class="book">Tractatus</span> had exhausted his contributions to philosophy, Wittgenstein became a school teacher, working in various villages in Austria, only occasionally meeting with other philosophers, particularly those of the <a href="../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle">Vienna Circle</a>; he became very depressed and frequently thought of suicide. </p><p>In 1929, Wittgenstein returned to lecture at Cambridge, where the notes taken by his students, gradually came to build a considerable reputation for him. Until his death in 1951, Wittgenstein continued to feel himself an outsider, and always regarded his own work as unsatisfactory and incomplete, but he now wrote prodigiously, and his <em>magnum opus</em>, the <span class="book">Philosophical Investigations</span>, published only after his death, is highly regarded to this day. </p><p>In this later period of his work, Wittgenstein came to reject his former conception, holding rather that there is <em>no</em> unity hidden in the diversity of language, and his lectures ruthlessly break down and destroy every attempt to generalise or say something definite or provable or rule-governed about language; the most that could be said about a number of things that in some way were deemed to fall into the same category was that there was a “family resemblance”, and the only meaning in the connection between words and concepts is their connection to human life.</p><p class="fst"><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href="../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/at/wittgens.htm" target="_top"><span class="book">Lectures in Philosophy</span></a>.

The family moved a great deal during Mary’s childhood and she lived for periods at Epping, Barking, Beverley, Hoxton, Walworth and Laugharne in Wales.</p><p>In 1784, Mary Wollstonecraft opened a school in Newington Green, a small village close to Hackney, with her sister Eliza and a friend, Fanny Blood. Soon after arriving in Newington Green, Mary made friends with Richard Price, a minister at the local Dissenting Chapel. Price and his friend, Joseph Priestly, were the leaders of a group of men known as Rational Dissenters. Price had written several books including the very influential <em>Review of the Principal Questions of Morals</em> (1758) where he argued that individual conscience and reason should be used when making moral choices. Price also rejected the traditional Christian ideas of original sin and eternal punishment. As a result of these religious views, some Anglicans accused Rational Dissenters of being atheists. </p><p>Although Mary was brought up as an Anglican, she soon began attending Richard Price’s chapel. Price held radical political views and had encountered a great deal of hostility when he supported the cause of American independence. At Price’s home Mary Wollstonecraft met other leading radicals including the publisher, Joseph Johnson. He was impressed by Mary’s ideas on education and commissioned her to write a book on the subject. In <em>Thoughts on the Education of Girls</em>, published in 1786, Mary attacked traditional teaching methods and suggested new topics that should be studied by girls. Two years later Wollstonecraft helped Johnson to found the journal <em>Analytical Review</em>. </p><p>In November, 1789, Richard Price preached a sermon praising the French Revolution. Price argued that British people, like the French, had the right to remove a bad king from the throne. Edmund Burke, was appalled by this sermon and wrote a reply called Reflections on the Revolution in France where he argued in favour of the inherited rights of the monarchy. Wollstonecraft was upset by Burke’s attack on her friend and she decided to defend him by writing a pamphlet A Vindication of the Rights of Man. In her pamphlet Wollstonecraft not only supported Price but also pointed out what she thought was wrong with society. This included the slave trade, the game laws and way that the poor were treated.</p><p>The publication of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Man</em> brought Wollstonecraft to the attention of other radical thinkers such as Tom Paine, John Cartwright, John Horne Tooke, William Godwin and William Blake. Wollstonecraft met several of these men including Godwin who was busily writing a book on Political Justice. In 1791 the first part of Tom Paine’s Rights of Man was published. This book created a burst of radical activity and although Paine was forced to flee the country, others were determined to carry on the struggle in England. Soon after Rights of Man appeared, two of Britain’s leading Rational Dissenters, Richard Price and Joseph Priestly, formed the Unitarian Society, an organisation that was to have a profound influence on religious and political ideas in Britain.</p><p>The following year Mary Wollstonecraft published her most important book, <em><a href="../../../reference/archive/wollstonecraft-mary/1792/vindication-rights-woman/index.htm" target="_top">Vindication of the Rights of Women</a></em>. In the book Wollstonecraft attacked the educational restrictions that kept women in a state of “ignorance and slavish dependence.” She was especially critical of a society that encouraged women to be “docile and attentive to their looks to the exclusion of all else.” Wollstonecraft described marriage as “legal prostitution” and added that women “may be convenient slaves, but slavery will have its constant effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.”</p><p>The ideas in Wollstonecraft’s book were truly revolutionary and caused tremendous controversy. One critic described Wollstonecraft as a “hyena in petticoats.” Mary Wollstonecraft argued that to obtain social equality society must rid itself of the monarchy as well as the church and military hierarchies. Mary Wollstonecraft’s views even shocked fellow radicals. Whereas advocates of parliamentary reform such as Jeremy Bentham and John Cartwright had rejected the idea of female suffrage, Wollstonecraft argued that the rights of man and the rights of women were one and the same thing. </p><p>In 1793 Edmund Burke led the attack on the radicals in Britain. He described the London Corresponding Society and the Unitarian Society as “loathsome insects that might, if they were allowed, grow into giant spiders as large as oxen.” King George III issued a proclamation against seditious writings and meetings, threatening serious punishments for those who refused to accept his authority. </p><p>In June, 1793 Mary decided to move to France with the American writer, Gilbert Imlay. The following year, Mary gave birth to Fanny. After her relationship with Imlay came to an end she returned to London. Mary married William Godwin in March, 1797 and soon afterwards, a second daughter, Mary, was born. The baby was healthy but the placenta was retained in the womb. The doctor’s attempt to remove the placenta resulted in blood poisoning and Mary died on 10th September, 1797. </p><p>See <a href="../../../reference/archive/wollstonecraft-mary/index.htm" target="_top">Mary Wollstonecraft Archive</a>.</p><p class="inline">From <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/">Spartacus</a></p> <p> </p>')

There he wrote “Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception” (1858-62).</p><p>It was during this period that Wundt offered the first course ever taught in scientific psychology. Until then, psychology had been regarded as a branch of philosophy to be conducted primarily by rational analysis. Wundt instead stressed the use of experimental methods drawn from the natural sciences. His lectures on psychology were published as “Lectures on the Mind of Humans and Animals” (1863). </p><p>Bypassed in 1871 for the appointment to succeed Helmholtz, Wundt then applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology, “Principles of Physiological Psychology” (1874). The “Principles” advanced a system of psychology that sought to investigate the immediate experiences of consciousness, including sensations, feelings, volitions, apperception and ideas using <em>introspection</em>. </p><p>Wundt recognized the two different objective processes involved in Psychology: culture and physiology. The physiological basis of psychology could be studied by methods of introspection. <em>Völkerpsychologie</em>, however, could not be studied by laboratory methods because the higher psychological functions extend beyond individual human consciousness, for example, in the construction of languages and social institutions. <em>Völkerpsychologie</em> requires the use of a developmental-historical methodology, and must therefore incorporate ethnology, the “science of the origins of peoples.”</p><p class="indentb">“Its problem relates to those mental products which are created by a community of human life and are, therefore, inexplicable in terms merely of individual consciousness, since they presuppose the reciprocal action of many ...

The son of a Jewish petty bourgeois family, he had no formal education but was taught at home, and started work as a teacher at the age of 15. He soon took an active part in the strike struggles which broke out in 1900-1901, and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1901.</p><p>During 1902 he went abroad to Berlin and Paris, then studied for a time in the University of Heme: while in Switierland he met Lenin and Plekhanov early in 1903. During August of that year he attended the historic second Social Democratic Labour Party Congress in London, when the split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks took place. Zinoviev immediately supported the Bolsheviks and joined their faction; after the congress he was sent back to Russia as a party worker, but his health was poor and he had to return abroad.</p><p>In 1905 he went again to Russia and took a leading part in the St. Petersburg party organization, publishing the newspaper <em>Proletary</em>. Throughout 1906 he carried out agitation among the St. Petersburg metal workers, who sent him as their delegate to the Fifth Party Congress of May 1907 in London, where he was elected for the first time to the Central Committee. The next year he was arrested for his revolutionary activities, but was released on the grounds of his ill-health; he then went to Switzerland and became Lenin’s closest collaborator from that time until 1917. He was the only Bolshevik to support Lenin in 1910 against those who advocated compromising with the Mensheviks and retaining the joint central committee (during this period the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were formally in the same organization). In 1911 he lectured at Lenin’s party school for Bolshevik underground workers, held at Longjumeau, near Paris.</p><p>At the Sixth Party Conference in Prague during January 1912 he was elected to the new all-Bolshevik Central Committee.</p><p>During the First World War he took a clear internationalist stand, representing the Bolshevik party at the 1915 Zimmerwald conference against the war, and the Kienthal conference of 1916; he helped to organize the ‘Zimmerwald Left’ which called for the imperialist war to be turned into a civil war. Together with Lenin he wrote the pamphlet <em>Socialism and the War</em> (1915) and a collection of articles, <em>Against the Current</em> (1916) which attacked the social-patriotic betrayal of the reformist parties in the Second International.</p><p>After the February revolution of 1917 he returned to Russia with Lenin, but, like the other leading Bolsheviks, initially opposed Lenin’s ‘April Theses’ which called for the overthrow of the bourgeois Provisional Government. He went underground with Lenin during the ‘July Days’, when the Provisional Government clamped down on the Bolsheviks; they were both forced to hide in Finland, and returned to Petrograd only in October.</p><p>At this point, faced with the immediate necessity of taking power, Zinoviev, along with Kamenev, came out openly against the insurrection. He and Kamenev published an article in the non-party press which exposed the Bolshevik’s plans for the insurrection; for this Lenin denounced them as ‘strike breakers’ and proposed their expulsion from the party, a demand which was later dropped.</p><p>After the October revolution, Zinoviev advocated a coalition government to include the Mensheviks and SRs and resigned from the Central Committee in protest against Lenin’s resolution excluding these parties, but returned within a few days.</p><p>Nevertheless he became one of the Soviet regime’s principal figures; at first the chief party spokesman in the Trade Union Central Council, he presided at all the early trade union congresses, and was later elected president of the Petrograd Soviet. Petrograd was the centre of the metal-working industries where the core of Bolshevik trade union cadres were concentrated, and where Zinoviev had considerable support within the party.</p><p>When the government was transferred to Moscow during the Civil War, he was appointed chairman of the Northern Commune: at this time he was also a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the 7th Army and president of the Committee for the Defence of the Republic. At the Eighth Party Congress in March 1919 he was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and a full member at the Tenth Congress in1921.</p><p>At the Comintern’s foundation in 1919, on Lenin’s motion he was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. One of his biggest achievements was to win the majority of the German Independent Social-Democratic Party for fusion with the new German Communist Party (KPD) in 1920, after a four-hour speech in German! However, against Trotsky’s opposition to an adventure, he and Bela Kun instigated the abortive rising in Germany in 1921, believing that this would ‘electrify’ and spur to action the masses; in fact its defeat led to a great crisis in the German Communist Party and increased the isolation of the USSR.</p><p>At the plenum of the ECCI prior to the Third Congress of the Comintern, he bitterly opposed the introduction of the tactic of the ‘United Front’, the policy designed to win the mass of workers away from their reformist leaders. However he eventually agreed that this tactic should be presented to the Congress as the official policy of the Executive, and delivered the main report to the Congress himself.</p><p>A decisive turning point in the international situation was the defeat of the 1923 German revolution. As president of the Comintern, Zinoviev urged on the KPD with left phrases, but only half-heartedly supported Trotsky’s proposal for a definite plan of action. When the irresoluteness of the KPD leadership led to the failure of the plan, he sanctioned the cancelling of the insurrection at the decisive moment and made the KPD secretary, Brandler, the scapegoat for its failure. When Trotsky protested against this bureaucratic evasion of responsibility, Zinoviev used his influence within the foreign Communist Parties to have Trotsky denounced at the fifth Comintern Congress (the so-called ‘Congress of Bolshevization’)</p><p>Zinoviev had opposed Trotsky at almost every crucial turn of Bolshevik policy in government; after the onset of Lenin’s illness in 1922 he had come together with Kamenev and Stalin to form the <em>troika</em> which was eventually to wield virtually all state power. Despite Lenin’s serious doubts, he led the Petrograd delegation in pushing through Stalin’s appointment to General Secretary at the 11th Party Congress in 1922.</p><p>At the 12th Party Congress which took place in the vacuum of leadership left by Lenin’s illness, the <em>troika</em> covered up their intrigue with a whispering campaign against Trotsky (‘he imagines himself a Bonaparte’) and a glorification of Lenin.</p><p>Zinoviev in fact took the initiative in the struggle against Trotsky, answering the crisis of leadership with the suppression of all discussion of policy: ‘Every criticism of the party line, even a so-called ‘left’ criticism, is now objectively a Menshevik criticism.’</p><p>However, when in the summer of 1923 wildcat strikes broke out in the industrial centres, threatening the base of the regime, the triumvirs found many party cadres in sympathy with the strikers’ demands. Within the party, 46 prominent Bolsheviks signed a declaration in October calling for the restoration of party democracy and the right to form factions, and severely criticizing the economic policies of the ruling clique. This was close to the policies fought for by Trotsky.</p><p>Adapting to this opposition, Zinoviev made a speech in November promising to restore party democracy—but once begun, the discussion revealed enormous hostility to the trium-virate within the party, and it was hastily suppressed.</p><p>Trotsky then openly broke with the ‘Old Guard’, writing an Open Letter attacking their handling of the ‘New Course’.</p><p>Zinoviev’s reply, at the 13th Congress the next year, was to demand that Trotsky should publicly recant his views—an unheard-of demand at that time which many of Zinoviev’s own supporters would not back, and which he had to drop. ‘It is now a thousand times more necessary than ever that the party should be monolithic’, he declaimed.</p><p>In autumn 1924 Trotsky wrote ‘The Lessons of October’ as a preface to an edition of his speeches in 1917. Zinoviev used this as an excuse to launch the ‘Literary debate’—a massive campaign in the party press in which the slogan of Trotsky’s ‘under-estimation of the peasantry’ was invented and proclaimed, while the writings of Trotsky and his comrades in the Left Opposition were suppressed. It was implied that Trotsky’s non-Bolshevik past meant he was hostile to Bolshevism — i.e. that he was basically a Menshevik at heart.</p><p>At the end of 1924 Zinoviev demanded in the Politburo that the Central Committee be asked to expel Trotsky from its ranks; Stalin, sensing the crisis this would provoke within the party, refused to comply. Instead Trotsky was dismissed as Commissar of War. Once Trotsky had been removed from any position of power, the chief force holding the triumvirate together was gone. Zinoviev intrigued with Kamenev to oust Stalin from the General Secretaryship, and proposed that he replace Trotsky as Commissar of War; they found it was too late to dislodge Stalin from his position in the apparatus.</p><p>The increasing isolation of Russia following the defeat of the German revolution in 1923 and the temporary stabilization of conditions in Western Europe had strengthened the position of the bureaucracy, and during late 1924 brought Stalin to the fore as the dominant force in the <em>troika.</em> When Bukharin abandoned the perspective of revolution in Europe and in autumn 1924 advocated making wholesale concessions to the peasantry so as gradually to build ‘socialism in one country’, Stalin seized on this theory as an ideological justification for the growing power of the apparatus and in April 1925 attempted to make it official party policy.</p><p>Both Zinoviev and Kamenev strongly opposed this move, but the breach was hushed up in order to avoid scandalizing the party. Zinoviev did not come out openly against ‘socialism in one country’ until September 1925, in his book <em>Leninism,</em> where he argued that on its own the backward Soviet economy could never raise its productive technique to a level high enough for socialism, and that to abandon the perspective of revolution abroad was a break with Leninist internationalism. At the October session of the Central Committee he demanded a free debate on this question at the forthcoming 14th Party Congress, but was outvoted by the supporters of Stalin and Bukharin, who at the same time prohibited any public criticism of official policy.</p><p>A tremendous clash between the opposing factions took place at the 14th congress, but the outcome was that Stalin and Bukharin increased their majority on the CC. The new CC immediately set about destroying the strength of the ‘Leningrad opposition’: Zinoviev was replaced by Kirov as Leningrad party secretary and his supporters were removed from positions of authority.</p><p class="skip"> </p><p>In April 1926 the Leningrad and Left Oppositions finally began to collaborate; Zinoviev then revealed to Trotsky the methods by which the triumvirate had excluded him from power. At the July session of the CC Zinoviev declared that ‘On the question of apparatus-bureaucratic repression, Trotsky was right as against us’; and Trotsky read out a joint statement attacking Stalin’s policies.</p><p>Stalin hit back with a charge that they had violated party discipline by forming a faction, and the CC voted by a massive majority to dismiss Zinoviev as president of the Comintern. The Opposition turned to the party rank-and-file, only to find an organized heckling campaign to prevent them being heard at meetings: Zinoviev was driven from the platform at the 15th conference of the party. However, he shrank back from an all-out conflict with the apparatus, vowing not to bring matters to the point of expulsion from the party—which meant accepting in advance the limits laid down by Stalin.</p><p>Ideologically, Zinoviev remained hostile to the theory of permanent revolution and clung to the shibboleth of the ‘democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry’, even within the Joint Opposition, and insisted that their <em>Platform</em> (1927) should specifically deny its validity.</p><p>The Platform was drawn up in May as a balance-sheet of the position reached by the revolution, and a campaign for signa-tures to it was launched in preparation for the 15th Congress due at the end of the year. Zinoviev optimistically expected 20-30,000 signatures; they got 6,000. Although their perspectives had been proved correct, the effect of the international defeats of the proletariat was a greater force, producing demoralization throughout the party, and the bureaucracy prepared to expel the opposition before the congress even took place.</p><p>On 14th November the CC expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev from the party, together with virtually the entire Opposition. By December Zinoviev had parted company from Trotsky and capitulated to Stalin; on 18th December he appeared at the Congress to condemn his own views as ‘wrong and anti-Leninist’. Zinoviev was readmitted to the party in 1928 and appointed to an unimportant post in the Consumer Co-operatives, then to the Collegium of the Peoples Commissariat of Food. From then on he and Kamenev, who had capitulated with him, issued denunciations of the Left Opposition to the order of the bureaucracy. They had ceased to live politically.</p><p>However, during the period 1930-32 when the country was convulsed by the consequences of the forced collectivization begun in 1928, they began anxiously to discuss the dangers of the new policy. The development of the economic crisis led to a revival of opposition to Stalin within the apparatus itself; because of this weakening of its position the bureaucracy had to eliminate any candidates for leadership of any opposition group. For being in possession of a document emanating from the Right Opposition which bitterly attacked Stalin and collectivization, they were expelled from the party and exiled to Siberia. In 1933 they again recanted and prostrated themselves before Stalin; they were finally allowed to return to Moscow in May, broken men.</p><p>Stalin hoped to use Zinoviev as a means of striking against ‘Trotskyism’ and thereby consolidate the ranks of the bureaucracy. In December 1934 Zinoviev and Kamenev were arrested and brought before a military tribunal ‘in connection’ with the GPU-engineered assassination of Kirov (this was part of a campaign of harassment to force them to indict Trotsky); they were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment as the leaders of a mythical counter-revolutionary group.</p><p>Finally in August 1936 they were brought from the jails to be framed in the first of the Moscow show trials. After making a public ‘confession’, Zinoviev was sentenced to death for ‘organizing the joint Trotskyite-Zinovievist Terrorist Centre for the assassination of Soviet government and CPSU leaders’, and shot on August 21st, 1936.</p><p class="inline">Transcribed by David Walters, 2001</p><p>See <a href="../../../archive/zinoviev/index.htm" target="_top">Gregory Zinoviev Archive</a></p><p> </p><hr /><p class="footer"><a href="../../z.htm">Index of the Letter Z</a> | <a href="../../index.htm">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p></div></blockquote></body></html>')
