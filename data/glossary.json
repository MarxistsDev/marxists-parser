        "content": "\r\nMartin Abern (Abramowitz) was born on December 2, 1898 in Romania.\r\nHe came to the US at the age of 4, where his family settled in Minneapolis.\r\nAt 15, A. joined the IWW as well as the YPSL. When the US entered WWI,\r\nA. refused the draft and was for that reason expelled from the U of Minn.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe was sent to prison for six months for refusing the draft. Abern joined\r\nthe Left Wing of the SP, and then the young CP. At age 23, A. became the\r\nyoungest member of the CP's CC. Shortly thereafter he moved to Chicago\r\nand became active in the leadership of the CP's youth movement. He met\r\n<a href=\"../s/h.htm#shachtman-max\">Max Shachtman</a> when the latter was 19; they worked together in the National\r\nOffice of the Young Workers League. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Abern attended the Fourth Congress of the Comm. Int., where he was a delegate\r\nto the Second Congress of the Young Communist International. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>During his membership in the CP from 1923 to 1928, Abern supported <a href=\"../c/a.htm#cannon-james\">JP Cannon</a>\r\nin the split of the Foster-Cannon faction. Abern became a leading member\r\nof the Cannon faction. When Cannon became National Secretary of the International\r\nLabor Defense, Abern became his Assistant National Secretary. </p><p>\r\nA. was expelled from the CP for Trotskyism in 1928. That year, the Daily\r\nWorker referred to the three Trotskyists -- Cannon, Shachtman, and Abern\r\n-- as &quot;Three Generals Without an Army.&quot;</p><p>\r\nTogether with Maurice Spector of Canada, and others, Cannon, Shachtman,\r\nand Abern formed the Communist League of America in Chicago in May of 1929.\r\nIn 1938, the Trotskyists, having spent a brief time inside the American\r\nSP, formed the Socialist Workers Party. Abern served on the National and\r\nPolitical Committees of the SWP until the split of 1940, when he joined\r\nShachtman to form the Workers Party. The main issue in this split was Trotsky's\r\ninsistence on unconditional defense of Stalin's Soviet Russia. Cannon and\r\na majority of the SWP supported this notion, Shachtman, Abern, Gould, <a href=\"../g/l.htm#glotzer-albert\">Glotzer</a>,\r\nand many others, rejected it. </p><p>In the WP, Abern remained in the leadership until his death in 1949.\r\nThe May 9, 1949 issue of Labor Action, the WP's newspaper, carried an obituary\r\nby Max Shachtman that paid tribute to his long-time comrade. </p>\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\nAustrian Psychiatrist, creator of the system of <em>Individual  Psychology</em>; first to describe the &#8220;inferiority complex&#8221;. He developed a flexible method of psychotherapy to assist people to overcome feelings of inferiority, focussing on the relation of an individual to the goals and values determined by their social environment. </p>\n<p>Adler was born into a middle-class Jewish family, attending the same school as Sigmund Freud. He qualified as an eye doctor, but in 1902, joined <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Freud</a>&#8217;s Wednesday Psychological Society and brought the idea of &#8220;organ inferiority&#8221; from opthamology to psychology. Adler argued that a person&#8217;s sensitivity to the weakness of an organ led a person to dwell on it and generate excessive cerebral activity.</p>\n<p>Adler was married to Raissa Epstein, a Russian-born socialist; he was acquainted with Leon Trotsky when he was in exile in Vienna, was therapist to the Bolshevik Adolf Joffe and was a regular contributor to <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>, the Vienna daily socialist newspaper. His first book dealt with the social causes of physical illnesses.</p> \n<p>\nAfter his <span class=\"book\">Study of Organ Inferiority and Its Psychical Compensation</span> was published in 1907, his own views began to take shape independently, down-playing Freud&#8217;s insistence on the centrality of sexual conflicts in early childhood as the cause mental illness. For Adler it was a person&#8217;s striving for self-esteem and recognition that is central, and sexual problems were seen as expressing difficulties arising in this area.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1909, Adler was the first to argue that psychoanalysis supplied a complement to Marxism, and that sensitivity to slights provided a psychological basis for the development of class consciousness. Adler also tied the psychology of inferiority to the struggle for wmen&#8217;s rights. Influenced by his wife, the women&#8217;s movement and Social-Democracy, he reformulated his idea of organ-inferiority in terms of bisexuality. By &#8220;femininity,&#8221; he wrote, the neurotic &#8220;understands almost everything that is bad, certainly anything inferior.&#8221; Attempting to avoid what is pathological, that is, passive or &#8220;feminine,&#8221; the neurotic engaged in compensatory forms of self-assertion that Adler called &#8220;the masculine protest.&#8221; All neuroses &#8220;are derived and obtain their power from the battle between the feminine foundation and the masculine protest. ... one must assume the presence of the masculine protest in all women without exception ... since the devaluation of woman is the driving force in our civilisation. ... There is no principle more generally valid for all human relatiionships than &#8216;on top of&#8217; and &#8216;underneath&#8217;.&#8221; </p>\n<p>\nFrom 1911, Adler broke from Freud and became publicly critical of him and in 1912, coined the term <em>individual psychology</em> to characterise his own views, as set out in <span class=\"book\">The Neurotic Constitution</span>. </p>\n<p>\nAdler held that difficulties people encounter in gaining self-esteem and recognition, if not overcome by the normal means lead to compensatory behaviour and resultant personality disorders which are now widely referred to as an <em>inferiority complex</em>. </p>\n<p>\nThe other important elements of Adler&#8217;s psychology are <em>lifestyle</em> &#8211; the particular system of values and activities which a person acquires in their upbringing, and the <em>social interest drive</em> &#8211; an urge to cooperate with other people for the common good, which Adler took to be inherent in human beings. The method of therapy he used is simply to direct the patient&#8217;s attention to the unsuccessful, neurotic character of the way the patient is dealing with their feeling of inferiority, and assist the patient in restoring a feeling of self-esteem and in working out a realistic set of goals. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1934 the fascist government in Austria closed his 30 child guidance clinics. Many of his later writings, such as <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/at/adler.htm\" target=\"_top\">What Life Should Mean to You</a></span> (1931), were directed to the general reader. </p>\n\n\n"

His early writings, which emphasise aesthetic development as important to historical evolution, reflect the influence of <a href=\"../../people/b/e.htm#benjamin-walter\">Walter Benjamin</a>'s application of Marxism to cultural criticism. After teaching two years at the University of Frankfurt, Adorno immigrated to England in 1934 to escape the Nazi persecution of the Jews. He taught at the University of Oxford for three years and then went to the United States (1938), where he worked at Princeton (1938-41) and then was co-director of the Research Project on Social Discrimination at the University of California, Berkeley (1941-48). Adorno and his colleague Max Horkheimer returned to the University of Frankfurt in 1949. There they rebuilt the Institute for Social Research and revived the Frankfurt school of critical theory, which contributed to the German intellectual revival after World War II.  </p>\n<p>\nOne of Adorno's themes was civilisation's tendency to self-destruction, as evinced by Fascism. In their widely influential book <span class=\"book\">Dialectic of Enlightenment</span> (1947), Adorno and Horkheimer located this impulse in the concept of reason itself, which the Enlightenment and modern scientific thought had transformed into an irrational force that had come to dominate not only nature but humanity itself. The rationalisation of human society had ultimately led to Fascism and other totalitarian regimes that represented a complete negation of human freedom. Adorno concluded that rationalism offers little hope for human emancipation, which might come instead from art and the prospects it offers for preserving individual autonomy and happiness. Adorno's other major publications are <span class=\"book\">Philosophy of Modern Music</span> (1949), <span class=\"book\">The Authoritarian Personality</span> (1950, with others), <span class=\"book\">Negative Dialectics</span> (1966), and <span class=\"book\">Aesthetic Theory</span> (1970).  </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/adorno/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Theodor Adorno Archive</a></p> \n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../a.htm\">Index of the Letter A</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"

Masoud Ahmadzadeh engaged in political activities against the Pahlavi regime since he was a high school student. In 1965, Ahmadzadeh moved to Tehran to study mathematics in the University of Tehran where, together with his friends, including his friend of school years Amir Parviz Pouyan, refuted reformist policies propagated by nationalists and religious forces and drifted toward Marxism. In 1946, they formed a clandestine group to study Iranian socio-political and economic conditions, as well as classics of Marxism. In the same years Ahmadzadeh translated the Origin of Family, Private Property and Stat. He also wrote a pamphlet depicting the conclusion of the group. It tried to prove the land reform of 1963 was an imperialist plan that converted Iran from a semi-feudal semi-colonial country into a capitalist one. He also argues against the stereotypical models of organization and favors forming a political-military organization as the vanguard of proletariat. Later, the Iranian People&#8217;s Fadaee Guerrilla Organization was founded while Ahmadzadeh was a main founder, leader and theorist of it. He personally engaged in numerous military operations and was finally arrested by the secret police. He was brutally tortured but resisted the harsh conditions and defended his cause in the military court.

His innate intellectual brilliance, \r\nhowever, soon emancipated him into Freethought, from whence he moved rapidly to \r\nmarxism. Deceived for a while by the 'marxism' of H.M. Hyndman's \r\nsocial-chauvinist Social Democratic Federation, his grasp of the fundamental \r\nprinciples of marxism finally enabled him to break with the SDF. After an \r\nequally brief flirtation with the anarchists grouped around the paper Freedom, \r\nhis mercurial intellect forced him to split yet again, this time to form the \r\nCommunist Propaganda Group (CPG). The various local groups which emerged out of \r\nthe CPG's work suffered under the persecutions heaped upon them on account of \r\ntheir opposition to the First World War. The Central Glasgow group, however, \r\nmanaged to survive and, having fused with the Glasgow Anarchist Group, formed \r\nthe Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation. Unlike the Socialist Labour Party \r\nor the Socialist Workers' Federation, the APCF did not affiliate to the \r\nCommunist Party of Great Britain after its formation in 1921. Aldred left the \r\nAPCF in 1933, and after a split the remnant renamed itself the Workers' \r\nRevolutionary League. Aldred organised a Workers' Open Forum which eventually \r\nfused with dissident members of the Independent Labour Party to form the united \r\nSocialist Movement, and this published a journal, The Word, to which Aldred \r\ncontributed until his death. A prolific pamphleteer, his writings are worth \r\nreading, if only as examples of anti-parliamentary communist thought from a \r\nperiod in which Social Democracy in both its opposite reformist-constitutional \r\nand Leninist-revolutionary variants, (the latter having by then degenerated into \r\nits openly counter-revolutionary form known as Stalinism), enjoyed a virtually \r\nunchallenged hegemony within the 'marxist' Left.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Facing a hostile legislature, Allende proposed nationalisation of Chile&#8217;s vital copper mines, whose interests were sunk deep in the legislature. Opposition, including a strike by National Confederation of Lorry Owners, forced him to pull back. Allende then invited the Army into Cabinet and disarmed the militant copper miners.

Influential works: <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/althusser/works/formarx/althuss1.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">For Marx</span></a> (1965) and <span class=\"book\">Lenin and Philosophy</span> (1969). Attempted to reconcile Marxism with <a href=\"../../terms/s/t.htm#structuralism\">Structuralism</a> and is generally regarded as the foremost advocate of modern structuralism and main proponent of the idea that the &#8220;mature Marx&#8221; made a fundamental break with the romantic &#8220;<a href=\"../../terms/h/u.htm#humanism\">humanism</a>&#8221; of the &#8220;young Marx.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the time Althusser joined the Communist Party, <a href=\"../../people/s/a.htm#sartre-jean-paul\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, the former Existentialist who had fought in the Resistance, and his associate in <em>Les Temps Moderne</em>, the former Phenomenologist <a href=\"../../people/m/e.htm#merleau-ponty-maurice\">Maurice Merleau-Ponty</a>, were among a layer of intelligentsia aligning themselves with the USSR. In 1945 the PCF won some 25 percent of the vote in the first post-War election, and in 1946 took part in the Fourth Republic&#8217;s first government. After May 1947, when the PCF was dismissed from the Cabinet as the &#8220;Cold War&#8221; got under way, the PCF did not participate in any administration, though it won up to one-third and on average a quarter of the vote till 1968.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe dark post-war mood that lent existentialism its appeal faded when economic recovery set in, and in the boom-period of the 1960s it was replaced by a new vogue called structuralism, whose scientific pretensions better suited a technological age. Structuralism became an intellectual fashion in the 1960s in France, <a href=\"../j/a.htm#jakobson-roman\">Roman Jakobson</a>&#8217;s linguistic structuralism, <a href=\"../b/a.htm#barthes-roland\">Roland Barthes</a>&#8217; structuralist literary criticism and <a href=\"../l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude\">L&eacute;vi-Strauss</a>&#8217;s anthropological structuralism enjoyed widespread interest. Louis Althusser and his student <a href=\"../f/o.htm#foucault-michel\">Michel Foucault</a> were also regarded as representatives of this current. The structuralists stressed the persistence of &#8220;deep structures&#8221; that underlie all human cultures, leaving little room for either historical change or human initiative.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStarting from Marx&#8217;s criticism of empiricism, Althusser rejected the positive content of empirical knowledge entirely. Althusser asserts that Essence is not to be found in Appearance, but must be discovered through &#8217;theoretical practice&#8217; - &#8220;history features in [Marx&#8217;s] <span class=\"book\">Capital</span> as an object of theory, not as a real object, as an &#8217;abstract&#8217; (conceptual) object and not as a real-concrete object&quot;. Thus, as in Kant, the &#8217;real&#8217; history lies in a &#8217;beyond&#8217;, behind the &#8217;theory of history&#8217;, which is the only true object of knowledge. Althusser further rejects the concept of contradiction in Marx and Hegel, which he sees in structuralist terms as &#8220;over-determination&quot;. Althusser saw the early chapters of Marx&#8217;s <span class=\"book\">Capital</span> not as a key, but a barrier to understanding Marx&#8217;s view of capitalist society, advising readers to begin <span class=\"book\">Capital</span> with Part II. Althusser thus arrives not at a revision, but at a complete negation of Marx. <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/althusser/works/formarx/althuss1.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">On Marx</span></a> is the earliest work in which his criticism of Marx is put forward. His most influential works include <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/althusser/works/onmarx/althusse.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">For Marx</span></a> (1965) and <span class=\"book\">Lenin and Philosophy</span> (1969) including his article on &#8220;Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.&#8221; Marx&#8217;s humanism he viewed as a temporary, Feuerbachian phase, surpassed by commitment to the scientific observation of the structure of bourgeois society.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the same time, &#8220;Eurocommunism&#8221; became the trend among European communist parties during the 1970s and &#8217;80s, moving toward independence from Soviet Communist Party, basing policies instead on social forces within their own country. This tendency was encouraged by the decline in support Stalinist Parties commanded from the 1950s, the continued failure of Stalin&#8217;s regime to resolve the problems of the USSR, the repression of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 alienated many communists in the Western countries and was encouraged by the example of Tito&#8217;s Yugoslavia from 1948 on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe term Eurocommunism was coined in the mid-1970s and received wide publicity after the publication of <span class=\"book\">Eurocommunism and the State</span> (1977) by the Spanish Stalinist leader Santiago Carrillo.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the 1970s structuralism began to give way to a cluster of doctrines loosely labelled &#8220;post-structuralist,&#8221; each variety identified with its own master-thinker: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan.</p>\r\n<h5>Althusser&#8217;s Theory:<br />\r\nRelations of production &#8594; Apparatus &#8594; Ideology &#8594; Subject </h5>\r\n<p>Althusser&#8217;s concept of <em>subject</em> flows from his concept of <em>ideology</em>:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;ideology has the function (which defines it) of &#8216;constituting&#8217; concrete individuals as subjects, ideology being nothing but its functioning in the material forms of existence of that functioning.&#8221; <br />\r\n[Althusser 1971]</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">And ideology and subjectivity are in turn inseparable from <em>practice</em>:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;1. there is no practice except by and in an ideology; <br />\r\n2. there is no ideology except by the subject and for subjects.&#8221; <br />\r\n[Althusser 1971]</p>\r\n<p>And practice and ideology are to be understood in turn via his conception of the institutions in which practice takes place, the &#8220;Ideological State Apparatuses&#8221; (ISAs), institutions constituted by ideology, in which people&#8217;s activity is constituted as social practice. </p>\r\n<p>The state, in the orthodox, Marxist sense of the term, he calls the &#8220;Repressive State Apparatus&#8221; (RSA), the organisation of violence used by a (capitalist) ruling class in order to maintain conditions for the production and reproduction of the (capitalist) relations of production. The RSA and the ISAs are both <em>instruments</em> wielded by the state power, i.e., the dominant social class (the bourgeoisie); both function by means of both ideology and violence, violence acting as a last resort, but the Repressive SA is predominantly violent, while the Ideological SAs are predominantly ideological in their functioning. </p>\r\n<p>What are the ISAs? The Church, the Family, the Law, the political system including the various political parties, the Trade Unions, the Media, the &#8220;Cultural ISA&#8221; (including the artists and the various institutions which publish, teach, fund, display literature and art, etc.), and, according to Althusser, the dominant ISA &#8211;  the Education system. </p>\r\n<h5>Subjects</h5>\r\n<p>As an aside, note that in this conception, it is <em>classes</em> whose interest, consciousness and power is at work in society and history, so it would appear that Althusser sees classes as &#8220;subjects&#8221; in history. But at the same time he asserts that there are <em>no</em> subjects acting in history at all, that history is a process without a subject. In &#8220;Marxism and Humanism&#8221; he claims that in &#8220;the Marxist theory of history. The &#8216;subjects&#8217; of history are <em>given human societies</em>,&#8221; (recall that Marx himself rejected the idea of &#8216;society&#8217; as a coherent entity of any kind, let alone a subject). But Althusser signals that he does not share this conception by the placing of quotation marks around the word &#8216;subject&#8217;. Althusser also refutes, without very much difficulty, the idea that History is the work of an Hegelian Spirit or of a Subject (capital-S), Man, an idea which he ascribes to the &#8216;Young Marx&#8217;. If History is not to be the work of a (singular) <em>Subject</em>, then<em> ipso facto</em>, we are led to presume, there can be no subjects (plural) acting in history at all. </p>\r\n<p>Institutions, such as the state apparatus, are instruments which are <em>used</em> by the class which is the state power; classes wield power, struggle against one another and make alliances. Class struggle is a central concept for Althusser: &#8220;Ideologies always express <em>class</em> positions.&#8221; But Althusser does not hold that a class acting as &#8220;a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions&#8221; (to use Althusser&#8217;s own definition) warrants it being called a subject. He talks of classes <em>as if</em> they were subjects (they have interests, they struggle, they have consciousness), but for Descartes, limits the notion of subject to <em>concrete individuals</em>. But in the case of the individual subject, as we shall see, being a subject does not mean what it might be supposed to mean.</p>\r\n<p>By his rejection of the concept of a <em>singular</em> Subject at work in history (God, for all intents and purposes), Althusser sees himself as having done with all notions of a <em>collective</em> subject, whether it be a &#8216;scientific&#8217; conception of <em>collective</em> subjects (such as nations, social movements, institutions or social classes) or &#8216;spiritual&#8217; conceptions such as that of Hegel. Just as for Kant and Descartes, for Althusser, subjects are individuals; the question is only what being such a subject can amount to. </p>\r\n<p>What Althusser has left out is any consideration of whether, by combining together in some rational form of voluntary collectivity, some self-conscious system of activity or social movement, people can rise to a level where they are capable of becoming collectively, &#8220;a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions&#8221; and become to some extent subjects in their own lives, collectively. Grand ensembles, like &#8216;Man&#8217; or &#8216;Society&#8217;, can only be understood as subjects if one adopts a spiritualistic conception. Lukacs&#8217; conception of the working class as a subject in history depended on the reality of the Communist International being the actual leadership of an international workers&#8217; movement, a movement in which millions of individuals saw themselves as communists, actively looked to the Comintern for leadership and transmitted that commitment to those around them. That reality proved to be transitory if not entirely illusory.</p>\r\n<p>But all sorts of corporate entities, from nations to companies, <em>do</em> act as subjects, as well as more diffuse social movements. But isn&#8217;t there room for a concept of subjects which lies <em>between</em> the mysticism of &#8220;Geist&#8221; and idealism of the Kantian transcendental subject, <em>between</em> the romanticism of &#8220;Man&#8221; and the positivism of the Individual? This is territory into which Althusser does not venture.</p>\r\n<h5>Apparatuses</h5>\r\n<p>Although all the social institutions are called Ideological <em>State</em> Apparatuses, they may be public or private, formal or informal, because they function to reproduce the capitalist relations of production, and therefore serve the interests of the capitalist class; so they are deemed <em>state</em> apparatuses. Althusser was writing in the 1960s and 1970s, a time when the (Keynesian Welfare) capitalist state rested to a large degree on the trade unions, and when there was a high degree of social integration. The intense class conflict following the end of World War II had ended, as the Marshall Plan was used to suppress popular discontent in Europe. This brought a kind of peace and prosperity to the masses which made capitalism look homogeneous, the same situation which had prompted Herbert Marcuse to write &#8220;One Dimensional Man.&#8221; In this conjuncture, it was probably not controversial on the Left for Althusser to include the Trade Unions as an Ideological State Apparatus, as part of the system of ideological domination by the bourgeoisie. Under Khrushchev&#8217;s policy of &#8216;peaceful co-existence&#8217;, the French Communist Party and the PCF-controlled CGT could be included in that characterisation. The idea that the Family is the bedrock of capitalist society is still widespread; but the inclusion of the arts as a &#8220;cultural ideological state apparatus&#8221; makes it clear enough that <em>any</em> institution to be found in capitalist society is <em>ipso facto</em> an apparatus by means of which the bourgeoisie maintain bourgeois relations of production. &#8216;The system&#8217; is all-pervasive.</p>\r\n<p>And this is the point really. Is it reasonable to paint a picture of modern society which is so utterly closed to criticism, so homogeneous, so impenetrable? Is absolutely every route to change closed in advance?</p>\r\n<h5>Ideology</h5>\r\n<p>In a way somewhat similar to how a &#8216;discourse&#8217; constitutes an institution, for Althusser, each of the institutions he refers to as ISAs correspond to an <em>ideology</em>, a religious, ethical, legal, political or whatever ideology, whose material existence is the rituals and practices of the corresponding ISA, organised around a concept of God, Law, Art or whatever. An ideology expresses a class position through a specific regular form of material practice (ISA), which functions ideologically to ensure the reproduction of capitalism, and is backed up by violence, either internally, or through the RSA. </p>\r\n<p>But (and this is a virtue of Althusser&#8217;s approach) all the ISAs are <em>relatively autonomous</em> with respect to one another. Although each serves to facilitate the reproduction of elements of the capitalist relations of production, they are not purely and simply generated by the capitalist mode of production, understood as an &#8216;expressive totality&#8217;. Each apparatus has its own logic and operates to some degree independently of the others.</p>\r\n<p>Each ISA, with its various &#8216;rituals&#8217; and characteristic forms of practice, constitutes the material existence of the relevant ideology: Art (the ideology of art) is materially constituted by the practices of the art world &#8211; its methods of evaluation, control, distribution and production, and so forth. The objective material actions of individuals performing these (or other) practises constitute what could be called the ideas which make up this ideology. </p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\"> &#8220;[An individual&#8217;s] ideas are his material actions inserted into material practices governed by material rituals which are themselves defined by the material ideological apparatus from which derive the ideas of that subject.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Discourse is the medium of ideology, and consciousness is internal verbal discourse. Thus consciousness is an internalisation of the material practices of the ISAs in which a person participates, language being the principal transmission mechanism for this process of internalisation. </p>\r\n<h5>Science</h5>\r\n<p>But this leads to a difficulty surely? How is it possible to distinguish Science from Ideology? By definition:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\"> &#8220;Ideology represents the imaginary <b>relationship</b> of individuals to their real conditions of existence.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>All ideologies are &#8220;myths&#8221; which &#8220;do not correspond to reality&#8221; and are &#8220;illusions.&#8221; But Althusser <em>counterposes</em> Ideology to <em>Science</em>, which, he says, is <em>not</em> ideology. &#8220;Religious ideology, ethical ideology, legal ideology, political ideology&#8221; are &#8220;timeless&#8221; &#8220;world outlooks,&#8221; and:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\"> &#8220;assuming that we do not live one of these ideologies as the truth (e.g. &#8216;believe&#8217; in God, Duty, Justice, etc....), we admit that the ideology we are discussing from a critical point of view, examining it as the ethnologist examines the myths of a &#8216;primitive society&#8217;, that these &#8216;world outlooks&#8217; are largely imaginary, i.e. do not &#8216;correspond to reality&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Science provides us with a means of knowing things because it presents a true representation of our relationship to our conditions of existence, whereas ideology can describe things, but only by means of a false relationship to our conditions:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;an ideology is a system (with its own logic and rigour) of representations (images, myths, ideas or concepts, depending on the case) endowed with a historical existence and role within a given society. ... ideology, as a system of representations, is distinguished from science in that in it the practico-social function is more important than the theoretical function (function as knowledge).&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Surely the only possible way of making sense of this is to allow that with science, just as with education, politics, literature, and so on, there are forms of practice, constituted in some kind of apparatus, acts within which constitute the ideas of <em>science</em>? How can science be any different in this respect? How can science not be constituted in regular, institutionalised forms of practice with its own scientific discourse? But this is not how Althusser sees it.</p>\r\n<p>According to Althusser, Ideology is the &#8216;lived&#8217; relation between men and their world, an unconscious relation which may or may not be reflected in the form of a systematic &#8216;philosophy&#8217;. Ideology is distinguished from a science not by its falsity or incoherence, but by the fact that the work of <em>reproduction of the relations of production</em>, predominates in it over <em>theoretical practice</em>, over knowledge production. Each science arises out of the pre-scientific world of ideas, out of ideology, by means of what Althusser calls the <em>epistemological break</em>, a &#8216;leap&#8217; which entails a radical break from the whole previous frame of reference, and the construction of a new problematic. Ideology survives alongside science as an element of the social formation.</p>\r\n<p>Althusser sees (scientific) theoretical practice as a fourth practice, over and above the economic, political and ideological practices which together constitute a social formation. The work of theoretical practice is to transform ideology into knowledge, criticising the timeless conceptions of ideology which indicate objects but fail to open them to understanding. </p>\r\n<p>However, just as wage workers are not &#8216;subjects&#8217; of their own labor, being nothing more than factors of production organised by capital, which is responsible for the process of production, science is a <em>subjectless</em> process which brings together and activates all the components and conditions of scientific practice. The individuals who actually perform the work cannot claim to be &#8216;subjects&#8217; of their scientific production, any more than wage workers are subjects of economic production. In both cases the individuals are mere bearers of a practico-social process.</p>\r\n<p>But surely this only makes sense if we consider that systematic thought <em>in general</em> (and not just myths), thought which brings to light the <em>real </em>relationship of individuals to their conditions of existence (as opposed to imaginary relationships), thought which is not timeless and impervious to history, but on the contrary is <em>historical</em>, <em>scientific</em> thought, is <em>also</em> to be understood as constituted in certain, relatively autonomous, regular forms of practice, with its own &#8216;scientific world outlook&#8217;?</p>\r\n<p>Althusser designates science as a practice (like economics, politics and ideology) but it is entirely unclear how scientific discourse and scientific practice, carried out by individuals who are <em>not subjects</em>, authors of or responsible for their actions, constitutes the ideas of science, but can be in some way qualitatively different from ideology. It seems that science, which discloses the real relation of people to their conditions of existence, is just as much tied up with class relations as ideology which &#8220;always expresses <em>class</em> positions.&#8221; But Althusser makes no suggestion that a proletarian class interest detracts from the scientific character of a theoretical work. In order to be <em>objective</em>, science must be beliefs and actions <em>without subjects</em>, a subject-less discourse and a subjectless practice. So the author of scientific work, who is an individual person, and therefore a &#8220;subject,&#8221; and therefore ideological, &#8220;is completely absent as a &#8216;subject&#8217; from &#8216;his&#8217; scientific discourse.&#8221; The individual scientist is just a cog in the machinery of science. A lot of scientific work nowadays, of course, looks just like a manufacturing industry production line, with PhDs handed out much like trades apprenticeships, but can the entire process be represented in that way, at every level? </p>\r\n<p>In the Preface to <em>Capital</em> Volume One, Althusser goes on to claim that &#8220;The struggle for Marxist science and Marxist philosophy is today, as it was yesterday, a form of political and ideological class struggle.&#8221; But Science remains subjectless even while it serves the class struggle, and is permeated with a class position, that of the proletariat. The identification of science with socialism was still uncontroversial in Althusser&#8217;s day, but that has long since ceased to be the case, thanks in some measure to the &#8216;socialist humanists&#8217; who Althusser was opposing. </p>\r\n<p>Althusser sees <em>Capital</em> as a work of science (as did Marx), and in his terms, to describe <em>Capital</em> as a work of ethics, would be tantamount to condemning it as ideological; <em>all</em> ethics is ideological for Althusser. But by making an absolute out of science, Althusser himself has fallen prey to Ideology. All knowledge is <em>for something</em>; knowledge arises only in connection with certain forms of activity and not others. So a conception of science which isolates science from ethics is abstract and self-delusion.</p>\r\n<h5>Ideology</h5>\r\n<p>For Althusser, being a subject, &#8216;believing in&#8217; an ideology, and participating in the ritual and practices of an Ideological Apparatus are all one and the same:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;the decisive central term on which everything else depends is the notion of the <em>subject</em>.  ... the category of subject ... is the constitutive category of all ideology, ... only ... insofar as all ideology has the function (which defines it) of &#8216;constituting&#8217; concrete individuals as subjects, ideology being nothing but its functioning in the material forms of existence of that functioning.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Already in this formulation, we can see how &#8216;subjects&#8217; in Althusser&#8217;s understanding, far from really being free, responsible agents, are <em>subjected</em> beings. And subjects are individual human beings, not classes or nations:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The individual ... behaves in such and such a way, adopts such and such a practical attitude, and, what is more, participates in certain regular practices which are those of the ideological apparatus on which &#8216;depend&#8217; the ideas which he has in all consciousness freely chosen as a subject. ... and freely accepts, must &#8216;<em>act</em> according to his ideas&#8217;, must therefore inscribe his own ideas as a free subject in the actions of his material practice. ... these practices are governed by the <em>rituals</em> in which these practices are inscribed, within the <em>material existence of an ideological apparatus</em>.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Only a concrete individual person can be a subject, but to be a subject the individual must be taken up by forms of practice constituted by <em>timeless</em> ideologies, ideologies for which there is &#8216;no outside&#8217;, constituting an imaginary relationship of the individual to their real conditions of existence and functionally determined as ideological apparatuses for the maintenance of the dominant, capitalist mode of production. </p>\r\n<p>Despite the relative independence of the various ideological and repressive apparatuses, they form a closed universe in which no consciousness is possible other than an illusory, functionally prescribed, bourgeois consciousness. The individual subject&#8217;s belief that they act of their own free will is an illusion. Even before they are born, they are destined to bear their father&#8217;s name, their role is determined before they know it themselves &#8211; their gender, their abilities, their family, etc. &#8211; the subject is always-already the subject they come to know themselves as, when they are called, and &#8216;find their place&#8217; in society by being inserted into a position an Ideological State Apparatus. This is the process which Althusser calls &#8216;interpellation&#8217; &#8211; the individual&#8217;s recognition of themselves as answering to an identity ascribed to them by the Ideological State Apparatus, materially, the insertion or subsumption of their activity into practices constituting the ISA. </p>\r\n<p>Althusser takes Christianity an as an &#8220;example&#8221; of an ideology, claiming that &#8220;the same demonstration can be produced for ethical, political, aesthetic ideology, etc.,&#8221; and then goes on to make points about religion which are claimed without demonstration to be also applicable to (EG) ethics. So &#8220;there can only be such a multitude of possible religious subjects on the absolute condition that there is a Unique, Absolute, <em>Other Subject</em>, i.e. God.&#8221;  So we have each ISA as constituted by a Principle &#8211; God in the Christian Church &#8211; to which subjects are subjected when they are socialised into practice and rituals within the given ISA. Through the subjects&#8217; recognition of the &#8220;Subject&#8221; (capital-S, i.e., God or Law or Art, etc.) and each other, individuals come to recognise themselves as subjects. On this basis, with the absolute certainty of a closed world, the subjects are free to &#8220;work by themselves.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>The question has to asked though, is the fact (if we take it to be a fact) that a person operates within what could be called a shared system of illusions, they are ipso facto incapable of being genuinely the morally responsible initiator of their actions, and that they are completely incapable in exercising rational control over their destiny? </p>\r\n<h5>The Subjected Subject </h5>\r\n<p>As a good structuralist, Althusser can cap off his &#8220;proof&#8221; of the subjected character of the self-deluded subject with an archetypical sleight of hand of the kind so popular among French structuralists:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\"> &#8220;... The whole mystery of this effect lies ... in the ambiguity of the term <em>subject.</em> In the ordinary use of the term, subject in fact means: (1) <b>a free subjectivity, a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions</b>; (2) <b>a subjected being, who submits to a higher authority</b>, and is therefore stripped of all freedom except that of freely accepting his submission. ... the individual <em>is interpellated as a</em> (<em>free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject</em>, <em>i.e. in order that he shall (freely)</em> <em>accept his subjection</em>, ...</p>\r\n<p>But of course the two opposite meanings of the word &#8220;subject&#8221; have quite different genealogies. Descartes, criticising Aristotle, used the Latin translation of Aristotle&#8217;s <span class=\"greek\">upokeimenon</span> (<em>hypokeimenon</em>), <em>subjectum</em>, to mean the substance (<em>substantia</em>) to which all attributes adhered, i.e., (for Descartes) the individual self-consciousness and cogito; Kant went on to define this subject as the sovereign individual, the &#8220;free subjectivity, a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions.&#8221; This meaning of the word &#8220;subject&#8221; has continued in use, but exclusively within philosophical discourse and only in fairly recent times has it penetrated a broader audience.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, &#8220;subject&#8221; entered the English language in the 14th century in the sense of someone under the dominion of or owing allegiance to a sovereign power, being <em>subject</em> to its laws, enjoying its protection. At this time, &#8220;subjectum&#8221; was understood in the Aristotlean sense, prior to Descartes transformation of the subject into an active agent within a philosophical discourse. In ordinary usage, &#8220;subject&#8221; retained this passive meaning, and took on further usages, such as being the subject of a poem or an accusation or being subjected to taxes, and so on. </p>\r\n<p>Rather than an ambiguity, what we have is effectively two different words, two different concepts. The connection between the two meanings of &#8220;subject&#8221; is <em>historical</em>, not logical. It is nothing more than a structuralist trick to suggest a necessary connection to <em>being a subject</em> (i.e., a self-conscious, knowing author of one&#8217;s own actions) and <em>being subjected</em> to a higher authority. The two meaning, while not absolutely incompatible, are opposite in their meaning and have different contexts.</p>\r\n<h5>Agency</h5>\r\n<p>Althusser&#8217;s solution to this riddle entails the conception that while he, Althusser, is but a humble subject, nevertheless, as a scientist, he is able to participate in and be mouthpiece or vehicle for science. Science in his conception is not an Ideology, but truth, and as such is a process without a subject; it is subjectless, an objective process. But its truths find their way into print via the pens of humble subjects who should not delude themselves about having made a discovery or having been responsible for creating anything. This despite the claim that science is only possible &#8220;from a proletarian class viewpoint, and with the new practice of philosophy that follows from it.&#8221; [Althusser 1971]</p>\r\n<p>This leads to the absurd and reactionary position that Althusser must teach his students a scientific point of view, namely that history is a process without a subject, but at the same tell them that the working class can rise only to the level of socialist humanism, an <em>ideology</em>, and encourage his readers to keep science to themselves, and propagate ideology to the workers instead. </p>\r\n<p>In <em>Marxism and Humanism</em>, Althusser explains that &#8220;even a communist society could ever do without ideology, be it ethics, art or &#8216;world outlook&#8217;&#8221;:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;... it is not conceivable that communism, a new mode of production implying determinate forces of production and relations of production, could do without a social organization of production, and corresponding ideological forms. / So ideology is ... a structure essential to the historical life of societies.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>So for Althusser, ideology is somewhat like Plato&#8217;s &#8216;beautiful lies&#8217;, the Christianity of Hobbes and Kant, Robespierre&#8217;s &#8216;Festival of the Supreme Being&#8217; or August Comte&#8217;s &#8216;Religion of Humanity&#8217; &#8211; popular illusions necessary to maintain the institutions of society; the philosopher doesn&#8217;t believe in it, but for practical purposes people have to be persuaded to believe in it, just like people have to believe in the necessity of driving on the left hand side of the road, even though science tells us that the right hand side would be just as good. This overstates the case a little, because Althusser accepts that not only is socialist humanism necessary for the proper functioning of the institutions of socialist society, but:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;When I say that the concept of humanism is an ideological concept (not a scientific one), I mean that while it really does<em> designate a set of existing relations</em>, unlike a scientific concept, it does not <em>provide us with a means of knowing them</em>.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, it would seem hard to see why a &#8216;scientific concept&#8217; which does &#8216;provide us with a means of knowing&#8217; existing relations, cannot also function as the &#8216;relay whereby ... the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the profit of all&#8217;. Are we really &#8220;bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society&#8221; (to quote Marx&#8217;s description of materialism in &#8220;Theses on Feuerbach&#8221; No. 3)?</p>\r\n<p>The problem here is that communism is not for Althusser a struggle for self-emancipation, but rather just a process without a subject, a process leading from one set of institutions to another, and under such conditions, the very notion of &#8216;emancipation&#8217; is meaningless.</p>\r\n<p>Althusser was writing not long after Jean-Paul Sartre published his <em>Critique of Dialectical Reason</em>, and it can be seen how Althusser and Sartre confront similar problems and share many of the same assumptions, but they come to different conclusions. Sartre is trying to grapple with how mass social movements &#8211; &#8216;fused groups&#8217; &#8211; which are real, living expressions of subjectivity, become eventually transformed into a reactionary and ossified bureaucracy like the USSR. Althusser sees the USSR as en route to socialist society via the withering away of the state, and characterises opponents of the bureaucracy as unscientific ideologues. One gets a real feeling of discomfort as Sartre wrestles with these problems. Not so Louis Althusser, who even puts the word &#8216;abuses&#8217; in inverted commas in referring to the crimes of the Stalin period &#8211; after all, these were just problems in the superstructure, not the real foundations of socialism. Ha! Althusser greeted the student uprisings of May/June 1968 firstly with silence, later describing them as infantile Leftism. Sartre perhaps just went a little overboard in his enthusiastic support of the students.</p>\r\n<p>The idea that every aspect culture in capitalist societies is completely determined by bourgeois ideology, leaving no room at all for social movements which genuinely challenge capitalism, was a powerful idea in its day; an idea which both <em>expressed</em> and <em>supported</em> the strength of bourgeois society. The idea that the only threat to capitalism came from an entrenched bureaucracy in the USSR and China, was also plausible in its day, being expressive of mainstream bourgeois ideology and an important prop for capitalism. The idea that humanist criticisms of Stalinism and capitalism were just unscientific delusions, whilst truth was available only thanks to the work of a privileged stratum of &#8216;scientists&#8217; expressed the spirit of certain social layers for a time. Nothing could better express the ethos of contemporary capitalism (from the point of view of those suffering its injustices) than a theory that explains that individuals are nothing but deluded pawns of the system and that if there is anything to be done about the situation at all, then it has to be left to the experts. </p>\r\n<p>The question has to be asked though, at <em>what point</em>, coming down from epochal shifts in history, to changes in government, to events in union branches or workplaces to deciding when to have lunch, is there room for free will? Self-evidently, there is some dividing line, but nothing in Althusser makes it possible to work out where such a dividing line could lie. Equally, given their social position, at what point is an agent simply choosing to do what, in any case, they <em>had to do</em>, or what their previous actions had inevitably led them to do, and at what point is the agent&#8217;s well-chosen or mistaken action an original factor in the situation not to be understood in any other way than as the result of their intervention? </p>\r\n<p>There may be only one road across the Alps but Hannibal still had to find it.</p>\r\n<h5>Real Issues</h5>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Althusser raises some real problems. Looked at from a distance, from outside, the impact of individuals on the course of history does appear as nothing more than a bit of a wiggle on the historical trajectory, so to speak. History does appear to unfold according to laws which can be the object if science, law which cannot be altered by the intervention of individual subjects.</p>\r\n<p>Consequently, the only sense in which consciousness determines the course of history seems to be as ideology, as the &#8216;lived&#8217; relation of people to their world, which functions to coordinate practice within the various social formations, whether &#8220;Ideological State Apparatuses&#8221; or revolutionary social movements. &#8220;Theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses,&#8221; (Marx) but not when necessarily only it is true. History is made by the movement of masses of people, and such movements are constituted by shared systems of belief which can rightly be called &#8216;ideology&#8217; in as much as their principal function is not theoretical but &#8216;practico-social&#8217;. Masses of people, moved by ideology which from an outsider&#8217;s point of view represents only an imaginary relation of people to their conditions of existence, can indeed make history, and in doing so such movements more closely resemble tidal movements than they resemble self-conscious, knowing, sovereign actors. But isn&#8217;t science also capable of moving masses? And doesn&#8217;t the project of emancipation require that science and not self-deception be the weapon of choice?</p>\r\n<p>Althusser&#8217;s theory leads to some horrific and counter-intuitive conclusions: that scientific ideas are not suitable for general distribution, that <em>ideology</em> should instead be promoted for general distribution, that the scientist is as much a creature of ideology as anyone else and that he or she is not the creator, but mere bearer of the science she or he produces, that history unfolds as an entirely objective process, with no subjective component at all, or even openings for subjective intervention. That is, history and society is a natural process which science can understand and control, but even science itself develops as a natural process just like its objects.</p>\r\n<p>But it is not sufficient to respond to Althusser with a conception of individuals as sovereign subjects, answerable only to laws of their own making (Kant). And nor can we rely on a conception of a collective subject, such as a Communist Party, which is not subject internally to social processes and is able to stand outside and above society. Nevertheless, it is in this &#8216;third position&#8217;, between the World Spirit or Man &#8211; mystical extramundane forces working behind the backs of human actors &#8211; and the Individual Subject known to common sense, that we must find a way out. Collective subjects do not stand outside society but rather their very substance is practical human life; all social life is, on the other hand, animated by the interpenetration and mutual transformation of a multiplicity of social subjects. Collective subjects have no consciousness, no feeling, no will or intentions, other than those of the individual participants who are instances of them as social subjects. Collective subjects have no ideas or culture, no means other than what is objectified in the mass of cultural objects created and used in the course of social practice.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/althusser/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Louis Althusser Archive</a> and <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/althusser/glossary.htm\" target=\"_top\">Louis Althusser Glossary of Terms</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n"

In 1901, he became a member of the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america\">Socialist Party of America</a> (SPA) until he moved to Germany in 1903. While in Germany he edited the <em>German Export Review</em> and became a member of the<a href=\"../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp\">Social Democratic Party</a>. He also studied music at the Leipzig Conservatory where in 1912 he created a never performed opera called Winona about a romance between a United States Army Officer and a Native American woman known as Winona. (The manuscript score resides in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter returned to the United States when Germany entered the war. In 1917 he rejoined the Socialist Party and was an active member of the Left Wing Section when it emerged in 1919. Amter was a founding member of the Communist Party of America from its founding convention in September 1919. Amter seems to have followed the faction around <a href=\"../r/u.htm#ruthenberg\">C.E. Ruthenberg</a> out of the party in April 1920, becoming a member of the United Communist Party (UCP). In November of 1920 he was named to the editorial committee of the UCP. On April 29, 1921, Amter was arrested along with three others in a raid on the UCP&#8217;s covert headquarters in New York by New York bomb squad detectives and Department of Justice agents. Amter was charged in the incident and released on bail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter was a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the unified Communist Party of America from 1922. He was an adherent of the system of underground party organization and was factionally associated with Abram Jakira, L.E. Katterfeld, Alfred <a href=\"../w/a.htm#wagenknecht\">Wagenknecht</a>, and Edward Lindgren in this period in a tendency commonly and somewhat derisively known as the &#8220;Goose Caucus.&#8221; Although this faction nominally won the day at the ill-fated 1922 Bridgman Convention, assuring the preservation of the underground party, in actuality the victory was Pyrrhic&#8212;in the competition between the parallel above ground and underground party apparatuses, the legal Workers Party of America (WPA) headed by C.E. Ruthenberg grew steadily, while the underground organization atrophied, to be terminated in 1923. NB: Underground functions continued to be performed by a narrow circle within the Communist organization after the demise of the formal underground CPA organization, although the parallel party apparatus was liquidated at a one day convention held in New York City on April 7, 1923.[3]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter was the representative of the WPA to the orgs <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international\">Communist International (Comintern)</a> from 1923-24 and served as the ECCI referent [mediator] on questions the English and American parties. He was a delegate to the 3rd Enlarged Plenum of ECCI and was a delegate to the 5th World Congress of the Communist International in 1924. During the factional struggles of the middle 1920s, Amter seems to have cast his lot with the Ruthenberg-Lovestone faction. He was the Cleveland District Organizer of the Communist (Workers) Party in 1927. During the early years of the Great Depression, Amter was active in the Communist Party&#8217;s Unemployed Councils movement and was arrested in New York City on March 6, 1930 along with William Z. Foster and Robert Minor in connection with a public demonstrations of that organization. Amter was ultimately sentenced on April 21, 1930 to a term of &#8220;6 months to 3 years&#8221; in connection with the riot which had ensued. He was released from jail on October 21, 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter was a frequent candidate of the Communist Party for various political offices. The first came in 1928 when he ran for Senator of Ohio under an unknown political affiliation. He managed to receive 2,062 votes, about .09% of the popular vote. He also ran for New York Borough President in 1931, for Governor of New York in 1932, 1934, and 1942. He ran again for the New York Board of Aldermen in 1936 and for theUS Senate from New York in 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter developed Parkinson&#8217;s Disease in the 1940s. He was indicted under the Smith Act prosecutions of the Communist Party&#8217;s leadership in 1951, but was severed from the case due to his illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amter died November 24, 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His name is mentioned in the poem &#8220;America&#8221; by Allen Ginsberg who writes, &#8220;I once saw Israel Amter plain.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">[Composed by Tim Davenport]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../a.htm\">Index of the Letter A</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

The circle around his bookshop were among those who founded the Communist Party of Australia in 1920.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn May 1886 David Andrade, his brother Will and half a dozen others formed the Melbourne Anarchist Club, the first anarchist organisation in Australia. Andrade became the MAC secretary and one of its main propagandists. The club produced the journal <em>Honesty</em> which gave club news as well as publishing theoretical articles and Andrade was a regular contributor. Along with his brother, David Andrade followed the booksellers trade. In a news agency at Brunswick and later in Liberty Hall, Russell St. Melbourne the brothers operated the first anarchist book shops in Australia. Here they loaned and sold anarchist publications with their publicity noting that &#8220;Socialistic Literature of all kinds (both Communist, Collectivist and Anarchist) are well represented, both in books and pamphlets, and newspapers supplied from all parts of the world.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAndrade was an energetic and flamboyant personality who deeply immersed himself in the anarchist activities of the day and was a writer, publisher, printer, distributor, organiser, general propagandist and activist for the anarchist cause. Aside from his contributions to Honesty Andrade&#8217;s writings were published in a &#8220;wide variety of local and overseas journals.&#8221; His main works include &#8220;Money: a study of the currency question&#8221; (1887), &#8220;Our Social System&#8221; which was an attack on monopoly in both land ownership and usury, and &#8220;An Anarchist Plan of Campaign&#8221; (1888). In 1892 he published the &#8220;realistic&#8221; novel &#8216;The Melbourne Riots and how Harry Holdfast and his friends emancipated the workers.&#8217; Both The Melbourne Riots and David Andrade have been recently described as &#8220;utopian.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAndrade was a major participant in the split in MAC in 1888 and was in conflict with J.A. Andrews and other anarcho-communists. The cause of the split in the MAC was over the &#8220;forcible reclamation and defence of liberty&#8221; &#8211; in other words violence. Andrade has been variously described as a &#8220;Proudhonist&#8221; and a &#8220;mutualist&#8221; and was at this time and afterwards vehemently opposed to any form of violence. He appears to have been isolated by the split and the publication of Honesty ceased with Andrade taking control of the plant. MAC member and anarcho communist Larry Petrie later described the club as basically &#8220;Tolstoyan.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the split Andrade continued his work writing, publishing and bookselling. In the early 1890s he was the secretary of the Unemployed Workers Association in Richmond and in 1893 as an outspoken member of a deputation of the unemployed bitterly attacked the system of representative government &#8220;We are ruled by a lot of robbers, and when I see a man go into Parliament I feel sorry for him, for he only makes another of the nest of vermin... Our legislators are more degraded than a person who abuses a woman or a child and I have no confidence in them.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLater that year he had taken up a small selection of 10 acres in the Dandenong Ranges where he began clearing the land, building a house and working as a storekeeper and a mailman. His second son Proudhon Andrade was born here in a rough shelter the same year. Andrade persisted in this lifestyle for five years but was burnt out in the disastrous 1898 fires. He appears to have been financially ruined and mentally broken by this event. In 1903 he was admitted to the Yarra Bend Asylum and he lived for the rest of his life in asylums. He died in 1928 and in later years was described as a kind man with a smile on his face. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.takver.com/history/\" target=\"_top\">Radical Tradition</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n"

Under Andropov the KGB became much more effective in suppression of dissents through the use of more subtle means of pressure and intelligence, but allowed large numbers of dissidents to leave the USSR and work from abroad. Under Andropov, the KGB also worked to restrain the &#8216;Brezhnev mafia&#8217;, including the arrest of Brezhnev&#8217;s daughter for corruption.

As head of state, Andropov initiated a campaign against &#8220;absenteeism, idleness, drunkenness, etc\" and crime but succeeded only in generating opposition and an atmosphere of fear.

During this period Antonov-Ovseenko began to question the political system that existed in Russia and in 1901 was expelled from college for refusing to take the oath of loyalty to Nicholas II. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAntonov-Ovseenko moved to Warsaw where he joined the illegal Social Democratic Labour Party. The following year he found work as a labourer in the Alexander Docks in St. Petersburg and then as a coachman for the Society for the Protection of Animals.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt its Second Congress of the Social Democratic Labour Party in London in 1903, Antonov-Ovseenko, along with Plekhanov, Pavel Axelrod, Leon Trotsky, Vera Zasulich, Irakli Tsereteli, Moisei Uritsky, Noi Zhordania and Fedor Dan, supported Julius Martov&#8217;s Menshevik position. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn August 1904 Antonov-Ovseenko was arrested for distributing illegal political propaganda. He was released and sent to Warsaw where he became a junior officer in the Kolyvan Infantry Regiment. He used his position to recruit junior officers to the Mensheviks. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAntonov-Ovseenko deserted from the army during the 1905 Revolution. He joined the Menshevik Military Committee and edited the underground newspaper Kazarma (Garrison). However, he was arrested in April, 1906, but escaped from Sushchevsky Prison. Captured again in June, he was sentenced to death (later commuted to twenty years hard labour in Siberia).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn June, 1907, a group of Mensheviks freed Antonov-Ovseenko by blowing a hole in the prison wall. He spent some time hiding in Finland until he could be provided with a false passport that would enable him to return to Russia. Based in Moscow he organized workers&#8217; cooperatives and editing illegal newspapers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter two further arrests Antonov-Ovseenko left Russia and went to live in France. He joined other revolutionaries in exile and as well as becoming secretary of the Parisian Labour Bureau wrote for the radical newspaper, <em>Golos</em> (Voice).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAntonov-Ovseenko returned to Russia after the February Revolution. In May he joined the Bolsheviks and soon afterwards was appointed to the party&#8217;s Central Committee. Antonov-Ovseenko was the main architect of the armed insurrection and led the Red Guards that seized the Winter Palace on the 25th October, 1917. After the October Revolution he was appointed Commissar for Military Affairs in Petrograd and Commisssar of War.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the Civil War Antonov-Ovseenko commanded the Bolshevik campaign in the Ukraine and organized famine relief in Samara province. Antonov-Ovseenko worked closely with Leon Trotsky and in 1922 he was appointed Chief of Political Administration of the Red Army.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the Communist Party Congress in 1922 Antonov-Ovseenko attacked Lenin for making political compromises with the kulaks and foreign capitalism. He also supported the idea of permanent revolution and became one of the leaders of the left opposition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs a supporter of Leon Trotsky, Antonov-Ovseenko lost his military command in 1923. To remove him from the political struggle in the Soviet Union, in 1925 Joseph Stalin sent him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Later he held similar posts in Lithuania and Poland. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAntonov-Ovseenko was the Soviet consul general in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. He arranged for Russian advisers to help the Popular Front government while expanding the influence of the Soviet Union in the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe disappeared in 1938. It is believed that Stalin was convinced that Antonov-Ovseenko was plotting against him and in August 1937 he recalled him to the Soviet Union, where he was arrested and shot without trial in 1939.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From Spartacus Schoolnet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../a.htm\">Index of the Letter A</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

He refused to go, being opposed to war and was imprisoned for two years in Wakefield as a conscientious objector.

In 1919 the miners demanded higher wages, shorter hours and nationalisation of the mines. The government established a Committee of Enquiry and the Miners&#8217; Federation asked the LRD for help. Arnot assembled evidence on their behalf and publicised the miners&#8217; cause. Arnot, together with H. H. Slesser, the Federation legal advisor, drafted the Mines Nationalisation Bill which was presented to the Royal Commission set up by the government.

        "content": "\nEdward Bibbens Aveling was a prominent English biology instructor and popular spokesman for Darwinian evolution and atheism. He later met and moved in with Eleanor Marx, the youngest daughter of Karl Marx and became a socialist activist. Aveling was the author of numerous books and pamphlets and was a founding member of the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-league\">Socialist League</a> and the <a href=\"../../orgs/i/n.htm#ilp\">Independent Labour Party</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edward Aveling was born on 29 November 1849 in Stoke Newington, the fifth of eight children of Rev. Thomas William Baxter Aveling (1815&#8211;1884), a Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Mary Ann (d. 1877), daughter of Thomas Goodall, farmer and innkeeper, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.</p>\n\n<p>Aveling attended Harrow School, and in 1867 began to study medicine at University College London. He graduated with a BSc degree in Zoology in 1870. Aveling began teaching biology and lecturing in science at King's College London but was unable to advance due to his atheism and avowed leftist views. He subsequently on Anatomy and Biology at the London Hospital until 1882.</p>\n\n<p>Aveling married the heiress Isabel Campbell Frank on 30 July 1872, but the marriage only lasted two years. The pair separated amicably. According to Aveling, the cause of the split was his wife's inability to abide by his atheist views, although wags whispered that Aveling had married her for her money.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Political career</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1884, Aveling became the partner of Eleanor \"Tussy\" Marx, the daughter of Karl Marx, despite being the estranged husband of Isabel Frank, a status which remained until her death in 1892. Although his background was in biology rather than political economy, Aveling was thrust into the inner circle of British socialism through his personal relationship with Tussy.</p>\n\n<p>Later in 1884, Aveling and Marx were both elected to the Executive Council of the Social Democratic Federation. This position proved temporary, because the couple separated from the SDF at the end of the year along with William Morris and Belfort Bax in the acrimonious split which formed the Socialist League.</p>\n\n<p>In 1884, Frederick Engels enlisted Aveling to help in the translation of first volume of Karl Marx's Kapital. Aveling also achieved some small success as a playwright under the pen-name Alec Nelson. </p>\n\n<p>In the autumn of 1886, Aveling and Marx toured and lectured the United States on behalf of the Socialist Labor Party. Upon their return, they wrote a book detailing the situation of the left-wing political movement and trade unions in the US for a British audience. They found the US populated by \"unconscious socialists\", people who shared socialist values but disclaimed socialist ideas. Aveling and Marx wrote:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The mass of American Workers had scarcely any more conception of the meaning of Socialism than had 'their betters.' They also had been grievously misled by capitalist papers and capitalist economists and preachers. Hence it came to pass that after most of our meetings we were met by Knights of Labour, Central Labour Union men, and members of other working-class organisations, who told us that they, entering the place antagonists to Socialism as they fancied, had discovered that for a long time pas they had been holding its ideas.</p>\n\n<p>During his time in the Socialist League Aveling wrote and translated various socialist texts but nonetheless remained personally unpopular in the movement, the object of a steady steam of gossip and accusations.</p>\n\n<p>In August 1888, the branch to which Aveling and Marx belonged separated from the anarchist-dominated Socialist League in favor of an independent existence as the Bloomsbury Socialist Society.</p>\n\n<p>After leaving the Socialist League, Aveling became active in the Gasworkers' Union, for whom he served as an auditor.</p>\n\n<p>Aveling was a founding member and was elected to the Executive Committee of the Independent Labour Party by the 1893 Conference which established the organisation. He left that group to rejoin the Marxist Social Democratic Federation in 1896, despite his long-standing personal and political quarrel with SDF leader Henry Hyndman.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Later life, death, and legacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1897 Aveling left Eleanor and on 8 June that year secretly married an actress, Eva Frye, but returned to Eleanor when he was struck down with kidney disease. After nursing him for some time, Eleanor committed suicide mainly due to his infidelity. Aveling died four months later, on 2 August 1898, in Battersea of kidney disease. His body was cremated in Woking, Surrey, three days later.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his prominence as a member of the fledgling British Marxist movement, no representatives of the Socialist or Labour movements were present at the funeral due to the widely-held belief that he was responsible for Eleanor Marx's suicide.</p>\n\n<p>Aveling was also disliked by many of his contemporaries for his tendency to borrow money from everyone. A biographer of his wife wrote in 1976:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">The truth is that in moral terms Aveling presented something akin to an optical illusion: looked at in one light, he could be seen as feckless, happy-go-lucky but fundamentally sound; in another, as an unmitigated scoundrel. What, however, could not escape notice from any angle was his infinite propensity to borrow money, which age could not wither nor &#8212; more surprisingly &#8212; custom stale. He might be cheated...so that resigning from the Secular Society he was loaded with debt. Yet this hardly accounts for his habit of borrowing from the rich, the poor and the positively indigent for trifling amounts &#8212; though sometimes cleaning them out &#8212; since he never at any time &#8212; and this in an age of ostentatious spenders... &#8212; lived in a style above that of any other middl-class socialist who had neither business interests nor inherited wealth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\"> It is not uncommon to come across individuals from whose company and a small sum of money one simultaneously parts. This compulsion to borrow is not easy to explain in those who are neither on their beam ends nor aspire to high living.\" </p>\n\n<p>Although he had numerous relationships with women, Edward Aveling is not known to have fathered any children.</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst\">For more on his political activities see the biography on <a href=\"../m/a.htm#marx-eleanor\">Eleanor Marx</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See also <a href=\"../../../archive/aveling/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Edward Aveling Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../a.htm\">Index of the Letter A</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

For most of his life, Queen Elizabeth I was Queen of England, a period of expansion of British trade and influence. Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe in 1580, when Bacon was 19. The Italian Giordano Bruno, had further developed the Copernican system of the heavens (which replaced the Earth as the centre of the Universe with a heliocontric system), proposing an infinity of worlds and removing the Sun from the centre of the Universe. In 1600, when Bacon was 39, Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Roman Inquisition for his heresy. Shortly before Bacon's death Charles I ascended the throne. </p>\n<p>\nBacon's <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/bacon/1626/new-atlantis/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">New Atlantis</span></a>, written in 1617, foresaw a utopia in which people flourished on the basis of rational learning and advanced technology. New Atlantis was no &quot;classless society&quot; but a bourgeois republic. In 1640, Oliver Cromwell lead the English Revolution, for the first time in history beheading the King and replacing the monarchy with a bourgeois republic. </p>\n<p>\nBacon was a contemporary of Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) though Galileo's principal work, <span class=\"book\">Dialogo dei due sistemi dei mondo</span>, was not completed until after Bacon's death. Galileo was forced to recant.</p>\n<p>\nIn Bacon's time, there could not be said to exist anything which could be called natural science. What we have today began with the work of Galileo and Bacon. In Bacon's time, it would have been impossible for someone with a scientific disposition to distinguish between fact and fiction - religious dogma, travellers' yarns, superstition, the untested and unsubstantiated wisdom of the ancients, the practice of farmers and artisans handed down from father to son and mother to daughter. Only mathematics and, thanks to Galileo, the infant science of mechanics, could lay any claim to demonstrable verity. </p>\n<p>\nThe advantage Bacon had over his fellow-philosophers on the Continent, was that while war and the inquisition ravaged Europe, England was relatively (relatively!) united, prosperous and liberal and it was possible for Bacon to write as he did without winding up on the rack or the stake. In fact, Bacon had at one time spent 4 days in the Tower of London, not for his radical views, but for accepting bribes in his job as Lord Chancellor!</p>\n<p>\nSee <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/bacon/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Francis Bacon Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n"

He is important as the first source through which many of the Marxist and materialist ideas of history were disseminated through the English speaking world. Marx noted his efforts with approval in a letter to Sorge. He studied music at the Stuttgart Conservatoire (his nephew was Arnold Bax the composer) and he had been a music critic with Bernard Shaw, whom he knew well and is named as a philosopher by Shaw in the prologue to <em>Major Barbara</em>. He took part in the foundation of the Social Democratic Federation and collaborated in its organ, <em><a href=\"../../../history/international/social-democracy/justice.htm\" target=\"_top\">Justice</a>,</em> and in the monthly, <em>To-Day,</em> which he first tried to run independently but, owing to lack of funds, had to make over to <a href=\"../h/y.htm#hyndman-henry\">Hyndman</a> in 1884. He broke with Hyndman at the end of 1884 and together with Morris and <a href=\"../m/a.htm#eleanor-marx\">Eleanor Marx-Aveling</a>, etc, helped to form the Socialist League, which, however, later fell under anarchist influence. He went back to the SDF in 1889 and stayed with Hyndman thereafter. After the death of Morris his increasingly eccentric views about feminism came to the fore though he had a high opinion of &#8220;Fraulein Luxemburg&#8221; as appears in a polemic with Bernstein in <em>Justice</em> in 1896 on the Colonial question where he had an excellent position. Finally, during the First World War he went over to chauvinist positions seeing the main threat to his rather romanticised Republican France in the anti-democratic and aristocratic Junkers of Germany. He mourned Karl Liebknecht and denounced Noske and Scheidmann as reactionaries in his autobiography (1918) and his <a href=\"../../../archive/bax/bio/biography.htm\" target=\"_top\">memorial biography</a> was written by &#8220;Robert Arch&#8221; Archibald Harold Mann Robertson, a member of Hyndman&#8217;s surviving but tiny rump organisation.</p>\n<p>He married twice and had seven children by his first wife, none by his second.

Joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks\">Bolsheviks</a> with Bogdanov and A V Lunacharsky 1904, active in St Petersburg in 1905 revolution. Wrote in legal and clandestine social-democratic and Bolshevik press. From 1904 developed empiriocritical philosophy with Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, A M Gor'ky (Peshkov) and others. Criticism by V I Lenin in 1908 marked end of Bazarov&#8217;s connection with Lenin, but not with Bolshevik faction. Translated Marx&#8217;s <em>Kapital</em> with I I Skvortsov-Stepanov (3 volumes published 1907-1909, still regarded as standard Russian translation).</p>\n<p>Internationalist during WW1, Bazarov contributed to Gor'ky&#8217;s journal <em>Letopis&#8217; </em>1915-1917. Involved with Petrograd Soviet and its paper <em>Izvestiya</em> from the outset, he attended first meetings of St Petersburg Bolshevik committee after February 1917, then finally broke with Bolshevism. Closely associated with Gor'ky, N N Sukhanov (Gimmer), B V Avilov (Tigrov) on social-democratic newspaper <em>Novaya zhizn&#8217; </em>April 1917-July 1918. Its position was close to Yu O Martov and the Menshevik-Internationalists, and advocated overcoming divisions in Russian social-democracy on common internationalist platform.

        "content": "\r\nMary Ritter Beard was born in Indianapolis on 5 August 1876, the third of six children and the elder of two daughters of Narcissa (Lockwood) and Eli Foster Ritter. At sixteen she left home to attend De Pauw University in Asbury, Indiana, where she studied political science, languages, and literature. She graduated in 1897 and taught high school German until 1900 when she married Charles Austin Beard, whom she had met at De Pauw. Mary Beard accompanied her husband to Oxford, and both were active politically as well as academically. Charles helped organize Ruskin Hall, the \"free university\" aimed at workingmen, and Mary became involved with the British women&#8217;s suffrage movement. They returned to New York in 1902. Their daughter Miriam was born in 1903. The following year the Beards enrolled at Columbia University, but Mary quit soon after to take care of their child and volunteer for progressive causes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing the birth of her son William in 1907, Mary Beard became an organizer for the National Women&#8217;s Trade Union League. From 1910 to 1912 she edited the suffragist periodical <i>The Woman Voter</i>, and after that worked with the Wage Earner&#8217;s League. She was a member of the militant faction of the suffrage movement led by Alice Paul from 1913 to 1919, and she worked on several progressive causes. During this period, Charles taught at Columbia University, but he resigned in 1917 in protest of the firing of anti-war faculty. Charles helped establish the New School for Social Research (later joined by refugees from the Franfurt School) and both Beards helped found the Workers Education Bureau, but by the early 1920, the Beards generally worked outside of academic institutions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing her resignation from the National Woman&#8217;s Party in 1917, Mary Beard devoted her skills and efforts to writing and lecturing, rather than public political activity. Her first book, <i>Woman&#8217;s Work in Municipalities</i> (1915) and her second, A <i>Short History of the American Labor Movement</i> (1920), focused on social reform and the working class. With Charles, she co-authored <i>The Rise of American Civilization</i> (1927), a groundbreaking text that integrated political, economic, social, and cultural histories with a progressive vision of America&#8217;s past and distinctive national character. The two collaborated on several books that would become some of the most enduringly significant American history texts, but by herself, Mary pioneered the field of women&#8217;s history. She was appalled by the omission of women from the historical record, and she wrote about and promoted the recognition of women&#8217;s achievements in the present day and the past, in the U.S. and internationally. She authored and edited <i>Understanding Women</i> (1931), <i>America Through Women&#8217;s Eyes</i> (1933), <i>A Changing Political Economy as It Affects Women</i> (1934), and <i>Women as Force in History</i> (1946), among others.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRather than concentrating on grievances and questions of the subjugation of women, Beard&#8217;s work promoted women&#8217;s contributions to the formation of society and brought to light a long-neglected past. To this end in the early 1930s, she collaborated with Hungarian pacifist feminist Rosika Schwimmer to organize the World Center for Women&#8217;s Archives (WCWA). Beard quoted French historian Fustel de Coulanges for the motto of the WCWA: \"No documents, no history,\" and she envisioned an archive of women&#8217;s papers and organizational records that would provide a foundation for women&#8217;s history as an academic field as well as serve as a public good. Beard and Schwimmer raised funds, founded a board of directors, and collected documents from their network of women activists. The WCWA was headquartered in New York but collected on an international level. It was a well-publicized effort, and though the collection specialized in material from the pacifist movement, Beard worked to realize a broader conception for a collection representing the range of women&#8217;s activities. Factionalism among WCWA supporters, shaky financial support, and an increasingly militaristic atmosphere in the U.S. and abroad forced the dissolution of the WCWA in the early 1940s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis development was very discouraging to Beard, but fortunately, the WCWA generated momentum for developing institutions of women&#8217;s history. Beard worked closely with Smith College archivist Margaret Grierson to create the Sophia Smith Collection, one of the world&#8217;s largest women&#8217;s history manuscript collections, founded in 1942, and she worked with Harvard historians to create the eventual Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. These two institutions received many of the WCWA documents, as did several smaller collections. Together, they carried on the WCWA mission, at least partly due to Beard&#8217;s influence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNeither of the Beards avoided controversy in their writings or public stands. Though both were well-respected historians, they increasingly drew criticism for their pacifist and progressive politics in the years surrounding World War II. Charles Beard died in 1948, and Mary Ritter Beard died on 14 August 1958. Both Beards have had enduring reputations as incisive historians, and they are recognized for their pioneering work in social history. Mary Beard especially has been celebrated for her work to promote women&#8217;s history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/beard/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Mary Beard Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Becker&#8217;s work, which often made use of the muted tones of graphite or charcoal, was likewise generally softer in political tone than the more hard-edged and biting work of his peers, who included Art Young, Fred Ellis, Robert Minor, Hugo Gellert, and William Gropper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1921 to 1923, Becker lived in Mexico, where he worked as an artist for El Pulsa de México, an English-language magazine.

Foster for President of the United States. In 1936 he likewise endorsed Communist candidate Earl Browder as a member of the Committee of Professional Groups for Browder and Ford. His name appeared on the letterhead of the Artists&#8217; Front to Win the War, a mass organization closely linked to the Communist Party, and he was a signatory to the call for formation of the American Artists&#8217; Congress, a party-backed initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maurice Becker died in 1975.</p>\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

He organized fellow journeymen barbers into a union during his European years. In 1905 he joined the Swiss Social Democratic Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bedacht emigrated to the United States in 1908 and joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#spa\">Socialist Party of America</a> (SPA) during that same year.. In June of 1913 he moved to San Francisco to become the editor of the German-language labor newspaper <em>Vorwärts</em> der Pacific Küste (Forward of the Pacific Coast), a job which he retained until the paper&#8217;s termination in 1917 due to draconian postal regulations being placed on the foreign language press during World War I. He briefly moved to South Dakota to edit a paper called <em>The New Era</em> following the demise of the Vorwärts, but soon returned to San Francisco when he found that publication unviable, taking up the barbers&#8217; shears again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bedacht was long an adherent of the so-called impossibilist wing of the Socialist Party, placing his faith in socialist revolution rather than the ameliorative reform of elected officials.

Fraina and the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party which emerged in conjunction with that document.

From the ILP he joined the Marxist <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#sdf\">Social Democratic Federation</a>.

His half-hearted pursuit of an academic career was cut short when the University of Frankfurt rejected his brilliant but unconventional doctoral thesis, <span class=\"book\">The Origin of German Tragic Drama</span> (1928). Benjamin eventually settled in Paris after leaving Germany in 1933 after Hitler came to power. He continued to write essays and reviews for literary journals, but when Paris fell to the Nazis in 1940 he fled south with the hope of escaping to the US via Spain. Informed by the chief of police at the Franco-Spanish border that he would be turned over to the Gestapo, Benjamin committed suicide. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe posthumous publication of Benjamin&#8217;s prolific output won him a growing reputation in the later 20th century. The essays containing his philosophical reflections on literature are written in a dense and concentrated style that contains a strong poetic strain. He mixes social criticism and linguistic analysis with historical nostalgia while communicating an underlying sense of pathos and pessimism. The metaphysical quality of his early critical thought gave way to a Marxist inclination in the 1930s. Benjamin&#8217;s pronounced intellectual independence and originality are evident in the extended essay <span class=\"book\">Goethe&#8217;s Elective Affinities</span> and the essays collected in <span class=\"book\">Illuminations</span>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe approach to art of the USSR under <a href=\"../../people/s/t.htm#stalin-josef\" target=\"_top\">Stalin</a> was typified, first, by the persecution of all those who expressed any independent thought, and, second, by the adoption of Socialist Realism - the view that art is dedicated to the &quot;realistic&quot; representation of - simplistic, optimistic - &quot;proletarian values&quot; and proletarian life. Subsequent Marxist thinking about art has been largely influenced by Walter Benjamin and <a href=\"../../people/l/u.htm#lukacs-georg\">Georg Luk&aacute;cs</a> however. Both were exponents of Marxist humanism who saw the important contribution of Marxist theory to aesthetics in the analysis of the condition of labour and in the critique of the alienated and &quot;reified&quot; consciousness of man under capitalism. Benjamin&#8217;s collection of essays <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</a></span> (1936) attempts to describe the changed experience of art in the modern world and sees the rise of Fascism and mass society as the culmination of a process of debasement, whereby art ceases to be a means of instruction and becomes instead a mere gratification, a matter of taste alone. &quot;Communism responds by politicising art&quot; - that is, by making art into the instrument by which the false consciousness of the mass man is to be overthrown. </p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/benjamin/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Walter Benjamin Archive</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The first Socialist elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, in 1919 he was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti-militarist views and as a result was twice denied the seat to which he had been elected in the House of Representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born to a Jewish family in Nieder Rehbach, Austria-Hungary (now in Romania) on February 28, 1860, Victor L. Berger attended the Gymnasium at Leutschau (today in Slovakia) and the universities at Budapest and Vienna. He emigrated to the United States in 1878 with his parents, settling near Bridgeport, Connecticut. From there he moved to Woodstock, Illinois in 1880, and then to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1881, where he was a schoolteacher and newspaper editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger was credited by trade union leader Eugene V. Debs for having won him over to the cause of socialism. Jailed for six months for violating a federal anti-strike injunction in the 1894 strike of the American Railway Union, Debs turned to reading:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\"Books and pamphlets and letters from socialists came by every mail and I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be shattered and battered and splintered on a single stroke....</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It was at this time, when the first glimmerings of socialism were beginning to penetrate, that Victor L. Berger &#8212; and I have loved him ever since &#8212; came to Woodstock [jail], as if a providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of socialism I had ever heard &#8212; the very first to set the wires humming in my system. As a souvenir of that visit there is in my library a volume of Capital by Karl Marx, inscribed with the compliments of Victor L. Berger, which I cherish as a token of priceless value.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1896 Berger was a delegate to the People&#8217;s Party Convention in St. Louis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1897 he married a former student, Meta Schlichting. The couple raised two daughters, Doris and Elsa, who at first spoke only German in the home, indicative of their parents' cultural orientation. Berger was short and stocky, with a studious demeanor, and had both a self-deprecating sense of humor and a volatile temper. Although loyal to friends, he was strongly opinionated and intolerant of dissenting views. His ideological sparring partner and comrade Morris Hillquit later recalled of Berger that</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"He was sublimely egotistical, but somehow his egotism did not smack of conceit and was not offensive. It was the expression of deep and naive faith in himself, and this unshakable faith was one of the mainsprings of his power over men.\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America in 1897 and led the split of the \"political action\" faction of that organization to form the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) in 1898. He was a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the SDP for its entire duration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger was a founder of the Socialist Party of America in 1901 and played a critical role in the negotiations with an east coast dissident faction of the Socialist Labor Party in the establishment of this new political party. Berger was regarded as one of the party's leading revisionist Marxists, an advocate of the trade union-oriented and incremental politics of Edward Bernstein. He advocated the use of electoral politics to implement reforms and thus gradually build a collectivist society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger was a man of the written word and back room negotiation, not a notable public speaker. He retained a heavy German accent and had a voice which did not project well. As a rule he did not accept outdoor speaking engagements and was a poor campaigner, preferring one-on-one relationships to mass oratory.Berger was, however, a newspaper editorialist par excellence. Throughout his life he published and edited a number of different papers, including the German language Vorwärts (\"Forward\") (1892-1911), the Social-Democratic Herald (1901-1913), and the Milwaukee Leader (1911-1929). His papers were tied to the socialist movement and organized labor through the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First term in Congress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger ran for Congress and lost in 1904 before winning Wisconsin's 5th congressional district seat in 1910 as the first Socialist to serve in the United States Congress. In Congress, he focused on issues related to the District of Columbia and also more radical proposals, including eliminating the President's veto, abolishing the Senate, and the social takeover of major industries. Berger gained national publicity for his old-age pension bill, the first of its kind introduced into Congress. Although he did not win re-election in 1912, 1914 or 1916, he remained active in Wisconsin and Socialist Party politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger was very active in the biggest party controversy of the pre-war years, the fight between the SP's center-right \"regular\" bloc against the syndicalist left wing over the issue of \"sabotage.\" The bitter battle erupted in full force at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Berger was again a delegate. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of \"any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation.\" The debate was vitriolic, with Berger, somewhat unsurprisingly, stating the matter in its most bellicose form:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Comrades, the trouble with our party is that we have men in our councils who claim to be in favor of political action when they are not. We have a number of men who use our political organization &#8212; our Socialist Party &#8212; as a cloak for what they call direct action, for IWW-ism, sabotage and syndicalism. It is anarchism by a new name....<br />\r\n    Comrades, I have gone through a number of splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past. In the past we often had to fight utopianism and fanaticism. Now it is anarchism again that is eating away at the vitals of our party.<br />\r\n    If there is to be a parting of the ways, if there is to be a split &#8212; and it seems that you will have it, and must have it &#8212; then, I am ready to split right here. I am ready to go back to Milwaukee and appeal to the Socialists all over the country to cut this cancer out of our organization.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulars won the day handily at the Indianapolis convention of 1912, with a successful recall of IWW leader \"Big Bill\" Haywood from the SP's National Executive Committee and an exodus of disaffected left wingers following shortly thereafter. The remaining radicals in the party remembered bitterly Berger's role in this affair and the ill feelings continued to fester until erupting anew at the end of the decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Berger and World War I</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger's views on World War I were complicated by the Socialist view and the difficulties surrounding his German heritage. However, he did support his party's stance against the war. When the United States entered the war and passed the Espionage Act in 1917, Berger's continued opposition made him a target. He and four other Socialists were indicted under the Espionage Act in February 1918; the trial followed on December 9 of that year, and on February 20, 1919, Berger was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. The trial was presided over by Judge Kenesaw Landis, who later became the first commissioner of Major League Baseball. His conviction was appealed, and ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court on January 31, 1921, which found that Judge Landis had improperly presided over the case after the filing of an affidavit of prejudice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of his being under indictment at the time, the voters of Milwaukee elected Berger to the House of Representatives in 1918. When he arrived in Washington to claim his seat, Congress formed a special committee to determine whether a convicted felon and war opponent should be seated as a member of Congress. On November 10, 1919 they concluded that he should not, and declared the seat vacant. Wisconsin promptly held a special election to fill the vacant seat, and on December 19, 1919, elected Berger a second time. On January 10, 1920, the House again refused to seat him, and the seat remained vacant until 1921, when Republican William H. Stafford claimed the seat after defeating Berger in the 1920 general election.\r\nSecond stint in Congress</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berger defeated Stafford in 1922 and was reelected in 1924 and 1926. In those terms, he dealt with Constitutional changes, a proposed old-age pension, unemployment insurance, and public housing. He also supported the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. After his defeat by Stafford in 1928, he returned to Milwaukee and resumed his career as a newspaper editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 16, 1929 Berger was struck by a streetcar at the corner of 3rd and Clarke Streets in Milwaukee. The accident fractured his skull, and he died of his injuries on August 7, 1929. Prior to burial at Forest Home Cemetery his body lay in state at City Hall and was viewed by 75,000 citizens of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Writings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victor Berger's journalism was voluminous, but rarely reproduced in book or pamphlet form. A massive number of editorials were produced for the pages of the paper he edited, the Milwaukee Leader. In addition, two books collecting Berger's writings were published, Berger's Broadsides (1912), and Voice and Pen of Victor L. Berger: Congressional Speeches and Editorials (1929). Victor Berger's papers are housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society, as is the complete run of the Milwaukee Leader on microfilm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/berger-victor/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Victor Berger Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n"

He joined the Linkspartei (Left Party) upon its formation in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Bergmann taught agricultural studies at various universities until his retirement in 1981. He was a prolific author, writing 50 books and a large number of articles on agriculture and other topics, most notably on the history of the left in Germany. His last book was an historical account of the Bergmann family, published in 2014.

That neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas forms by the imagination exist without mind is what everybody will allow ... and to me it seems no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the senses, however blended or combined together cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them&#8221;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\n&#8220;It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing among men that houses, mountains, rivers and in a word, all sensible objects, have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the understanding ... For what are the aforementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? And what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? And is it plainly repugnant that anyone of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived&#8221;. [from <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/berkeley.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Of the Principles of Human Understanding</span></a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn other words, he said to the empiricists: &#8216;You know that sensations exist, but you know not of anything beyond; sensation are acting only upon senses&#8217;. Berkeley <em>proved</em> that empiricism leads to subjective idealism. In order to explain the existence of knowledge at all, Berkeley invented a special new sense which is able to sense &#8220;notions,&#8221; thus leading back to religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBerkeley&#8217;s subjective idealist attack on materialism, purporting to show that the assertion that something exists outside the mind of the individual human being is absurd, useless and unprovable, was in fact a great service to the development of materialism. This can be said because Berkeley drew to its &#8220;logical conclusion&#8221; the development of empiricism. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"../../people/b/a.htm#bacon-francis\">Bacon</a> asserted, as a materialist, that we had to use our eyes, ears and hands and go <em>out</em> to <em>Nature</em> to discover truth. Hobbes and Locke developed Bacon&#8217;s &#8220;empiricism&#8221; in the narrow sense, by reducing the investigation of Nature to experience to sense perception, equating sense perception with ideas, and ultimately equating the rational faculty as a whole with the action of the external world on the senses, with sense perception. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBerkeley shows that this line of development leads to knowledge only of phenomena, in the form of sensations, not the essence of things existing outside of and independently of our perception of us. Perception has become, not people&#8217;s <em>connection</em> with Nature, but a <em>barrier</em> sealing us off from Nature absolutely. The <em>logical conclusion</em> of empiricism is <em>subjective idealism</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBerkeley avoids outright &quot;solipsism&quot; by adding to his thesis, that the God can perceive sensations independently of us, thus allowing &quot;things&quot; to exist while we are not actually looking at them. This unconvincing objective idealist &quot;correction&quot; to his otherwise consistent subjective idealism grew more significant in the course of his development. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, Berkeley&#8217;s insane conclusions are generally accepted as the last word on the question of matter for the French, British and American traditions of idealist philosophy for a long time afterwards. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to develop further, <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism\">materialism</a> had to find an answer to Berkeley&#8217;s challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n"

As Singh and his organization rose to new prominence in the Indian independence movement, they became the focus of public criticism from Ghandi himself, who disagreed with their belief that violence was a necessary and vital component of revolutionary struggle.</p>\n<p>\nSingh&#8217;s secularism was perhaps his most important contribution to the socialist and independence struggles. During those turbulent times, British Imperialism used every tactic to create antagonism among the different religions of India, especially between Hindus and Muslims. The Sanghatan and Shuddi Movements among Hindus; and tableegh and many sectarian movements in Muslims bear witness to the effects of this tactic.  Bhagat Singh removed his beard which was a violation of Sikh religion, because he did not want to create before the public the image of a &#8216;Sikh&#8217; freedom fighter. Nor did he want to be held up as a hero by the followers of this religion. He wanted to teach the people that British Imperialism was their common enemy and they must be united against it to win freedom.</p>\n<p>\nOn April 8, 1924, Baghat Singh and his compatriot B. K. Dutt hurled two bombs on to the floor of the Central Delhi Hall in New Delhi. The bombs were tossed away from individuals so as not to harm anyone and, in fact, no one was harmed in the ensuing explosions.  Following the explosions, Singh and Dutt showered the hall with copies of a leaflet that later was to be known as &#8220;<a href=\"../../../archive/bhagat-singh/1929/04/08.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Red Pamphlet</a>.&#8221;  The pamphlet began with a passage which was to become legendary in the Indian revolutionary struggle:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\n &#8220;It takes a loud voice to make the deaf hear, with these immortal words uttered on a similar occasion by <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/goldman/works/1917/political-violence.htm#vaillant\" target=\"_top\">Vaillant</a>, a French anarchist martyr, do we strongly justify this action of ours.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>\nSingh and Dutt concluded the pamphlet with the phrase &#8220;Long Live the Revolution!&#8221; This phrase (translated from &#8220;Inquilab Zindabad!&#8221; became one of the most enduring slogans of the Indian Independence Movement.</p>\n<p>\nSingh and Dutt turned themselves in following the bombing incident. Following the trial, they were sentenced to &#8220;transportation for life&#8221; and while imprisoned, Singh and Dutt became outspoken critics of the Indian penal system, embarking on hunger strikes and engaging in agitation and propaganda from within the confines of the prison. Shortly after the commencement of his prison sentence, Singh was implicated in the 1928 death of a Deputy Police Superintendent. Singh acknowledged involvement in the death and he was executed by hanging on 23 March 1931.</p>\n<p>\nBhagat Singh is widely hailed as a martyr as a result of his execution at the hands of oppressors and, as such, he is often  referred to as &#8220;Shaheed (Martyr) Bhagat Singh.&#8221;  </p>\n\n<p class=\"inline\">Mike Bessler, 2006</p>\n\n<p><em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/bhagat-singh/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Bhagat Singh Archive</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../b.htm\">Index of the Letter B</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>English poet, painter, printmaker, and radical, who lived during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A pioneer British poet in the Romantic tradition and known for his radical views and radical politics during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Alongside others, Blake is considered a key forerunner to modern left-wing ideas which emerged after the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution of 1789. </p>\n<p>William Blake, was an English/British printmaker and poet who contributed both in the arts and to British radical politics during the 1700s and early 1800s. Mostly ignored and forgotten in his own times, Blake was a key figure in the Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century and an important figure in British literary history and radical history. An artisan printmaker for the majority of his life, Blake produced both excellent paintings, prints and print works, alongside some of the finest Romantic poetry written in English. Alongside this Blake was a political radical for his times, being a democrat, a republican, a supporter of the American Revolution and the French Revolution, a free thinker, a critic of industrial capitalism, a fierce opponent of slavery, empire and imperialism, a champion of free love and women&#8217;s rights, and committed to a proto form of Anarchism and of Socialism. In political terms Blake was influenced by the radical tradition of English religion, dating back to the radical wing of the English Revolution of 1640. Blake was a left-wing radical and is still respected today within the British Left and the British Radical movement. For his poetic and artistic work, Blake is still revered as one of the best figures produced by the Romantic tradition in British literary history. His poetry is known for integrating religious themes with social criticism, alongside romantic impulses. </p>\n<p>Blake was born on 28 November 1757, in Soho, London, United Kingdom, into an artisanal family who worked in hosiery. After a short education, leaving school at age 10, Blake became an apprentice engraver at the age of 14, before becoming a professional engraver at the age of 21.  </p> \n<p>Blake was primarily self-taught but learned the art of painting from taking courses at the Royal Academy of Arts, from 1779. Most of Blake&#8217;s professional life was spent as an artisan and as an engraver. </p> \n<p>He also self-published his poetry, most particularly a collection of poems, &#8216;Songs of Innocence&#8217; and &#8216;Songs of Experience&#8217;, in 1789 and 1794. </p>\n<p>Blake&#8217;s poetical works include: &#8216;Songs of Innocence&#8217;, &#8216;Songs of Experience&#8217;, &#8216;America a Prophecy&#8217;, &#8216;Europe a Prophecy&#8217;, &#8216;The Song of Los&#8217;, &#8216;The Book of Los&#8217;, &#8216;Milton&#8217;, &#8216;Preface to Milton&#8217;, and &#8216;Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion&#8217;.</p>\n<p>  William Blake died in August 1827. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, London, a graveyard typically holding religious non-conformists, dissenters and other radicals. He was married to Catherine Blake (née Boucher) from 1782 - 1827, ending with his death. Blake today is remembered primarily as a painter, a poet, printmaker and radical.   \n<p class=\"fst\">See also: </p>\n<p class=\"indentb\"> <a href=\"../../../subject/mayday/poetry/blake.html\">The Chimney Sweeper</a> by Wm.

        "content": "\nFrench politician and historian. A socialist that favored reforms, he called for the creation of procedure cooperatives in order to guarantee employment for the city poor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>\n\n<p>He was born in Madrid, his father held the post of inspector-general of finance under Joseph Bonaparte. Failing to receive aid from Pozzo di Borgo, his mother's uncle, Louis Blanc studied law in Paris, living in povertyagi, and became a contributor to various journals. In the Revue du progres, which he founded, he published in 1839 his study on L'Organisation du travail. The principles laid down in this famous essay form the key to Louis Blanc's whole political career. He attributes all the evils that afflict society to the pressure of competition, whereby the weaker are driven to the wall. He demanded the equalization of wages, and the merging of personal interests in the common good-- \"à chacun selon ses besoins, de chacun selon ses facultés,\" which is often translated as \"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.\" This was to be affected by the establishment of \"social workshops,\" a sort of combined co-operative society and trade-union, where the workmen in each trade were to unite their efforts for their common benefit. In 1841 he published his Histoire de dix ans 1830-1840, an attack upon the monarchy of July. It ran through four editions in four years.</p>\n\n<p> <strong>The Revolution of 1848</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1847 he published the two first volumes of his Histoire de la Revolution Française. Its publication was interrupted by the Revolution of 1848, when Louis Blanc became a member of the provisional government. It was on his motion that, on 25 February, the government undertook \"to guarantee the existence of the workmen by work\"; and though his demand for the establishment of a ministry of labour was refused&#8212;as beyond the competence of a provisional government&#8212;he was appointed to preside over the government labour commission (Commission du Gouvernement pour les travailleurs) established at the Palace Luxembourg to inquire into and report on the labour question.</p>\n\n<p>The revolution of 1848 was the real chance for Louis Blanc&#8217;s ideas to be implemented. His theory of using the established government to enact change was different from those of other socialist theorists of his time. Blanc believed that workers could control their own livelihoods, but knew that unless they were given help to get started the cooperative workshops would never work. To assist this process along Blanc lobbied for national funding of these workshops until the workers could assume control. To fund this ambitious project, Blanc saw a ready revenue source in the rail system. Under government control the railway system would provide the bulk of the funding needed for this and other projects Blanc saw in the future.</p>\n\n<p> \nWhen the workshop program was ratified in the national assembly, Blanc&#8217;s chief rival Emile Thomas was put in control of the project. The national assembly was not ready for this type of social program and treated the workshops as a method of buying time until the assembly could gather enough support to stabilize themselves against another worker rebellion. Emile Thomas&#8217;s deliberate failure in organizing the workshops into a success only seemed to anger the public more. The people had been promised a job and a working environment in which the workers were in charge, from these government funded programs. What they had received was hand outs and government funded work parties to dig ditches and hard manual labor for meager wages or paid to remain idle. When the workshops were closed the workers rebelled again but were put down by force by the national guard. The national assembly was also able to blame Blanc for the failure of the workshops. His ideas were questioned and he lost much of the respect which had given him influence with the public.</p>\n\n<p>\nBetween the \"sans-culottes\", who tried to force him to place himself at their head, and the national guards, who mistreated him, he was nearly killed. Rescued with difficulty, he escaped with a false passport to Belgium, and then to London. In his absence he was condemned by a special tribunal at Bourges, in contumaciam, to deportation. Against trial and sentence he alike protested, developing his protest in a series of articles in the Nouveau Monde, a review published in Paris under his direction. These he afterwards collected and published as Pages de l'histoire de la révolution de 1848 (Brussels, 1850).</p>\n\n<p> <strong>Exile</strong></p>\n\n<p>During his stay in Britain he made use of the unique collection of materials for the revolutionary period preserved at the British Museum to complete his Histoire de la Revolution Française 12 vols. (1847-1862). In 1858 he published a reply to Lord Normanby's A Year of Revolution in Paris (1858), which he developed later into his Histoire de la révolution de 1848 (2 vols., 1870-1880). He was also active in the irregular masonic organisation, the Conseil Supreme de l&#8217;Ordre Maconnique de Memphis. His membership in the London-based La Grand Loge des Philadelphes is unconfirmed.</p>\n\n<p><strong> Return to France</strong></p>\n\n<p>As far back as 1839 Louis Blanc had vehemently opposed the idea of a Napoleonic restoration, predicting that it would be \"despotism without glory,\" \"the Empire without the Emperor.\" He therefore remained in exile until the fall of the Second Empire in September 1870, after which he returned to Paris and served as a private in the national guard. On 8 February 1871 he was elected a member of the National Assembly, in which he maintained that the republic was \"the necessary form of national sovereignty,\" and voted for the continuation of the war; yet, though a leftist, he did not sympathize with the Paris Commune, and exerted his influence in vain on the side of moderation. In 1878 he advocated the abolition of the presidency and the Senate. In January 1879 he introduced into the chamber a proposal for the amnesty of the Communards, which was carried. This was his last important act. His declining years were darkened by ill-health and by the death, in 1876, of his wife Christina Groh, whom he had married in 1865. He died at Cannes, and on 12 December received a state funeral in the Père Lachaise.</p>\n\n<p> <strong>His political legacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Louis Blanc possessed a picturesque and vivid style, and considerable power of research; but the fervour with which he expressed his convictions, while placing him in the first rank of orators, tended to turn his historical writings into political pamphlets. His political and social ideas have had a great influence on the development of socialism in France. His Discours politiques (1847-1881) was published in 1882. his most important works, besides those already mentioned, are Lettres sur l'Angleterre (1866-1867), Dix années de l'Histoire de l'Angleterre (1879-1881), and Questions d'aujourd'hui et de demain (1873-1884).</p>\n\n<p>V.I. Lenin, L.

        "content": "\nBill Bland was born in the North of England, into a middle class home. He spent his politically formative years in the army of New Zealand, where he was active in the Communist Party as an educator. He returned to Britain in the post-war years as an ophthalmic optician. In the 1950&#8217;s Bland witnessed the Communist Party of Great Britain embracing the  &#8220;Peaceful Road to Socialism\", and Khrushchev&#8217;s denunciation of Stalin. Bland believed these &#8220;revisionist&#8221; stances were incorrect and anti-Marxist-Leninist. </p>\n<p>\nBland therefore became  a member of several anti-revisionist formations in Britain. He soon joined forces with Mike Baker in the Marxist-Leninist Organisation of Britain (MLOB). Shortly thereafter, the &#8216;Cultural Revolution&#8217; occured in China, and prompted by a barrage of questions, Bland undertook a systematic study of Mao. He found that he could not agree with Mao&#8217;s theory of the &#8216;New Democratic State&#8217;; and penned within months, the first refutation of Mao from the point of view of a pro-Stalin supporter. At that time, the MLOB rapidly dwindled in size as many members retained affection of Mao. This was to be the first of Bland&#8217;s many un-popular analyses in the pro-Stalin wing of the Communist movement. </p>\n<p>\nBland spent the rest of his life trying to answer the question: &#8220;How had revisionism become ascendant?&#8221;</p>\n<p>\nBland came to the conclusion that <a href=\"../../people/s/t.htm#stalin-josef\">Stalin</a> had been in a minority position in the Politburo, surrounded by hidden revisionists too clever to openly attack Marxism-Leninism; further, they had straight-jacketed Stalin by means of erecting the &#8220;Cult of Personality,&#8221; which was then used as a weapon against him. Bland felt that Yezhov had subverted the secret services, who had been replaced at Stalin&#8217;s behest by Beria. Bland pointed for example, to the release of many thousands of wrongly imprisoned Bolsheviks. Bland then argued  that by the 18th Party Congress Stalin had been excluded from the highest echelons of the party decision making apparatus, and had counter-attacked with his pamphlet &#8220;Economic Problems of the USSR.&#8221;</p> \n<p>\nStalin&#8217;s essay was a seminal attack on Nikolai Vosnosensky, who was linked to <a href=\"../../people/k/h.htm#khrushchev-nikita\">Khrushchev</a>. Cosequently argued Bland, the later economic changes re-establishing capitalism in the USSR had been fought to a standstill by Stalin. Bland therefore argued a special significance for  Stalin&#8217;s last work. As Bland saw it,  once Stalin was dead, the capitalist &#8220;reforms&#8221; of Vosnosensky were enacted by Khrushchev and his successors. He formulated these views in articles that culminated in the book &#8216;Restoration of Capitalism in the USSR&#8217;, published in 1981. \n</p><p>\nFollwing his analysis of Maoism as &#8216;left revisionism&#8217;, Bland began to question his own long-standing support for the then pro-Chinese Party of Labour of Albania, but concluded that the People&#8217;s Socialist Republic of Albania remained socialist. Before the 20th party Congress of the CPSU, Bland had founded the Albanian Society of Britain, at the invitation of the PSRA.  Despite now being officially ostracized by Albania, Bland continued his work running the Albanian Society, and organizing an enormous education on this isolated solitary socialist country. In those years, he became an acknowledged authority on all things Albanian. He published an English-Albanian dictionary and he fielded any manner of queries upon arcane features of Albanian life, history, music, foods, geography, customs and mores etc. \n</p><p>\nWhile China was supported by the Albanian party, some of the Maoist parties had run an explicit party front Albania Society, resisting Bland&#8217;s call for one single, united front Albania Society, regardless of &#8216;narrow&#8217; party affiliation. Following <a href=\"../../people/h/o.htm#hoxha-enver\">Hoxha</a>&#8217;s open attack on Mao, some of these Societies split and some died. Their remaining members were correctly advised by the foreign Liaison committee of the PSRA, to join with Bland&#8217;s organisation to form one United Front of support for the PSRA. But they launched attempts to remove Bland&#8217;s leadership, charging that an emphasis on all aspects of life &#8211; such as music etc &#8211; was &#8220;anti-Marxist-Leninist,&#8221; and &#8220;insufficiently political,&#8221; and that Bland  should be removed. The membership rejected this attempt to remove Bland. The Society continued till the revisionist take-over of the PSRA by Ramiz Alia, at which point Bland resigned from the Albania Society. </p>\n<p>\nIt was primarily differences over Bland&#8217;s analysis of Albania as Socialist that precipitated the split in the MLOB in 1975, following which, the Communist League came into existence. The Communist League from its inception always supported the Peoples Socialist Republic of Albania as a solitary socialist state. Those that stayed with the MLOB, including Mike Baker and his supporters, rejected that position.</p>\n<p>\nOne specific aspect of modern revisionism, to which Bland paid close attention, was the subversion of the second stage of socialist revolution, into a static national democratic deviations. For Bland, this represented a distortion from the Marxist-Leninist theory of the nation. Into these categories, Bland placed the pseudo-&#8216;socialist&#8217; revolutions of China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and Tanzania. He argued that all of these had ignored Lenin&#8217;s injunction not to build a &#8216;Chinese Wall&#8217; between the first (national democratic) stage of revolution and the second (socialist) stage. Bland also argued that other, phenomena such as the &#8220;Black Nation&#8221; in the USA, &#8220;Black Racism&#8221; and &#8220;Scottish, Welsh and Cornish Nationalism\", in Britain, represented national deviations away from socialist revolution.</p>\n<p>\nThese views led him to challenge fundamental Stalinist premises: If the Soviet Union had been permeated by a class war involving the highest echelons of the Party, was the <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international\">Comintern</a> any different? </p>\n<p>\nBland puzzled over several related matters: Why had the Comintern performed so many about-turns on key questions such as the nature of the United Front? Was Stalin really &#8216;in control&#8217; of the Comintern? Why had the Peoples Front governments been supported beyond any credible point by European communist parties, especially in France, in assisting a fascist take-over? And why did the ultra-left rejections of a united front of the late 1920&#8217;s swing suddenly into ultra-right distortions of a correct United Front policy? Etc. </p>\n<p>\nBland argued that the first ultra-left deviations in the Comintern, in the period from about 1924 to 1928 had allowed fascism to take power in Germany. In the same period, under the cover of this ultra-leftism, Manuilsky and Kussinen had destroyed the Indian revolution by sabotaging Stalin&#8217;s line of the Workers and Peasants parties. Bland thought that the second right deviations, from about 1930 onwards had prevented the masses of Europe taking power under Communist Party direction. </p>\n<p>\nBland now further argued that Stalin had not been in a leadership position in the Comintern since around 1924; as follows: Initially <a href=\"../../people/z/i.htm#zinoviev\">Zinoviev</a> had exercised the leadership, and thereafter <a href=\"../../people/b/u.htm#bukharin-nikolai\">Bukharin</a>. When both were exposed as \"revisionists\" they were purged from further influencing the Comintern. Both were later shot. Thereafter <a href=\"../../people/d/i.htm#dimitrov-georgi\">Dimitrov</a>, Otto Kuusinen, and Dimitri Manuilskii exercised the Comintern leadership. Bland argued they had perverted a correct implementation of Marxism-Leninism. Dimitrov had been sprung from the German Fascist prisons thanks to a rather dubious, and surprising &#8220;leniency&#8221; of the German fascists. &#8220;Why?&#8221;, asked Bland, replying that a pact had been struck; as shown when Dimitrov went on to subvert United Front tactics into the right deviation of supporting &#8220;Popular Front&#8221; governments beyond Marxist-Leninist principles of the correct United Front tactics. </p>\n<p>\nIt was for these reasons, argued Bland, that the Comintern was dissolved by Stalin. Stalin then created the Cominform under a completely different leadership, led by his most trusted lieutenants such as Zhdanov. It must be remembered, said Bland, that it was the Cominform that had exposed the Western Communist parties plans for implementing right deviationist policies, and the Titoites for allying with the USA. During this latter historic confrontation Stalin overtly supported Albania and Hoxha against <a href=\"../../people/t/i.htm#tito-broz\">Tito</a>. </p>\n<p>\nApart from his theoretical works, Bland wrote a number of plays, directed two films, and created a ballet. A life-long intense love of the arts &#8211; especially cinema and the theatre &#8211; led him to re-affirm the principles of Socialist Realist Art. He wrote widely on theatre and film, and on the history of theatre. </p>\n<p>\nIn Britain he led the Communist League to urge the principled unity of all Marxist-Leninist forces, hence Bland&#8217;s role in the early stages of the National Committee for A Marxist-Leninist Unity (NCMLU). Bland also formed the Stalin Soicety in the UK. But the pro-China factions within the Stalin Society that ensured Bland&#8217;s later expulsion.  He was a key figure in the formation of the International Struggle Marxist-Leninist, and was cited as a major influence by <a href=\"https://ml-review.ca/aml/index.html\" target=\"_top\">Alliance Marxist-Leninist (North America)</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/bland/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Bill Bland Reference Archive</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">by Hari Kumar</p>\n\n\n"

Blanqui neither cared for economic nor social/historical theory, but dedicated his heart and mind to the theory and practice of workers' revolution. Blanqui recognized, as a result of extreme police persecution, that a successful workers revolution in 19th-century France could only be led by a small group of disciplined workers.\n</p>\n<p>         \nAt 13 years old, Blanqui had moved to Paris to live with his older brother, Adolphe.  In Paris Blanqui studied law and medicine until 1824; completing his education when he was 19 years old. Beginning in 1827, he took an active part in students demonstrations against the restored Bourbon monarchy, which he followed through to the Revolution of July 1830 (which had established to the monarchy of Louis-Philippe). Outraged by all the blood workers had spilled in the preceding years to see it commadered by an autocrat convinced Blanqui of the need for a workers revolution.\n</p>\n<p>\nA member of the Society of Friends of the People (Société des Amis du Peuple), Blanqui was first imprisoned in 1831, and again in 1836 as a result of his association with this illegal society. As these acts of extreme police persecution, workers movements could only exist as small, disciplined and secretive societies. Having clear vision, Blanqui (much like <a href=\"../../people/l/e.htm#lenin\">Lenin</a>) concluded that only extremely disciplined workers could achieve workers revolution in those conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\nBlanqui organized the Society of the Seasons (Soci&#233;t&#233; des Saisons) and attempted an armed instruction on May 12, 1839 against the H&#244;tel de Ville (the City Hall) of Paris. Isolated both physically and politically from Paris workers, the 500 armed revolutionaries were slaughtered in less than two days of fighting. Blanqui, who managed to escape the disaster, was caught and sentenced to death.  His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on the island of Mont-Saint-Michel.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis stay in the deplorable prison crushed him physically, and after four wrenching years of <em>solitary confinement</em>, he was granted clemency to be released to a prison hospital at Tours, from where he was released after five years of recovery, shortly before the Revolution of 1848.\n</p>\n<p>\nReturning to Paris, he created a new reformist society &#8211; the Central Republican Society (Société Républicaine Centrale), through which he attempted to reform the new provisional government to adopt policies in favor of the working class. The conservative government that was elected to the Constituent Assembly, had different plans however, and found in Blanqui a scapegoat for radical workers' demonstrations. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on the false charge of having participated in a demonstration which he in fact had disapproved of.\n</p>\n<p>\nReleased in 1859, he returned to organizing workers' parties and was arrested again in 1861, and held until he escaped to Belgium in 1865.  His all-too frequent stays in prison earned him the name <em>l'enferm&#233;</em> (the locked-up one). Blanqui did not return to Paris until the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 began.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter Napoleon III capitulated at the <a href=\"../../events/s/e.htm#sedan-battle\">Battle of Sedan</a>, and the siege of Paris began, Blanqui agitated against Prussian occupation of France, suggesting how Paris should best defend itself. On October 31, 1870, Blanqui lead revolutionaries to attempt to overthrow the government, and succeeded in capturing the H&#244;tel de Ville and set up a government with Blanqui at its head. Just a day later, however, the government stormed the Hotel and arrested Blanqui and many of other revolutionary leaders for treason. His remaining Paris followers again attempted to overthrow the government, on January 22, 1871, this time unarmed. Soldiers guarding the H&#244;tel de Ville open fire on the protesting workers, killing hundreds.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the beginning of the French <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Civil War of 1871 </a>, the <a href=\"../../orgs/p/a.htm#paris-commune\"> Paris Commune</a> was elected, and Blanqui was elected president. The government of <a href=\"../../people/t/h.htm#thiers-louis-adolphe\">Thiers</a> refused to release Blanqui, despite the legitimate election of him to public office. After tens of thousands of workers were massacred in Paris by government troops as a result of their struggle to establish the first workers government ever created, Blanqui was kept locked up in prison. In April 1879, he was elected deputy for Bordeaux; however the government refused to recognize the election. With great workers unrest, however, they weighed their options and decided that releasing the 74-year-old man would put out many more fires than it would start. Blanqui continued to agitate for Socialism, and died at nearly 76 years old from apoplexy.\n</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/blanqui/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Louis Auguste Blanqui Archive</a>.</p>\n\n"

She was married first to Lucien Ware, then Louis Cohen, and finally Andrew Omholt. After marrying Lucian Ware when she was nineteen, she was a mother of four by 1892. Her daughter, Helen Ware, was a concert violinist while son, Harold Ware, became an agriculture expert as an activist in the Communist Party of America. One of her other sons was Buzz Ware, an artist and prominent leader in the Village of Arden, Delaware, where she lived for many years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Political career</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ella became involved in several reform movements including the prohibitionist Women&#8217;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and women&#8217;s suffrage. She was the author of two books for children, Three Little Lovers of Nature (1895) and Talks About Authors and Their Work (1899).\nGene Debs, railroad union organizer and key figure in the Social Democracy of America.</p>\n\n<p>In 1897 Ella was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America, a new organization established by her friend Eugene V. Debs and Victor Berger &#8212; a group which would later emerge as the Social Democratic Party (SDP). She later recalled:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"When I joined the Social Democracy I was living in Brooklyn and I had married for the second time. My husband, Louis Cohen, was a socialist. I was pregnant with the first of the two children of that marriage. The railroad men [Debs supporters] came to my house so I could continue to act as [local] secretary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"But a new disappointment was in store for me. The Social Democracy, I soon discovered, was a utopian scheme. Debs&#8217; plan was to form an ideal colony out West to show by example that socialism could work. From the outset I told the members of my group that this colonization scheme was unsound, not real socialism at all. I stayed with it for a while because of my loyalty to Debs, and because this was the nearest thing I had yet found to a socialist movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"Debs set up a paper in Chicago called  <em>The Social Democrat</em>. At his request I wrote a children&#8217;s column for it. The children answered the appeals of Debs and his colonization committee by sending me money. I felt it was unfair to collect money for something that did not yet exist. People were already selling out businesses to join the colony. A national convention was held in Chicago [June 7-11, 189 and our local sent delegates. Among them was my husband who still felt that anything Debs was in must be all right. I agreed to withhold final judgment until the delegates returned. When they came back and reported that plans to establish the colony would continue, I resigned. I simply could not stay with anything so unscientific.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after her resignation from the Social Democracy, Ella attended a meeting in New York of the Socialist Labor Party, at which editor of the party newspaper Daniel DeLeon was the speaker:</p>\n \n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"He was small and slight and prematurely gray, and spoke very deliberately and convincingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"The Socialist Labor Party was a revolutionary party in those days and DeLeon, its leader, was a brilliant theoretician and speaker, a courageous fighter against capitalism.... I was impressed with his analysis of the evils of the capitalist system, and of the fallacy of isolated socialist colonies as a way of achieving socialism. I felt that at last here was scientific socialism and joined the SLP.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"Daniel DeLeon and I became friends.... I became very much interested in the New York Labor News Company &#8212; the first organization that published revolutionary books and pamphlets in English on a large scale. Its manager was Julien Pierce. Together we proofread the pamphlets translated by DeLeon, often having o reconstruct the English, a greater task than we ever let him know.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ella was elected to the governing General Executive Board of the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance (ST&amp;LA), the SLP&#8217;s trade union affiliate. She was also the ST&amp;LA&#8217;s organizer for Essex County, New Jersey and was sent to Philadelphia by the organization in an effort to organize street car workers there.</p>\n\n<p>Ella recounted her growing disaffection with the SLP in her 1940 memoir:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"Gradually the defects of the SLP were brought home to me. I found many workers antagonistic because I was organizing a rival union. The STLA was weakening the AF of L by drawing off its more radical elements and leaving the reactionaries in control, and was itself organized on too narrow and sectarian a basis to accomplish anything. Furthermore, the SLP as a political party had little real influence because DeLeon was against taking part in the immediate struggles of the workers.... I began very early to see the importance of a united trade union movement, and felt that Socialists should work within the AF of L. I felt that DeLeon understood Marx very well abstractly but knew little about the practical needs of the labor movement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">    \"The last time I talked with DeLeon I told him I was moving to Philadelphia and was willing to accept the secretaryship of the SLP local there, which had been offered me, but I could not go along with their principles wholeheartedly. As a good friend of mine, DeLeon accepted what I said without anger, but would not change his methods.\"</p>\n\n<p>Soon after her arrival in Philadelphia, a state convention of the SLP decided to leave the party en masse to form a new organization in the nether region between Morris Hillquit&#8217;s dissident so-called \"Kangaroo\" faction which broke away in 1899 and DeLeon&#8217;s hardline SLP. Ella opposed this new organization, which called itself \"The Logical Center\" and included Lucien Sanial, a former top official in the SLP. Ella had been watching with interest the formation of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1901 and decided to leave her new Pennsylvania comrades to rejoin her friend Gene Debs as a member of his new organization.</p>\n\n<p>In subsequent years, Ella worked as a trade union organizer and helped during industrial disputes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and New York. In 1905 she helped a fellow member of the Socialist Party of America, the author, Upton Sinclair, to gather information on the Chicago stock yards. This material eventually appeared in Sinclair&#8217;s best-selling book, The Jungle. Rumour has it that Sinclair sent her along with a Mr. Bloor as a faux couple to be able to innocently gather data on the meat yards of Chicago. Although they were not married, Ella adopted the name Mother Bloor.</p>\n\n<p>A leading figure in the Socialist Party of America, she ran several times unsuccessfully for political office, including secretary of state for Connecticut, Governor of Pennsylvania, and Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1918.</p>\n\n<p>Ella Reeve Bloor was an adherent of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of America exited that organization form the Communist Labor Party. In 1921 and 1922 attended the second conventions of the Comintern in Moscow. She was also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party USA from 1932 to 1948.</p>\n\n<p>After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Bloor became an advocate of American participation in World War II. Later she argued for an early invasion of Europe to create a Second Front.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Death and legacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ella Reeve Bloor died on August 10, 1951 in Richlandtown, Pennsylvania. She is buried in Harleigh Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey.1</p>\n\n<p>Bloor&#8217;s autobiography, We Are Many, was published in 1940 and served as the basis for the Woody Guthrie song, \"1913 Massacre.\" </p>\n\n\n"

        "content": "\r\nOne of the foremost scientists of the 20th century, Bohr was the first to apply the quantum theory to the problem of atomic and molecular structure. He was a guiding spirit and major contributor to the development of quantum physics; leader of the renowned Copenhagen School which struggled to work out a consistent materialist understanding of physical science during the unfolding of quantum and relativistic discoveries, Bohr maintained a long dialogue with Einstein over the meaning of these developments, and is responsible for the <em>Correspondence Principle</em>, one of the most important concepts for the understanding of the relation between quantum events and experience in the &#8220;macro-world&#8221;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bohr was brought up in a wealthy and influential Copenhagen family, his father a renowned physiologist and his brother a mathematician. After completing his doctorate in the electron theory of metal at the University of Copenhagn, Bohr joined J.J. Thomson at Cambridge, but in 1912 joined Rutherford&#8217;s in Manchester, a group studying the structure of the atom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was here that Bohr worked on the theoretical implications of Rutherford&#8217;s nuclear model of the atom and he was among the first to see the importance of the number of electrons in an atom&#8217;s structure in determining the physical and chemical properties of an element. Bohr was the first to see that a stable atomic structure was possible if energy levels were inherently restricted to discrete levels, a possibility made conceiveable by Max Planck&#8217;s discovery of the discrete properties of radiation spectra. Bohr succeeded in deriving the observed line spectrum of light emitted by atomic hydrogen from an analysis of the electron structure of the hydrogen atom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bohr returned to Copenhagen in 1912, and was appointed to a professorship from which position he led research into the fundamental quantum physics for the rest of his life, with many of the great physicists of the period, including <a href=\"../h/e.htm#heisenberg-werner\">Werner Heisenberg</a> coming to work in Copenhagen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to imagine the situation in which physicists were working in this period as research continued to produce mathematical entities which defied any attempt to visualise there physical meaning, other than being part of equations which accurately predicted experimental results, and indeed the experimental results themselves seemed to totally defy logical comprehension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the early 1920s, Bohr to piece together the theory of sub-atomic behaviour based on the quantum conception, and perhaps his most important achievement was the formulation of two general principles which he used to guide the interpretation of quantum theory: the <em>Complementarity Principle</em> and the application of the <em>Correspondence Principle</em> first developed by Einstein in his formulation of Relativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Correspondence Principle, as applied by Einstein, the predictions of Relativistic equations had to <em>converge</em> to those of Newtonian mechanics, for small speeds and masses; in application to quantum mechanics, Bohr held that there had to be a correspondence between each &#8216;energy jump&#8217; predicted by the quantum hypothesis and the frequency of light emissions observable and describable by classical mechanics, given that the frequency of light is related to its energy by a fixed ratio, Planck&#8217;s constant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Complementarity Principle, a quantum interaction must be describable in terms of wave-concepts <em>and</em> in terms of particle-concepts, and the two descriptions are together taken as a complete description of the properties of the interacting objects, despite the fact that no interaction can simultaneously correlate with both systems of concepts completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early years, Bohr stressed the tentative and symbolic nature of the atomic models that were being used, but as the theory continued to consolidate he came to the view that quantum mechanics was a valid representation of reality, and that the statistical interpretation of the field equation had to be accepted as a complete description of a system, rather than indicating the action of an as yet undiscovered type of interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Bohr&#8217;s view has come to be accepted by the great majority of physicists, <a href=\"../../people/e/i.htm#einstein-albert\">Albert Einstein</a> retained his assertion that the quantum theory offered an incomplete description of physical reality to the end, and looked forward to the development of a Unified Field Theory to provide the hoped-for complete description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm\" target=\"_top\">his account of his discussions with Einstein</a>, Bohr emphasised how important Einstein&#8217;s challenging objections had been to the evolution of his own ideas and what a deep and lasting impression they had made on him and there is no doubt that this respect was reciprocated by Einstein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1930s Bohr continued to work on the epistemological problems raised by the quantum theory and also contributed to nuclear physics.

        "content": "\r\nSimón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar Palacios y Blanco, &#8216;<em>El Liberator</em>&#8217; of Latin Americans under the Spanish Monarchy and President of the first independent Latin American union (1819&ndash;1830) the Gran Colombia (present day Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela). The man commonly referred to as Simón Bolívar was post-mortem considered to be a revolutionary hero in former Gran Colombia nations, yet was scrutinised heavily by Karl Marx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolívar was reared in Caracas, Venezuela in an aristocratic family of noble Basque descent. He was the youngest of three children, whom were raised mostly by his family slave Hipolita. Bolívar&#8217;s father Coronel Don Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte died when he was two years of age, and after his mother Maria Juanita Cabeza Grande died when he was eight years of age. After which, Bolívar passed under the guardianship of many tutors and professors, specifically Don Simón Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the most influential in transmitting enlightened philosophy and ideas to Bolívar, in particular those of Liberalism, Free Trade, and Republicanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the age of 14 Bolívar enlisted in the military academy of Veraguas in Panama after Rodriguez was accused of conspiracy against the Spanish crown. At the age of 21 he witnessed the coronation of Napoleon in Paris. It is said that his vehemence for Latin American emancipation is a fruition of this event. Bolívar returned to Venezuela in 1807 and after a successful junta, and the formation of the United Provinces of New Granada in 1810, was given command of the nation&#8217;s army, with the sole aim of ejecting Spanish presence in Latin America. After the failed establishment of a Venezuelan Republic in 1812, Bolívar wrote the <em>Cartagena Manifesto</em> which outlined his opinions concerning the causes of its fall &#8211; specifically the use of federalism, republicanism, and the Roman Catholic Church, all of which he viewed as opponents to a state in the time of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1813 Bolívar launched offensives in Venezuela (known as the Admirable Campaign), where he was bestowed the informal title of <em>El Liberator</em> after a restoration of the Venezuelan Republic. This republic was short lived, when it was reinstated in monarchist hands after a rebellion led by José Tomás Boves in 1814. After putting down a republican rebellion in Bogota which soon rose again, he was forced to reinforce the area with assistance from a foreign army in 1815. After pleading in Jamaica and failing, he managed to gain the support of Alexandre Pétion, the leader of newly independent Haiti. It is here that it is debated whether Bolívar was previously opposed to slavery or whether he only opposed it after his meeting with Pétion, but it is certain that Pétion would not supply reinforcements if Bolívar continued to support slavery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1817 Bolívar and his Haitian soldiers initiated the independence campaign for Gran Colombia which was won at the Battle of Boyacá in 1819. From a consolidated base in Gran Colombia Bolívar defeated the Royalist forces of Venezuela at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821 and Ecuador at the Battle of Pichincha in 1822. The new empire of Gran Colombia inevitably had Bolívar as its president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1824 Bolívar conquered Peru and was named Dictator of Peru by the Peruvian Congress. After the Battle of Ayacucho all Spanish forces in Latin America were annihilated. Bolívar at the Congress of Upper Peru in 1825 declared the creation of the Republic of Bolívia, one of the few countries to be named after a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the constitution of Bolívia reflected French and Scottish Enlightenment values, as well as those of classical philosophy, Bolívar moved to pen a new constitution of all Gran Colombia in response to a number of rebellions in Venezuela. The constitution allowed him presidency for life of a Centralized Gran Colombian state, as well as the right to select a successor. In theory the presidency was under congressional control by a system of checks and balances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debates at this time in the Convention of Ocana in early 1828 appeared to favour a more Republican Federalist style of government, yet Bolívarian delegates withdrew from the Convention as a reaction, thus making the Convention redundant. As a last resort to achieve his aims, Bolívar declared himself dictator through the <em>Decree of Dictatorship</em> in August, 1828. This was a move intended to consolidate central power over all of Gran Colombia, which would theoretically be only temporary. He was almost a victim of an assassination attempt, and eventually overwhelming rebellion in New Grenada, Venezuela and Ecuador forced him into exile in 1830. He resigned his presidency yet died as a result of tuberculosis in Santa Marta, New Grenada before departing on December 17, 1830.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a February 14, 1858 letter to Engels, Marx describes Bolívar as the &#8220;dastardly, most miserable and meanest of blackguards,&#8221; and sarcastically remarks that to &#8220;[describe him] as Napoleon I was altogether too much. Bolivar is a veritable Soulouque (the former slave, later President of Haiti).&#8221; It is clear that Bolívar can easily be described as a Bonapartist, yet is considered by many contemporary Latin Americans (as well as most Latin Americans since the 1840s) as the liberator of their nations &#8211; even though their nations exist as a result of uprisings against his centralized Imperial Gran Colombian body. Venezuela, for example is officially a Bolivarian republic. Consequently, it can be concluded that Bolívar is a modern symbol of Liberty for Latin Americans regardless of his Imperial Bonapartist tendencies. This tendency towards the usage of Bolívar as a symbol of Liberty is displayed in the Argentinean Trotskyist Nahuel Moreno&#8217;s opinion that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Bolivar&#8217;s thinking was the most advanced and internationalist of the first Latin American struggles for independence, thinking that today is continued in proletarian internationalism of the most advanced revolutionaries in Latin America, the Trotskyists.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\"><em>Further Reading:</em> Bolívar is portrayed by Marx in a manner which was deemed to be written in a &#8216;partisan style&#8217; by the managing editor of the <em>New York Tribune</em> Charles Dana in this article: Karl Marx in the <em>New American Encyclopedia</em> 1858: <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1858/01/bolivar.htm\" target=\"_top\"><em>Bolivar y Ponte</em></a>.

He engaged in an extended exchange of letters with Ernst Mach, but was unable to formulate a clear critique of Mach&#8217;s views, and never published a considered formulation of his epistemology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boltzmann received his doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1866, and he went on to professorships in mathematics and physics at Vienna, Graz, Munich, and Leipzig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1870s Boltzmann published a series of papers in which he derived the second law of thermodynamics (that every process in nature increases the total entropy in the system and is thus essentially irreversible), from the laws of mechanics and the theory of probability applied to the motions of the atoms. In this way, Boltzmann showed that Entropy, which had previously been understood only in terms of its derivation from the work-energy equations of classical physics, was a <em>statistical</em> measure. This lead to the conception of the equilibrium state of a thermal system as the &#8220;most probable state&#8221;. These studies led to the formulation of the theorem of &#8220;equipartition of energy&#8221;. Perhaps his most startling achievement is his famous equation S=k.logW expresses the equivalence between Entropy (S) and the &#8220;probability&#8221; of a state (W).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though his work on statistical mechanics was strongly attacked and long-misunderstood, his conclusions were finally supported by the discoveries in atomic physics that began shortly before 1900 and by recognition that phenomena such as Brownian motion, could be explained only by statistical mechanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is noteworthy that while Boltzmann was possibly the first physicist to introduce mathematical formulations of physical laws which challenged intuitive and visual representation of the physical world, he was a staunch advocate of philosophical materialism and a life-long opponent of all attempts to give succour to subjective idealism from the strange discoveries of modern physics. Boltzmann left no philosophical writings, but the notes taken from his impromptu lectures and his numerous letters to <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst\">Ernst Mach</a> and <a href=\"../../people/b/r.htm#brentano-franz\">Franz Brentano</a>, collected and published by his family, show his struggle against the sceptical conclusions being drawn by many scientists at the turn of the century, and in this sense he was a precursor of <a href=\"../../people/e/i.htm#einstein-albert\">Einstein</a>. He found the issues very confusing and became increasingly demoralised by his inability to resolve the questions being thrown up by the revolutionary development taking place in physics and eventually committed suicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n"

Boudin was born Louis Boudianoff in imperial Russia on December 15, 1874. He was born into a middle-class family, the son of a shirt manufacturer. The family emigrated to America in 1891 and settled in New York City. Louis worked in the garment industry as a shirtmaker and as a private tutor. At the same time, Boudin began legal studies, gaining a Master&#8217;s Degree from New York University and being admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Political career</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In America, Boudin was first a member of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP).

Boudin was also a delegate to the United Hebrew Trades organization in New York City at that same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boudin wrote his first political articles in the Yiddish language, contributing works on aesthetics and the materialist conception of history (historical materialism) to such publications as <em>Di Zukunft</em> and <em>Di Naye Geist</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boudin left the Socialist Labor Party during the party fight of 1899, casting his lot with the dissident faction headed by Morris Hillquit and Henry Slobodin. This dissident SLP organization would eventually become one of the main pillars of the new Socialist Party of America, established in the summer of 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From May 1905 through October 1906, Boudin wrote a series of articles expounding upon Marxism which were published in the Chicago magazine <em>The International Socialist Review</em>. These articles were collected in book form as <em>The Theoretical System of Karl Marx in the Light of Recent Criticism</em> in February 1907.The title was published by the leading radical publishing house of the day, Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., and was kept in print continuously over the next two decades through several reissue editions. The book, a defense of such orthodox Marxist tenanets as the labor theory of value and historical materialism against their critics of the day, established Boudin&#8217;s place as one of the foremost American authorities on Marxism among a generation of young political activists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boudin was elected a delegate of the Socialist Party of America to the 1907 Stuttgart Congress and the 1910 Copenhagen Congress of the Second International.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boudin was frequently a candidate for public office on the Socialist Party ticket. He ran for Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1910, 1914 and 1917, and for Chief Judge in 1916. He also ran for Justice of the New York Supreme Court (2nd District) in 1910, 1912, 1919.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Ludwig Lore and Louis C. Fraina, Boudin was a founding editor of <em>The Class Struggle</em>, a Marxist theoretical magazine which first saw print in May 1917. <em>The Class Struggle</em> published news and commentary about revolutionary socialist events in Europe, including translations of works by some of the leading figures of the Zimmerwald Left, and was an important influence on the formation of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party in 1919 &#8212; a group which provided the core of the Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party later in that year. Boudin had left the project by this juncture, however, as a brief notice in the September&ndash;October 1918 issue indicated that he had resigned his position as an editor and member of the Socialist Publication Society owing to &#8220;differences concerning the policy of the magazine.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Life after politics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the formation of the Communist Labor Party of America and the Communist Party of America, Boudin shied away from organized politics. He did, however, teach in the Communist Party-sponsored Workers&#8217; School in New York in the late 1920s and occasionally contributed articles to the CP&#8217;s artistic magazine, <em>The New Masses</em> during the latter half of the 1930s. Boudin repudiated communism by 1940, although he remained a staunch defender of the civil liberties of Communist Party members.\r\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s Boudin was a frequent contributor of book reviews to scholarly journals such as the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>, <em>The American Journal of Sociology</em>, and <em>The Journal of Politics</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to working as a lawyer, winning several cases related to the rights of workers to organize trade unions, Boudin also wrote a two volume work called <em>Government by Judiciary</em>, revisiting a topic which he had dealt with in a previous shorter book. In this work, never much read by the radical movement of the day, Boudin argued that the democratic rights of the people had been usurped by the judicial branch of government. While not influential with political activists of the period, Boudin&#8217;s book remained in use among law students for decades, according to historian Paul Buhle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <strong>Death and legacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louis Boudin died in 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His papers reside at Columbia University in New York City and include the manuscript of an unpublished book, <em>Order Out of Chaos</em>, a study of economic crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../b.htm\">Index of the Letter B</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"updat\">Last updated on 21 May 2022</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n"

Prime Minister of Sweden, serving for three separate periods in 1920, 1922-1923, and 1924-1925. Awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 1921. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBorn in Stockholm, Branting was the only child of Professor Lars Branting, one of the principal developers of the Swedish school of gymnastics. He was educated at the exclusive Beskow School in Stockholm, passing his matriculation examination at the age of seventeen, with a distinguished record in mathematics and Latin. After studying at the University of Uppsala for the next five years, concentrating on mathematics and astronomy, he accepted a position in 1882 as an assistant to the director of the Stockholm Observatory. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Branting was a social scientist as well as a natural scientist. By 1880 he had adopted liberal views, which had their origin in his studies and observations on social and cultural questions. In 1881 when he learned that the Stockholm Workers Institute, which provided lectures and courses of study for workingmen, had been denied financial support by the city, he contributed from his personal funds the amount necessary to keep the Institute open. For Branting the year of 1883 proved decisive. In Paris he heard the lectures of the French Socialist, Paul Lafargue; in Zurich he learned about German socialist doctrine from Eduard Bernstein, who was publishing Der Sozial-Demokrat while in self-imposed exile; wherever he went - including Russia - he tested his thinking in discussion with workingmen and social philosophers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGiving up his scientific career in 1884, Branting joined the staff of the radical Stockholm paper <em>Tiden</em> [The Times] as foreign editor. He became editor-in-chief the next year but, like his predecessor in that office, was unable to solve the financial crises which periodically afflicted the paper. Upon its demise in 1886, Branting became chief editor of another socialist newspaper, Socialdemokraten, making this journal, in the course of his thirty-one years' association with it, a textbook for the education of the workers and a potent force in Swedish politics. Radical though Branting was, he taught evolution rather than revolution, believing that true democracy could not exist without the active involvement of the workingmen and that any socialist philosophy not based on the democratic concept was a mockery.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBranting formed workingmen's clubs, helped to organize unions, supported strikes, directed strategy. In demand as a speaker at innumerable meetings, he became one of the most skillful speakers in the land, noted for his logical argument, precision of style, blunt honesty, warmth of personality. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was the directing genius behind the formation of the Social Democratic Labor Party in 1889, serving as its president from 1907 until his death. To advance the aspirations of the workingman, political action should, he believed, be enmeshed with industrial action, not superimposed upon it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElected to the Lower Chamber of the Parliament in 1896 from a workingmen's constituency in Stockholm, Branting was the sole Social Democrat to hold a seat until 1902. In Parliament he gave visibility to the rights of workers, decried legislation against unions, pled for universal suffrage, supported national defence, and advocated peaceful solution of the crisis between Sweden and Norway over the dissolution of the union in 1905. Meanwhile, the power of his party grew: in 1902 there were four Social Democrats out of a total membership of 230 in the Lower Chamber of the Parliament; in 1903, thirteen; in 1908, thirty-four; in 1911, sixty-four; in 1914, seventy-two; in 1921, a hundred and ten.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1917, the Social Democrats were a strong third party in what had traditionally been a two-party system. In that year the Social Democrats joined the Liberals in a coalition government, with Branting as minister of finance. The coalition sponsored the constitutional reform of 1919, extending the franchise to all males (women receiving the vote in 1921 under Branting's government), but it was dissolved when the Liberals refused to support the Social Democrats' demands for tax reform, unemployment insurance, and nationalization. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBranting then formed his first government, depending upon Liberal support since he did not command a majority in Parliament. When the power of the Liberal Party appeared to be diminishing, he dissolved the Parliament in October of 1920, but the ensuing elections went against him. He returned to the prime ministry in October, 1921, retaining the foreign affairs portfolio and departed in April, 1923, when faced by a combination of the Liberals and Conservatives. When the elections of 1924 gave the Social Democrats a majority over each of the other two parties, Branting, for the third time, became prime minister, resigning in January, 1925, when his health failed. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/branting/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Branting Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nAmerican communist and General Secretary of the Communist Party USA from 1934 to 1945. He was expelled from the party in 1946.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Early years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earl Browder was born in Wichita, Kansas on May 20, 1891, the eighth child of an American-born father sympathetic to populism.  He joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america\">Socialist Party of America</a> in Wichita in 1907 at the age of 16 and remained in that organization until the party split of 1912, when many of the group&#8217;s syndicalistically oriented members exited the organization in response to the addition of an anti-sabotage clause to the party constitution and the recall of National Executive Committeeman William &#8220;Big Bill&#8221; Haywood. Historian Theodore Draper notes that Browder &#8220;was influenced by an offshoot of the syndicalist movement which believed in working in the AF of L (American Federation of Labor).&#8221; This ideological orientation brought the young Browder into contact with <a href=\"../f/o.htm#foster-william\">William Z. Foster</a>, founder of an organization called the Syndicalist League of North America which was based upon similar policies and <a href=\"../c/a.htm#cannon-james\">James P. Cannon</a>, an IWW adherent from Kansas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browder moved to Kansas City and was employed as a office worker, entering the AF of L union of his trade, the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants union. In 1916 he took a job as manager of the Johnson County Cooperative Association in Olathe, Kansas.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browder was aggressively opposed to World War I and publicly spoke out against it, characterizing the fighting as an imperialist conflict. After the United States joined the war in 1917, Browder was arrested and charged under the Espionage Act conspiring to defeat the operation of the draft law and nonregistration. Browder was sentenced to 2 years in prison for conspiracy and 1 year for nonregistration, sitting in jail from December 1917 to November 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1919, Browder, Cannon, and their Kansas City associates started a radical newspaper, <a href=\"../../../history/usa/pubs/workersworld/index.htm\"><em>The Workers World</em></a>, with Browder serving as the first editor. In June of that year Browder was jailed again on a conspiracy charge, however, with Cannon taking over as editor. Browder&#8217;s second prison stint, served at Leavenworth Penitentiary, lasted until November of 1920, putting him out of circulation during the critical interval when the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party quit the SPA to form the Communist Party of America and the Communist Labor Party. A series of splits and mergers followed, with the two Communist parties formally merging in 1921.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Released from prison at last, Browder lost no time in joining the United Communist Party (UCP), as well as the fledgling Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) being launched by his old associate William Z. Foster. Browder found employment as the managing editor of the monthly magazine of TUEL, The Labor Herald.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1920 the Communist International (Comintern) headed by Gregory Zinoviev decided to establish an international confederation of Communist trade unions, the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU, or &#8220;Profintern&#8221;). A founding convention was planned to be held in Moscow in July of 1921 and an American delegation was gathered, including members of the American Communist Parties and the Industrial Workers of the World. Earl Browder was named to this delegation, ostensibly representing Kansas miners, with the non-party man Foster attending as a journalist representing the Federated Press.This trip to Soviet Russia incidentally proved decisive in bringing the syndicalist Foster over to the Communist movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the early 1920s, Browder and Foster worked together closely in the TUEL, trying to win over the support of the Chicago Federation of Labor in the establishment of a new mass Farmer-Labor Party that would be able to challenge the electoral hegemony of the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1928, the estranged Browder and his lover Kitty Harris went to China and lived in Shanghai where they worked together on behalf of RILU&#8217;s Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, a Comintern organization engaged in clandestine labor organizing. The pair returned to the United States in 1929.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CPUSA leadership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browder became General Secretary of the Communist party in 1930 and took over the top position of party chairman in 1932 after William Z. Foster suffered a heart attack. During his term as General Secretary, Browder embraced the popular front tactic and led the CPUSA&#8217;s tactic of expressing support for the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt, while demanding that it should go much farther in terms of restructuring the capitalist system. Browder was the party&#8217;s candidate for President of the United States in the 1936 presidential election but won only 80,195 votes. During this time, Browder made at least one and possibly two trips to the Soviet Union on a false U.S. passport. After admitting he had traveled on a false passport in a public statement, he was tried and sentenced to prison in 1940 for passport violations. Browder was released after 14 months when the United States joined World War II and became an ally of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1944, perceiving the end of the war and the possibility of postwar tension between Washington and Moscow, Browder made moves to distance the CPUSA from the Soviet Union, declaring that communism and capitalism could peacefully co-exist. This policy became known in the Party as Browderism. The CPUSA reconstituted itself as the Communist Political Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expulsion from the CPUSA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the end of the Great Power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, &#8220;Browderism&#8221; came under attack from the rest of the international Communist movement. In 1945, Jacques Duclos, a leader of the French Communist Party, published an article denouncing Browder&#8217;s policy. With the Comintern having been dissolved during the war, the &#8220;Duclos letter&#8221; was used to informally communicate Moscow&#8217;s views. William Z. Foster, Browder&#8217;s predecessor and a staunch Marxist-Leninist, led the opposition to Browder within the party and replaced him as party chairman in 1945, with Eugene Dennis taking over as General Secretary. Browder was expelled from the party in 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browder continued to campaign for his views outside the Party and criticized the CPUSA&#8217;s domination by Moscow, writing that &#8220;The American Communists had thrived as champions of domestic reform. But when the Communists abandoned reforms and championed a Soviet Union openly contemptuous of America while predicting its quick collapse, the same party lost all its hard-won influence. It became merely a bad word in the American language.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 1950, Browder was called to testify before a Senate Committee investigating Communist activity. Questioned by Joseph McCarthy, Browder was willing to criticize the American Communist Party but refused to answer questions that would incriminate former comrades. He falsely testified under oath that he had never been involved in espionage activities. Browder was charged with contempt of Congress, but Judge F. Dickinson Letts ordered his acquittal because he felt the committee had not acted legally. Browder was never prosecuted for his espionage work on behalf of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browder&#8217;s final public appearance was in a debate with Max Shachtman, the dissident Trotskyist, in which the pair debated socialism. Browder defended the Soviet Union while Shachtman acted as a prosecutor. It is reported that at one point in the debate Shachtman listed a series of leaders of various Communist Parties and noted that each had perished at the hands of Stalin; at the end of this speech, he remarked that Browder too had been a leader of a Communist Party and, pointing at him, announced: &#8220;There-there but for an accident of geography, stands a corpse!&#8221; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An attempt to reinstate Browder in the CPUSA following the Twentieth Party Congress and the move to destalinization failed. He remained outside of the party until his death in Princeton, New Jersey on June 27, 1973.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\"><a href=\"../../../archive/browder/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Earl Browder Archive</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">[Composed by Tim Davenport]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His father was staunchly anti-slavery and was a voluntary agent for the &#8220;Underground Railroad.&#8221;</p> \r\n<p>\r\nBrown had a variety of different jobs including tanner, wool merchant, land surveyor and farmer, and was the father of twenty children to two wives. In 1849, Brown and his family settled in a black community founded in North Elba on land donated by the Anti-Slavery campaigner, Gerrit Smith.</p> \r\n<p>\r\nWhile at North Elba, he became convinced that force was necessary to overthrow slavery. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, Brown recruited forty-four men into the United States League of Gileadites, an organization founded to resist slave-catchers. </p> \r\n<p>\r\nIn 1855 Brown and five of his sons moved to Kansas Territory to help anti-slavery forces obtain control of this region. His home in Osawatomie was burned in 1856 and one of his sons was killed. With the support of prominent Abolitionists, he moved to Virginia and established a refuge for runaway slaves. </p> \r\n<p>\r\nIn 1859, he led a successful attack on the federal armory at Harper's Ferry. Brown hoped that his action would encourage slaves to join his rebellion, enabling him to form an emancipation army. But two days later the armory was stormed by Robert E. Lee and a company of marines. Brown and six men barricaded themselves in an engine-house, and continued to fight until Brown was seriously wounded and two of his sons had been killed. </p> \r\n<p>\r\nHe was tried and convicted of insurrection, treason and murder and hung with six other on 2nd December, 1859.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/brown-john/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">John Brown Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\n<p>\r\nBunting was a founder member and principal architect of the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA). Bunting was born in London in 1873, the great grandson of Jabez Bunting, the Wesleyan leader, and the son of Percy Bunting, who was the first editor of the Contemporary Review. His mother did social work among London&#8217;s poor. Bunting graduated from Oxford and came to South Africa in 1900 with British forces in the Boer War. He decided to remain and take up legal studies, eventually establishing a law practice in Johannesburg. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1910 he had become sympathetic to the views of the Labour Party, and in March 1914 he was elected to the Transvaal provincial council on its ticket. He subsequently broke with the party on the issue of participation in the war, and together with W.H. Andrews and others he split away to form the anti-war International Socialist League (ISL). By the time the CPSA was formed in 1921, Bunting had broken completely with the labour movement, though he continued to believe that the white workers would eventually see the need to unite on class lines with workers of other races. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1922 Bunting went to Moscow to attend the fourth Congress of the Communist International. On his return he took over a secretary ship of the CPSA from Andrews, and in 1924 he was elected party chairman. The Industrial and Commercial Workers&#8217; Union of Clements Kadalie was then becoming a force to be reckoned with, and Bunting&#8217;s belief in the potential for trade unionism among blacks no longer seemed as far-fetched as it once had to some in the ISL. Under his leadership the CPSA turned seriously to the recruitment of Africans. When support from white socialists proved inadequate, Bunting paid party expenses from his own pocket. Through his legal defence of political radicals, he won much African goodwill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe 1928 Comintern decision that South African communists were to advocate a &#8220;Native Republic&#8221; came as a shock to Bunting, who rightly foresaw that the slogan would decimate the party. With Edward Roux, Bunting and his wife Rebecca went to Moscow to the sixth Comintern congress in 1928 to argue against the new doctrine. They were unsuccessful, however, and Bunting found himself castigated as a white chauvinist and right-wing deviationist. He reluctantly accepted the Comintern directive and returned to South Africa to make the most of the new policy. In the 1929 election year, Bunting ran as a Communist candidate in Tembuland in the Transkei, where almost half the electorate was black. Police harassment was intense, and he polled only 289 votes. Following the campaign, Bunting and Roux began an abortive effort to organize the League of African Rights, which they hoped would become a socialist-oriented mass movement for Africans, but Moscow ordered the league dissolved.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeing an empiricist more than a philosopher, according to his biographer Edwards Roux, Bunting was always vulnerable to the charge that he was deficient in Communist theory. Acknowledging this deficiency, he remained loyal to the Communist cause and to Soviet leadership even when his own judgement put him in conflict with Comintern policy. When Douglas Wolton returned to South Africa to South Africa in 1930 with instructions to eliminate &#8220;chauvinists&#8221; and &#8220;social democrats&#8221; from the party leadership, Bunting came under fierce attack and was expelled in September 1931. Drained financially and, for health reasons, unable to carry on with his law practise, his took a job as a viola player in a Johannesburg orchestra. Later when a stroke had partially paralyzed his fingers, he found employment as a building superintendent. A prolific writer to the end, he produced a pamphlet in 1933, An African Prospect and Appeal to Young Africa, East, West, Central, South calling for the establishment of a socialist order on a continental scale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnlike Andrews, Bunting did not live to win readmission to the CPSA following the ultra-left period of the 1930&#8217;s. He died of a stroke in1936. A group of his friends subscribed an annual scholarship in his name at Fort Hare University, and Edwards Roux wrote an account of his life, S. P Bunting: A political Biography, which appeared on 1944.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSource: Karis, T.G. &amp; Gerhart, G.M..

        "content": "\r\nAmerican popular political theorist, best known for his influential work <em>The Managerial Revolution</em>, published in 1941. Radical activist in the 1930s and an important factional leader of the American Trotskyist movement, near the end of the Great Depression he broke with the <a href=\"../../orgs/u/n.htm#usslp\">Socialist Workers Party (U.S.)</a> and later became a part of right-wing movements such as McCarthyism.</p>\r\n<p>Born in Chicago, Illinois, James Burnham was the son of Claude George Burnham, an English immigrant and executive with the Burlington Railroad. James was raised as a Roman Catholic stock but rejected Catholicism as a college student, professing atheism for much of his life (although returning to the church shortly before his death). He graduated at the top of his class at Princeton University before attending Balliol College, Oxford.</p>\r\n<p>A member of the A.J. Muste&#8217;s American Workers Party in the early 1930s, Burnham supported the 1934 merger with the Communist League of America which formed the U.S. Workers Party. In 1935 he allied with the Trotskyist wing of that party and favored fusion with the Socialist Party of America. However, Burnham&#8217;s engagement with Trotskyism was short-lived: from 1937 a number of disagreements came to the fore.</p>\r\n<p>In 1937 the Trotskyists were expelled from the Socialist Party, an action which led to the formation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) at the end of the year. Inside the SWP, Burnham allied with Max Shachtman in a faction fight over the position of the SWP&#8217;s majority faction, led by James P. Cannon and backed by Leon Trotsky, defending the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers state against the incursions of imperialism. Shachtman and Burnham, especially after witnessing the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939 and the invasions of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by the Stalin regime, as well as the Soviet invasion of Finland in November 1939, came to contend that the USSR was a new form of imperialistic class society and was thus not worthy of even critical support from the socialist movement.</p>\r\n<p>After a protracted discussion inside the SWP, in which the factions argued their case in a series of heated internal discussion bulletins, the special 3rd National Convention of the organization in early April 1940 decided the question in favor of the Cannon majority by a vote of 55-31. Even though the majority sought to avoid a split by offering to continue the debate and to allow proportional representation of the minority on the party&#8217;s governing National Committee, Shachtman, Burnham, and their supporters resigned from the SWP to launch their own organization, again called the Workers Party.</p>\r\n<p>This break also marked the end of Burnham&#8217;s participation in the radical movement, however. On May 21, 1940, he addressed a letter to the National Committee of the Workers Party resigning from the organization. In it he made it clear the distance he had moved away from Marxism:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;I reject, as you know, the &#8216;philosophy of Marxism,&#8217; dialectical materialism...</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The general Marxian theory of &#8216;universal history,&#8217; to the extent that it has any empirical content, seems to me disproved by modern historical and anthropological investigation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Marxian economics seems to me for the most part either false or obsolete or meaningless in application to contemporary economic phenomena. Those aspects of Marxian economics which retain validity do not seem to me to justify the theoretical structure of the economics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Not only do I believe it meaningless to say that &#8216;socialism is inevitable&#8217; and false that socialism is &#8216;the only alternative to capitalism&#8217;; I consider that on the basis of the evidence now available to us a new form of exploitive society (which I call &#8216;managerial society&#8217;) is not only possible but is a more probable outcome of the present than socialism. </p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;On no ideological, theoretic or political ground, then, can I recognize, or do I feel, any bond or allegiance to the Workers Party (or to any other Marxist party). That is simply the case, and I can no longer pretend about it, either to myself or to others.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In 1941, Burnham wrote a book analyzing the development of economics and society as he saw it, called <em>The Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World.</em></p>\r\n<p>During World War II, Burnham went on to work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\r\n<p>After the war, he called for an aggressive strategy to undermine the Soviet Union&#8217;s power. During the Cold War, he regularly wrote for the National Review magazine. In 1983, conservative Republican President Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Burnham&#8217;s ideas were an important influence on both the paleoconservative and neoconservative factions of the American Right Wing.</p>\r\n<p>Burnham&#8217;s seminal work, <em>The Managerial Revolution,</em> attempted to theorize about the future of world capitalism based upon observations of its development in the interwar period. Burnham argued three possible futures for capitalism: (1) that capitalism was a permanent form of social and economic organization and that it would be continued for a protracted period of time; (2) that capitalism was a temporary form of organization destined by its nature to collapse and be replaced by socialism; (3) that capitalism was a temporary form of organization currently being transformed into some non-socialist future form of society. Burnham argued that since capitalism had a more or less definite beginning, which he dated to approximately the 14th Century, it could not be regarded as an immutable and permanent form. Moreover, Burnham observed that in the last years of previous forms of economic organization, such those of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, mass unemployment was &#8220;a symptom that a given type of social organization is just about finished.&#8221; The worldwide mass unemployment of the depression era was, for Burnham, indicative that capitalism was itself &#8220;not going to continue much longer.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Dust jacket of the 1941 edition of Burnham&#8217;s seminal work.</p>\r\n<p>Burnham looked around the world for indications of the new form of society which was emerging to replace historic capitalism and saw certain commonalities between the economic formations of Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and America under Franklin D. Roosevelt and his &#8220;New Deal.&#8221; Burnham argued that over a comparatively short period, which he dated from the first world war, a new society had emerged in which a &#8220;social group or class&#8221; which Burnham called &#8220;managers&#8221; had engaged in a &#8220;drive for social dominance, for power and privilege, for the position of ruling class.&#8221; For at least a decade previous to Burnham&#8217;s book, the idea of a &#8220;separation of ownership and control&#8221; of the modern corporation had been part of American economic thought, with Burnham citing <em>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</em> by Berle and Means as an important exposition. Burnham expanded upon this concept, arguing that whether ownership was corporate and private or statist and governmental, the essential demarcation between the ruling elite (executives and managers on the one hand, bureaucrats and functionaries on the other) and the mass of society was not ownership so much as it was control of the means of production.</p>\r\n<p>Burnham emphasized that &#8220;New Dealism,&#8221; as he called it, &#8220;is not, let me repeat, a developed, systematized managerial ideology.&#8221; Still, this ideology had contributed to American capitalism&#8217;s moving in a &#8220;managerial direction&#8221;:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;In its own more confused, less advanced way, New Dealism too has spread abroad the stress on the state as against the individual, planning as against private enterprise, jobs (even if relief jobs) against opportunities, security against initiative, &#8216;human rights&#8217; against &#8216;property rights.&#8217; There can be no doubt that the psychological effect of New Dealism has been what the capitalists say it has been: to undermine public confidence in capitalist ideas and rights and institutions. Its most distinctive features help to prepare the minds of the masses for the acceptance of the managerial social structure.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The conservative implications of Burnham&#8217;s ideas seem clear.</p>\r\n<p>In June 1941, a hostile review of <em>The Managerial Revolution</em> by Socialist Workers Party loyalist Joseph Hansen in the SWP&#8217;s theoretical magazine accused Burnham of having lifted the central ideas of his book &#8220;without acknowledging the source&#8221; from the Italian Bruno Rizzi and his 1939 book <em>La Bureaucratisation du Monde</em>. Despite certain similarities, there is no evidence Burnham knew of said book beyond Leon Trotsky&#8217;s brief references to it.</p>\r\n<p>In a later book, <em>The Machiavellians</em>, he argued and developed his theory that the emerging new élite would better serve its own interests if it retained some democratic trappings &#8211; political opposition, a free press, and a controlled &#8220;circulation of the élites.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>His 1964 book <em>Suicide of the West</em> became a classic text for the conservatives of the Right Wing movement in U.S. politics, defining liberalism as a &#8220;syndrome&#8221; rendering liberals ridden with guilt and internal contradictions. The works of James Burnham greatly influenced paleoconservative author Samuel Francis, who wrote two books about Burnham, and based his political theories upon the &#8220;managerial revolution&#8221; and the resulting managerial state.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../history/etol/writers/burnham/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">James Burnham Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nThe son of an engineer, was born in Lambeth, London on 20th October, 1858. After a brief education became an apprentice in the engineering industry. One of his fellow workers, Victor Delahaye, introduced Burns to radical writers such as John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1879 Burns joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and found employment with the United Africa Company. Horrified by the way the Africans were treated, Burns became convinced that only socialism would remove the inequalities between races and classes. He returned to England in 1881 and soon afterwards formed the Battersea branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). One of the first people to join was another young engineer, Tom Mann. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJohn Burns was elected to the executive council of the Social Democratic Federation and in the 1885 General Election was their unsuccessful candidate in Nottingham West. The following year he led a demonstration in London against unemployment. The march degenerated into a riot and Burns was arrested and charged with conspiracy and sedition. He was acquitted but in November, 1887, he was arrested with his friend, Robert Cunninghame Graham during the Bloody Sunday demonstration in London. This time he was sentenced to six weeks in prison. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn June, 1889, John Burns left the Social Democratic Federation after a disagreement with the party&#8217;s leader, H. Hyndman. Like his friend, Tom Mann, Burns was now convinced that socialism would be achieved through trade union activity rather than by parliamentary elections.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the London Dock Strike started in August 1889, Ben Tillett asked John Burns to help win the dispute. Burns, a passionate orator, helped to rally the dockers when they were considering the possibility of returning to work. He was also involved in raising money and gaining support from other trade unionists. During the dispute Burns emerged with Ben Tillett and Tom Mann as one of the three main leaders of the strike. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe employers hoped to starve the dockers back to work but other trade union activists such as Will Thorne, Eleanor Marx, James Keir Hardie and Henry Hyde Champion, gave valuable support to the 10,000 men now out on strike. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Labour Church raised money for the strikers and their families. Trade Unions in Australia sent over £30,000 to help the dockers to continue the struggle. After five weeks the employers accepted defeat and granted all the dockers&#8217; main demands.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns was now a well-known labour leader and in the elections for the newly created London County Council, he was elected to represent Battersea. At one of the meetings Burns managed to get a motion passed that stated that in future all Council work should only be awarded to those contractors who agreed to observe trade union standards on wages and working conditions.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the 1892 General Election John Burns was elected to represent Battersea in the House of Commons. Burns now joined the other socialist who won a seat in the election, James Keir Hardie. Whereas Burns was willing to work closely with the Liberal Party, Hardie argued for the formation of a new working class political party. Burns attended the meeting in 1900 that established the Labour Representation Committee, the forerunner of the Labour Party, but refused to join and continued to align himself to the Liberal Party.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns knew that the Liberal Party might win the next election whereas the Labour Party would take a long time before it was in a position to form a government. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 General Election, the new Prime Minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, offered John Burns the post of President of the Local Government Board.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns, the first member of the working-class to become a government minister, disappointed the labour movement with his period in office. Burns was responsible for only one important piece of legislation, the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909, during his time in government. Burns, who was now earning &pound;5,000 a year, was bitterly attacked in the House of Commons by old comrades such as Fred Jowett, when he argued for no outdoor relief to be given to the poor. Burns was reminded how he had been a strong critic of the Poor Law and the workhouse system when he had been a member of the Social Democratic Federation.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSupporters of Burns point out that he did have his successes. For example, he piloted through the House of Commons the 1910 Census Bill that sought to obtain more information about both family structure and urban conditions in order for the government to develop policies to tackle problems such as infant mortality and slum housing. By 1913 his administrative reforms had resulted in a more effective deployment of medical staff in the infirmaries.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns gradually began to question the growth in the Welfare State. He told a conference in August 1913, that the government and charity organisations should not &#8220;supersede the mother, and they should not by over-attention sterilise her initiative and capacity to do what every mother should be able to do for herself.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1914 Burns was appointed as President of the Board of Trade. However, soon afterwards, the British government decided to declare war on Germany. Burns was opposed to Britain becoming involved in a European conflict and along with John Morley and Charles Trevelyan, resigned from the government.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns, without the support of the Liberal Party or the Labour Party, and aware that the public felt hostile to those politicians who did not fully support Britain&#8217;s involvement in the First World War, decided not to stand in the 1918 General Election.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBurns played no further role in politics after 1918. The following year Andrew Carnegie left Burns an annuity of &pound;1,000. Burns spent the rest of his life on his hobbies: the history of London, book collecting and cricket. John Burns died on 24th January, 1943. </p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\nFrom Spartacus Schoolnet</p>\r\n\r\n"

He was awarded the Military Medal in the First World War for his service in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Along with Willie Gallagher, he was associated with the National Workers Committee, a syndicalist inspired workers organisation with close ties with the former Clyde Workers&#8217; Committee. He was also a foundation member of the Party. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe became notorious, following his arrest in 1924 for sedition. As acting editor of <em>Workers Weekly</em>, the Party paper, he had made an appeal in its columns to British troops. He was charged with inciting mutiny for his &#8216;Open letter to the fighting forces&#8217;&#8212;in which he called on soldiers and sailors to &#8220;turn your weapons on your oppressors&#8221;. The labour movement responded strongly to this attack on free speech, which merely sought the &#8216;neutrality&#8217; in class struggle that the British state always claimed for itself. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe minority Labour Government, the first, then failed to proceed with the prosecution. To the fury of the press, the Labour attorney general had decided to prosecute the charge of sedition since there was a dearth of valid evidence. The campaign against Labour was sealed with the infamous <em>Daily Mail</em> forgery, the &#8216;Zinoviev&#8217; letter. Both issues played some role in the excuse to overturn the government and force another general election after only nine months. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Communist Party produced a pamphlet detailing Campbell&#8217;s defence in court entitled <em>The Communist Party on Trial&#8212;J R Campbell&#8217;s Defence</em>. Campbell was also arrested in the police raid on the Party&#8217;s headquarters in preparation for the General Strike. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate in 1929, 1945 (when he stood for the Party in Greenock), 1950 and 1951. He joined Harry Pollitt in concern about the Party line opposing the war against Germany from 1939 until the German invasion of Russia in 1941, and served on the executive committee of the CPGB. He became editor of the <em>Daily Worker</em> in 1949. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe National Archives contain extensive security service files on Campbell, only released in recent times. One security file includes speculation that when Campbell was appointed editor of the <em>Daily Worker</em>, John Gollan, was simultaneously made assistant editor to watch Campbell and make sure that he followed the party line. There are extensive reports of Campbell&#8217;s activities from as far back as 1920, including reports of speeches made, cuttings of his journalistic work and general surveillance material. A bundle of documents from the security forces show detailed observation from 1933 to 1953 for the activities of Campbell&#8217;s wife, Sarah. A reports on Campbell&#8217;s arrest for obstruction at a Communist Party meeting in February 1937 was also retained by the security forces. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was editor of the <em>Daily Worker</em> in 1939, Assistant Editor from 1942-49 and Editor from 1949; he died in 1969. </p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From Graham Stevenson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/campbell-jr/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">J.

        "content": "\r\nGerman mathematician who founded modern Set Theory and introduced the concept of transfinite numbers, indefinitely large but distinct from one another. Cantor wrote little of a philosophical nature, but his startling achievements in fundamental investigations of mathematics stimulated the deeper enquiry into the epistemological foundations of mathematics which had a profound influence on Western thought during the first three decades of the twentieth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf prosperous and cultured Danish-born parents, Cantor&#8217;s talent for mathematics was observed  when he was only 14 and by the age of 18 he was studying under the great mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker, and by 1867 had published a doctoral thesis on one of Gauss&#8217;s famous unsolved problems. Cantor then joined the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a series of papers published from 1869 to 1873, Cantor dealt with the theory of numbers, trigonometric series - in which he extended the concept of real numbers, Riemann&#8217;s complex numbers, and a new definition of irrational numbers in terms of convergent sequences of rational numbers. Following an exchange of letters with Dedekind, he then began the work for which he is famous: Set Theory and the concept of transfinite numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1873, Cantor used the idea of one-to-one correspondence to show that the rational numbers (i.e. fractions), though infinite in number, are <em>countable</em> because they may be arranged in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural (whole) numbers, but, contrariwise, the set of real numbers (i.e. including numbers with infinitely many decimal digits) was <em>uncountable</em>. Even more paradoxically, he proved that the set of all algebraic numbers (such as the square root of 2 and so on) are as numerous as the natural numbers, but transcendental numbers (such as pi), which are a <em>subset</em> of the real numbers, are <em>uncountable</em> and therefore more numerous than the natural numbers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe results were so startling that at first Kronecker refused to publish it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCantor&#8217;s theory quickly became controversial, leading to the study of a whole sequence of &#8220;transfinite numbers&#8221; each larger than the one before. Cantor held that these transfinite numbers had an <em>actual existence</em>, drawing on his early religious training to justify the assertion. Kronecker, on the other hand, famously remarked that only the integers &#8216;exist&#8217;  &#8211; &#8220;God made the integers, and all the rest is the work of man&#8221; &#8211; and blocked Cantor&#8217;s appointment to the University of Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCantor continued work despite bouts of mental illness. Partly because of his experience with Kronecker, he often supported young, aspiring mathematicians. At the turn of the century, his work was fully recognised as fundamental to the development of function theory, analysis and topology. Moreover, his work stimulated further development of both the intuitionist (<a href=\"../../people/b/r.htm#bruuwer-luitzen\">Brouwer</a>) and the formalist (<a href=\"../../people/h/i.htm#hilbert-david\">Hilbert</a>) schools of thought in the logical foundations of mathematics.</p>\r\n\r\n"

However,\r\nin later life, the positions he took on political and economic affairs seemed\r\nmore in line with the Tories.</p>\r\n<p>Carlyle is renowned for his passionate, preacher-like opposition to\r\nindustrial society that was emerging in Britain, captured in his <i>Chartism</i>\r\n(1840) and, especially, <i>Past and Present</i> (1843), a book much admired by Engels. Carlyle was not an economist or even a scholar, but more like an Old Testament prophet. His utter disdain for economists and economics is well known &#8211; it was he who characterized it as &#8220;the dismal science.&#8221; In his view, it was the economists and their theories which\r\nserved as the apologistic ideological and religious buttress of the industrial\r\nrevolution that, in his view, was destroying Britain. At one point, he\r\nrecommended that economists ought to be &#8220;popularly elected&#8221; as a way\r\nto make them accountable to the population that their theories were helping\r\nruin. Nonetheless, he was, at least for a time, a friend of John Stuart Mill.\r\nHe was also a close friend of John Ruskin.</p>\r\n<p>Thomas Carlyle was a &#8220;feudalist&#8221; (if such a term can be allowed).\r\nBut he does not pine for old-fashioned reactionary aristocracy or pastoral\r\nromance. Rather, Carlyle absorbed Goethe&#8217;s ideas on the &#8220;natural,&#8221; \r\nin particular the relationship between external order and\r\npersonal freedom. He conceived that the end of human activity is activity itself\r\n&#8211; the Protestant ethic, secularly enhanced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor Carlyle, the feudal system&#8217;s <i>sole</i> value is that it is much better at\r\nassigning a man an activity and thereafter granting him the freedom to pursue it in any manner he pleases. In contrast, a market system assigns\r\nhim no activity, but simultaneously becomes the hardest taskmaster of all by forcing him to &#8220;serve it&#8221; by chasing wage labor, profit, etc. He\r\nsees a market society as &#8220;unnatural&#8221; as it forces people to pursue\r\nconsumption and accumulation, whereas, in Carlyle&#8217;s view, people&#8217;s nature is to pursue activity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus, for Carlyle, the feudal system may be harsh in limiting social mobility, but it offers freedom of activity at the individual level and the joy of craftsmanship.\r\nIn contrast, the market system is socially much more progressive, but at the individual level, it forces everybody into the unnatural activities of gain and acquisition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCarlyle&#8217;s darkest moment was the publication of his infamous defense of slavery\r\n(in his 1849 <i>Fraser&#8217;s Magazine</i>) and his shamelessly racist and venomous <i>Latter-Day Pamphlets</i> (1850). </p>\r\n<p>Carlyle saw little difference between a black slave in a slave society and a joyous yeoman in a feudal society&#8211; except that one is loyally bound to his task by\r\nchains and whips, and the other by tradition and custom. In either case, the &#8220;joy of work&#8221; is (eventually) achieved.</p>\r\n<p>It was his attacks on the Evangelical Christian abolitionism\r\nand charity which were the main sore point with Victorian society.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut neither a feudal society nor a slave society are being &#8220;recommended&#8221; by Carlyle. His early interest in Saint-Simonism, which embraced industrial society (but tried to rationalize it) proves that he was not a traditional feudalist. The main issue was the &#8220;man-must-work&#8221; principle of Saint-Simon and Goethe. How this can be achieved in an industrial society, he did not know nor did he have practical policy suggestions for. He was a man of letters. He wrote to shock.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He contributed to logic, the analysis of language, the theory of probability and the philosophy of science; typical of the third stage of positivism, &#8220;Neo-Positivism&#8221;, Carnap&#8217;s method is a kind of systematic reductionism, in which language and concepts are seen as a hierarchy of &#8220;short-hands&#8221;, at the end of which are individual sensuous impressions &#8211; a fairly shallow attempt to justify the place of mathematical logic in a broader domain than it is usually found useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCarnap studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Jena where he attended <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#frege-gottlob\">Gottlob Frege</a>&#8217;s lectures, which exerted a deep influence on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter serving in World War I, Carnap did his PhD at Jena on the concept of space, which he held to conflate several quite distinct meanings: formal space, physical space, and intuitive space. Subsequently, his work centred on symbolic logic and the foundations of physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1926 <a href=\"../../people/s/c.htm#schlick-moritz\">Moritz Schlick</a>, the founder of the Vienna Circle, invited Carnap to join the University of Vienna, where he soon became an influential member of the Circle. Out of their discussions developed the initial ideas of Logical Positivism, or Logical Empiricism. This school shared its basic Empiricist and sceptical orientation with <a href=\"../../people/h/u.htm#hume-david\">David Hume</a> and <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst\">Ernst Mach</a>. Carnap brought to this group the techniques of Frege&#8217;s symbolic logic which he held to be superior to the discursive methods of traditional logic. Carnap also formed an assocation with Hans Reichenbach in Berlin, and together they published the  periodical, <em>Erkenntnis</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor Carnap, the problem of knowledge reduced to a logical analysis of the evidential basis for statements about the world on the basis of immediately given sense-data. No thought was given to the active character of sensuousness or the problem of the origin of the categories through which the data of the senses may be comprehended, and Carnap regarded logic and mathematics to be subject to <em>a priori</em> verification, since they did not rely on empirical observation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn his philosophical work, <span class=\"book\">The Logical Structure of the World: Pseudoproblems in Philosophy</span> published in 1928, Carnap developed a reductive schema through which all terms suited to describe empirical facts are <em>definable</em> in terms referring exclusively to elements of immediate experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnder pressure of critique by his Vienna Circle colleagues, Carnap modified his schema to utilise the concept of  &#8220;Reduction Sentences&#8221; &#8211; much-refined versions of <a href=\"../../terms/o/p.htm#operationalism\">operational</a> definitions, and &#8220;Observation Sentences&#8221; &#8211; whose truth can be checked by direct observation. He presented his new position in the essay <span class=\"book\">Testability and Meaning</span> in 1937. Carnap now argued that the <em>terms</em> of empirical science are not fully definable in purely experiential terms, but that <em>statements</em> that cannot be tested by observational findings were meaningless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the time <span class=\"book\">Testability and Meaning</span> appeared, Carnap had moved to the University of Chicago to escape the Nazi invasion. During 1940-41, Carnap was a visiting professor at Harvard University and an active participant in a discussion group that included Bertrand Russell, Alfred Tarski, and <a href=\"../../people/q/u.htm#quine-willard\">Willard Quine</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCarnap spent his last years at Princeton, where worked on probability theory, and continued to modify his system of inductive logic.

Castro publicly supported the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Supported Gorbachev&#8217;s glasnost policy and &#8216;new thinking&#8217; in international policy. In the 1990s, facing extreme economic disaster due to the fall of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Castro allowed Western capitalists to conduct limited business in Cuba so that Cuba could survive, still under economic, military, and political embargo from the most powerful nation in the world. Castro never renounced his internationalist socialist ideology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <strong><a href=\"../../../history/cuba/archive/castro/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Fidel Castro Archive</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\n<p>\nItalian revolutionist, one of the founders of <em>Lotta Comunista.</em> A. Cervetto was born in Buenos Aires on April 16th, 1927, son of Italian immigrants. \n</p><p>\nAs a young worker at the llva factory of Savona, after the political-military crisis of Fascism of September 8th, 1943, Cervetto joined the civil war against nazi-fascism, deserving the &#8220;Croce al Merito&#8221;.\n</p><p>\nFor five years, since this partisan experience, through  his rejection of Stalinism and  of Togliatti&#8217;s &#8216;svolta di Salerno&#8217; (&#8220;Salerno turn&#8221;), through the struggle against &#8220;anarchist nothingness&#8221;, Cervetto studied Marxism thoroughly. \n</p><p>\nIn March, 1950, Cervetto took part in the first congress, organised in Genoa-Pontedecimo by an anarchist group with the purpose of reorganising FAI (Italian Anarchical Federation). FAI was not a purely &#8220;anarchic organisation&#8221;, actually it gathered different anti-Stalinist wings, and the Leninist wing (to which Cervetto belonged) as well. \n</p><p>\nA long season of political and theoretical struggle was at this point beginning for Cervetto. At first it was carried out by his contribution to newspapers such as <em>Il Libertario</em> (The Libertarian) of Milan&#8212;where, from May 1950 to May 1951,  21 articles of Cervetto appeared, dealing with the subjects of the &#8216;cold war&#8217; and the &#8216;decolonisation&#8217;, later collected in the book &#8220;L&#8217;imperialismo unitario&#8221;&#8212;(Unitary Imperialism) and <em>L'Impulso</em> (The Impulse) (1950-57).\n</p><p>\nCervetto&#8217;s political and trade union activity was never separated from his effort to develop a core of revolutionary workers united by the principle of theoretical homogeneity as &#8216;necessary precondition for the building of the workers party in Italy&#8217;. \n</p><p>\nAn intense reorganizational activity took place in 1950 and 1951, in which Cervetto&#8217;s major contribution was related to the theoretical struggle. FAI&#8217;s nihilist drift brought about the foundation, at the National Convention of Genoa-Pontedecimo held on February 28 and 29, 1951, of GAAP (Anarchic Groups of Proletarian Action). \n</p><p>\nDespite the purpose to reach the utmost homogeneity on principles and organization, the new group was shared by two different theoretical conceptions and two different traditions, bound to split: the Marxist-Leninist one&#8212;represented by Arrigo Cervetto&#8212;, and the Anarchical one,  represented by Pier Carlo Masini.\n</p><p>\nHere&#8217;s a passage from his contribution to the Thesis approved by the meeting: \n</p><p class=\"quoteb\">\n&#8220;There aren&#8217;t two kinds of imperialism, different in degree and nature, for the working class to choose. Imperialism does exist as a unitary manifestation of a society divided into classes and States: one single block, though shaken and agitated by tearing inner contradictions. Therefore, the only choice the world proletariat is faced with is whether to side with imperialism or with anti-imperialism&#8221;. \n</p><p>\nThe indivisible imperialism became the central theme of Cervetto&#8217;s analysis; suffice it to cite some of his articles&#8217; titles: &#8220;Imperialism is indivisible, USSR is conditioned by the USA&#8221;, &#8220;The indivisible imperialism, true aggressor in Korea&#8221;, and so on. \n</p><p>\nIn this analysis, the indivisibility of imperialism reflects itself in the inner contradictions of the two major imperialist powers, assuming the form of peripheral crises. \n</p><p>\nAt the third GAAP conference, in September 1953, Cervetto blamed, nonetheless, the tendency of some revolutionary groups to &#8216;consider imperialism as an immense machine, a great compressor&#8217;, which wouldn&#8217;t leave any space for revolutionary action. \n</p><p>\nThis view was linked with trade-union tactics. Cervetto criticized those groups of the Communist Left, heirs of Bordighism, which understood the counter-revolutionary phase as barring any union action. Since they considered trade unions as completely integrated and controlled by the &#8220;two blocks&#8221;, they ended up  rejecting any commitment of militants inside them. On the contrary, Cervetto considered intervention inside trade unions as a permanent duty of the party, even though he was fully aware that it is dependent on the capitalist cycle. \n</p><p>\nCervetto contributed  to the new series of the journal <em>Prometeo,</em> (1954, 1959 e 1960), and to <em>Azione Comunista</em> (1957-64), a paper born from a maximalist-wing of the PCI. Because of this origin of <em>Azione Comunista,</em> Cervetto paid attention not to make any concessions to maximalism and to attitudes of mere and unscientific dissention. \n</p><p>\nDuring &#8220;[our] co-operation with the newspaper [<em>Azione Comunista</em>]&#8221; Lorenzo Parodi, co-founder of Lotta Comunista, recalls &#8220;it was clear that there were two different lines: the agitational one, expressed by PCI dissidents and by those who had remained caught in the social-democratization, and the Leninist one [&#8230;] When the pragmatism without principles of the former caused a crisis of the paper, our group assumed the responsibility of transferring its publication to Genoa,  in order to give it an homogeneous line, thus anticipating the function of collective organizer of the Leninist groups which, later on, would be assumed by &#8216;Lotta Comunista&#8217;&#8221;.\n</p><p>\nThis way he arrived at the formulation of the <em>Theses of 1957</em> upon the imperialistic development, the length of the counter-revolutionary phase and the problem of building a working-class party: it was necessary, in his view, to detach the &#8220;Communist Left&#8221; from the social-imperialistic tide accelerated by the de-Stalinization. \n</p><p>\nWith these <em>Theses</em> Cervetto fought against the social-democratic turn of the former working-class parties. In November, 1957, he said: &#8220;[&#8230;] The bureaucratization of such parties [PCI and PSI] is not a degeneration of the workers&#8217; movement, it is definitely a necessity for the capitalist-system, which is trying to establish, through its political agents, its hegemony upon the workers&#8217; movement itself. It is absurd to think of competing with this particular form of organization of the capitalist hegemony&#8221;. Hence the necessity to build a revolutionary party; a process which will bring to the founding of &#8220;Lotta Comunista&#8221;. \n</p><p>\nThe revolutionary party is expressed by the objective conditions: &#171;It cannot be the fruit of pure theoretical and political will&#187;. Without these objective conditions, which develop when the proletarian masses are pressed, by a situation of deep economic crisis, to express a revolutionary movement from below, &#171;the struggle of the revolutionary party against the reformist super-structure is very limited and can obtain only quite partial results&#187;. \n</p><p>\nIn such a counter-revolutionary situation, the struggle is &#171;forcibly reduced to the recovery and formation of cadres&#187;. \n</p><p class=\"quoteb\">\n&#8220;The party&#8212;Cervetto writes&#8212;develops itself with a daily work of organization and education of the proletariat, it can&#8217;t rely upon the waves of spontaneity&#8221;. \n</p><p>\nHere was starting for Cervetto a second season of theoretical study. The themes he deals with are those of Lenin&#8217;s strategy on the role of the October Revolution as accelerator of the capitalistic development in Asia, the fight against the influence of Maoist ideology in Italy, the future role of China in inter-imperialistic struggles, Comintern&#8217;s policy on the &#8220;national and colonial&#8221; question. Some titles on these subjects are: &#8220;Lenin and the Chinese revolution&#8221; (a series of articles appeared in <em>Azione Comunista</em> in 1962 and later, in 1966, published as a pamphlet by Lotta Comunista); &#8220;The Indonesian counter-revolution&#8221;, (printed in form of articles in &#8220;Lotta Comunista&#8221; in 1966 and later published as pamphlet by Edizioni Lotta Comunista, Roma, in 1969); &#8220;The Maoist theory of the United Front&#8221; written in 1969 and published as a pamphlet in 1972.\n</p><p>\nMeanwhile he studied Lenin&#8217;s conception on political action as a scientific basis for the solution of the &#171;problems left unresolved by Bordiga&#8217;s objectivism and by Trotsky&#8217;s subjectivism&#187;, resumed in his book &#8220;Class Struggles and the Revolutionary Party&#8221;, Edizioni Lotta Comunista, Roma, 1966 (first published in a series of articles in <em>Azione Comunista</em>, 1964). Cervetto knew Bordiga and adopted his formulation of &#8220;State Capitalism&#8221; related to Soviet Russia. But he criticized the position, taken by Bordiga after WWII, about a kind of American &#8220;super-imperialism&#8221;. &#8220;It&#8217;s evident in Bordiga&#8217;s thought&#8221;, he writes in &#8220;La difficile questione dei tempi&#8221; [&#8216;The Difficult Question of Times&#8221;] &#8220;an abnormal over-evaluation of the strength of the United States, of the weakness of Europe and of the destruction of world fix capital [made during the war]&#8221;, it looks as though there were &#8220;a new form of domination, which temporarily annuls the acuteness of inter-imperialistic conflicts&#8221;. Because of this position&#8221;, so goes Cervetto&#8217;s criticism &#8220;Bordiga has retired in a sort of <em>attendismo</em>&#8221; (a position of inaction), limiting political action to &#8220;defending the program&#8221; and thus involuntarily obstructing the formation of an active revolutionary party in Italy. \n</p><p>\nWith regards to the times and duration of the counter-revolutionary period, Cervetto recalled the Asian question, the industrialization of India and China, that is, the time necessary for these countries to reach an &#8220;intermediate&#8221; level of development, leading to capital exports and their imperialistic maturation. \n</p><p>\nThe consolidation and development of the Leninist party in Italy, allowed Cervetto to begin the long and systematical ordering of his 50 years theoretical activity, in order to issue an organic edition of the main subjects of his analysis. \n</p><p>\n<em>L&#8217;imperialismo unitario</em> (Unitary Imperialism), which covers the analysis of thirty years of imperialistic development, from the 1950s to 1980, published in 1981.\n</p><p>\n<em>Il ciclo politico del capitalismo di Stato, 1950-1967</em> (The Political Cycle of State Capitalism, 1950-1967), Milan, 1989: Stalinism is considered as the supporter of this particular form of capitalistic exploitation. \n</p><p>\n<em>La contesa mondiale</em> (The Global Competition), Milan, 1990, in which the imperialistic struggles of the 1980s are understood as &#8220;a first conclusion of a war of capitals lasted fifty years&#8221;: on the Eastern front, Russia has lost while Germany has won, while on the Western front the final result is still open. \n</p><p>\n<em>La difficile questione dei tempi</em> (The Difficult Question of Times), Milan, 1990, in which Cervetto intervenes in the debate upon the times of revolution between Stalin, Trotsky and Bordiga: while it is possible to scientifically recognize the general tendency of capitalism and to foresee its inevitable outcomes, it is impossible to foresee the times of its maturity, also determined by the very presence of an active factor such as the revolutionary party.  \n</p><p>\n<em>L'ineguale sviluppo politico, 1968-1979</em> (The Uneven Political Development, 1968-1979), Milan, 1991: an analysis of the development of Italian capitalism during the 1970s and of the deep unbalance between the movements of economy and of the political over-structure. \n</p><p>\nFinally, his studies in the materialistic conception of politics, started in the middle 70s, are published in <em>L'involucro politico</em> (The Political Shell), 1994. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../c.htm\">Index of the Letter C</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

After a month, he was freed and the Communist Party sent him to study in Moscow. He returned to China in 1931 and went on to teach and write history in Peking. Around this time, he began using \"Chen Boda\" as his pseudonym.</p> \n\n<p>In 1937, he moved to Yenan where he taught in the school of party cadres and acted as Mao's political secretary until 1941. He was one of the initiators of the Yenan Rectification Movement. He also worked as a journalist, becoming director of the Chinese periodical <em>Hongqi </em> (The Red Flag). </p> \n\n<p>In 1951, he wrote a series of influential articles and a book on Mao's thought. Chen was primarily responsible for compiling the quotations that comprise  the book <em>Quotations of Chairman Mao Tse-tung</em>. In 1966, he wrote an editorial entitled \"Sweep Away All Monsters and Demons\" in <em>Renmin Ribao</em> (People's Daily). This work marked the beginning of China's <a href=\"../../events/c/u.htm\">Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution</a>. He was a key figure in the group headed by Mao's wife Jiang Qing, guiding and participating in radical social and cultural initiatives until his prominence waned in 1973. Jiang and her associates, collectively dubbed \"The Gang of Four\" were sacked by Hua Guofeng in 1976. Chen was placed on trial with them in 1981 and was ultimately sentenced to 18 years in prison.

        "content": "\nAmerican linguist and political activist who founded the system of linguistic analysis known as transformational-generative grammar; a consistent and vocal critique of U.S. foreign and domestic policy and the social role of the mass media, Chomsky&#8217;s linguistic theory has also been central in the development of modern Complexity theory. Chomsky is a Kantian in philosophy, being a defender of the idea of innate cognitive faculties.</p>\n<p>\nChomsky's interest in linguistics dates from his childhood and he went on to study linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, publishing his doctoral thesis under the title, <span class=\"book\">Transformational Analysis</span>, and by 1966 he was professor of foreign languages and linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>\n<p>\nLike <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Kant</a>, Chomsky held that experience and socialisation could not provide the fundamental rational faculty required for the interpretation of experience. At the time, in the mid-1950s, this position was against the stream, with the rising structuralist schools (see <a href=\"../j/a.htm#jakobson-roman\">Roman Jakobson</a> and <a href=\"../l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude\">Claude L&eacute;viStrauss</a>) regarding all social and linguistic forms as entirely <em>arbitrary</em>, and acquired by individuals from their socialisation within a given social structure.</p>\n<p>\nConversely, Chomsky hypothesised that human beings had an innate facility for comprehending very fundamental syntactic structures, which related to the actual syntax of any given language in much the same way that fundamental mathematical forms like topology and algebra relate to the more concrete forms in common use, such as arithmetic. Young children it is then supposed, are able to draw on an innate facility in these fundamental structures to infer the meaning and syntax of the language they hear around them. This also solves the problem that children are able to formulate grammatical rules and compose sentences that they have never heard before, and in fact are known to be able to construct sentences which adhere to grammatical forms never used by adults, but repeatedly used by young children.</p>\n<p>\nThe key concept in Chomsky&#8217;s linguistics is then the way in which increasingly concrete forms of grammar (&#8220;surface structures&#8221;) can be generated from the supposed innate structures (&#8220;generative grammars&#8221;). Conversely, analysis of language sought to disclose the underlying &#8220;deep structures&#8221;. The formal mathematical  rules by which one grammar is generated out of another Chomsky called &#8220;transformational rules.&#8221;, which he held to be basically the same in all languages, corresponding to innate, genetically transmitted mental structures in human beings.</p>\n<p>\nChomsky's claim for innate knowledge of language has never been widely accepted, but the mathematical methods he introduced for the study of linguistic structure truly changed the landscape in linguistics. The marriage of Chomsky&#8217;s structural concepts developed to cope with the infinite complexity of human language, with <a href=\"../t/u.htm#turing-alan\">Turing&#8217;s</a> algorithmic approach to the analysis of logic and computational machines, has proved fruitful in the development of the most mathematical aspects of complexity theory.</p>\n<p>\nChomsky also became well known for his opposition to the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War during the late 1960s and early '70s. In a protracted campaign against the way the War was presented on the mass media he demonstrated how the very structure of these media militated against the expression of dissenting views. His books criticising American foreign policy and the role played by big business and the mass media include <span class=\"book\">American Power and the New Mandarins</span> (1969), <span class=\"book\">On Power and Ideology</span> (1987), <span class=\"book\">Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies</span> (1989).

Comte rejected Roman Catholicism and royalism alike at an early age. He was intellectually precocious and in 1814 entered the prestigious &Eacute;cole Polytechnique and soon took up permanent residence in Paris, earning a precarious living there by the occasional teaching of mathematics and by journalism. He read widely in philosophy and history and was especially interested in those thinkers who were beginning to discern and trace some order in the history of human society. Montesquieu, Condorcet, Turgot, and Joseph de Maistre were critically worked into his own system of thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte&#8217;s most important acquaintance in Paris was <a href=\"../../people/s/a.htm#st-simon-claude\">Henri de Saint-Simon</a>, one of the founders of socialism and one of the first to see the importance of economic organisation in modern society. Comte&#8217;s ideas were very similar to Saint-Simon&#8217;s, and some of his earliest articles appeared in Saint-Simon&#8217;s publications. There were distinct differences in the two men&#8217;s viewpoints and scientific backgrounds, however, and Comte eventually broke with Saint-Simon. In 1826 Comte began a series of lectures on his &quot;system of positive philosophy&quot; for a private audience, but he soon suffered a serious nervous breakdown. He made an almost complete recovery from his symptoms the following year, and in 1828/29 he again took up his projected lecture series. This was so successfully concluded that he re-delivered it at the Royal Athenaeum. The following 12 years were devoted to his publication of his philosophy in <span class=\"book\">Course of Positive Philosophy</span> (1830-42).</p> \r\n<p>\r\nDuring the remainder of his life he was supported in part by English admirers such as <a href=\"../../people/m/i.htm#mill-john-stuart\">John Stuart Mill</a> and disciples such as lexicographer Maximilien Littr&eacute;. Comte married Caroline Massin in 1825, but the marriage was unhappy and they separated in 1842. In 1845 Comte had a profound romantic and emotional experience with Clotilde de Vaux, who died the following year of tuberculosis. Comte idealised this sentimental episode, which exerted a considerable influence on his later thought and writings, particularly with regard to the role of women in the positivist society he planned to establish.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte devoted the years after the death of Clotilde de Vaux to composing his other major work, the <span class=\"book\">System of Positive Polity</span> (1851-54), in which he completed his formulation of sociology. The entire work emphasised morality and moral progress as the central preoccupation of human knowledge and effort and gave an account of the polity, or political organisation, that this required. Comte lived to see his writings widely scrutinised throughout Europe. Many English intellectuals were influenced by him, and they translated and promulgated his work. His French devotees had also increased, and a large correspondence developed with positivist societies throughout the world. Comte died of cancer in 1857.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte was a rather sombre, ungrateful, self-centred, and egocentric personality, but his intellectual determination and humanitarian zeal attracted many followers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte lived through the aftermath of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. Modern science and technology and the Industrial Revolution had begun transforming the societies of Europe in directions no one yet understood. Comte&#8217;s particular ability was as a synthesiser of the most diverse intellectual currents. From <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hume.htm\" target=\"_top\">David Hume</a> and <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Immanuel Kant</a> he derived his conception of positivism, that positive knowledge is based on natural phenomena and their properties and relations as verified by the empirical sciences. From various French clericalist thinkers Comte took the notion of social organisation that would imitate the hierarchy and discipline of the Catholic church. From various Enlightenment philosophers he adopted the notion of historical progress. From Saint-Simon he drew the need for a basic and unifying &quot;sociology&quot; to explain existing social organisations and guide social planning for a better future.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte&#8217;s &quot;law of the three stages&quot; maintained that human intellectual development had moved historically from a theological stage, a transitional metaphysical stage, in which explanations were in terms of essences, final causes, and other abstractions; and finally to the modern positive stage, distinguished by an awareness of the limitations of human knowledge. Knowledge, he held, could only be relative to man&#8217;s nature as a species and to his social and historical situation. Absolute explanations were therefore better abandoned for the more sensible discovery of laws based on the observable relations between phenomena.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte classified the sciences according to an historical sequence from mathematics, astronomy, physics, and chemistry to biology and finally to sociology. According to Comte, sociology would reduce social facts to laws and synthesise the whole of human knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe held that the underlying principles of society are individual egoism, encouraged by the division of labour, and the combination of efforts and the maintenance of social cohesion by means of government and the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nComte rejected democracy, emphasising hierarchy and obedience, and he held that the ideal government would be made up of an intellectual elite. His ideas influenced, among others, <a href=\"../../people/d/u.htm#durkheim-emile\">&Eacute;mile Durkheim</a> and <a href=\"../../people/s/p.htm#spencer-herbert\">Herbert Spencer</a>.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/comte/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Auguste Comte Archive</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In 1765, Condorcet published his first work on mathematics.  In 1769, he was elected to the prestigious Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise.  From 1773, he was appointed secretary of the Acad&eacute;me, and formed close relations with Voltaire, Diderot and Jacques Turgot. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nCondorcet sought to explain socio-economic phenomona by mathematical and statistical methods.  Condorcet argued that the only social obligation is to obey the requirements of Reason, rather than the general Will, as proposed by Rousseau. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nCondorcet was an optimist on social progress, believing in the ultimate &#8220;perfectability&#8221; of man. He is often credited as the first to formulate the idea of a welfare state, which redistributed wealth in order to eliminate poverty. Condorcet&#8217;s research programme was abandoned wholesale after the French Revolution &#8211; particularly after J.B. Say&#8217;s efforts to redirect French theory towards non-mathematical British political economy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCondorcet was appointed by Turgot as master of the mint in 1774.  He resigned in protest in 1776 over Turgot&#8217;s dismissal, but went on to serve until 1791. During this time, Condorcet wrote his famous theorem proving that majority voting could not produce consistent results in deciding between more than two alternatives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCondorcet took a leading role in the 1789 French Revolution, which he saw as embodying a great hope for his &#8220;rationalist&#8221; reconstruction of society.  However, he voted against the execution of the Louis XVI and opposed the arrest of the Girodins.  As a result, Condorcet was denounced as a traitor by the Jacobins and went into hiding in 1791.  It was during this period that he wrote his great humanitarian tract on the Progress of the Human Spirit (1795).   Finally captured in 1794, he reportedly took his own life in prison, although the possibility that he was murdered cannot be ruled out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Copernicus was familiar with the writings of the ancient Atomists who had postulated \"heliocentrism\" against the Geocentrism of Aristotle, Plato and Ptolemy and adopted as dogma by the Church. The Church condemned Copernicus&#8217;s work and progressive thinkers of the time took them up and further developed them. Copernicus thus marks the beginning of materialism in this era. The leap made by Copernicus arose out of the accumulation of astronomical observations which required continual amendment of the Ptolemic model, introducing ever more \"spheres\" to account for observed trajectories. Copernicus proposed a model which provided a much more \"plausible\" explanation for the observations, if only one could lay aside the doctrine of Geocentrism.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../c.htm\">Index of the Letter C</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n"

As leader of the Women&#8217;s Peace Crusade of 1916-17, Helen Crawfurd was also a vociferous anti-war and anti-conscription campaigner. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHelen Crawfurd-Anderson was born on November 9th 1877, in the Gorbals District of Glasgow, the daughter of a master baker. He was President of the Operative Bakers&#8217; Association, a Conservative Party member and a Presbyterian. Helen had two sisters and three brothers. Her parents moved to Ipswich, in Suffolk, England during her childhood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the Docklands, she began to listen to the Socialist propagandists at open-air meetings, was impressed by their arguments, and soon entered the suffragette movement, feeling &#8220;that if the Mothers of the race had some say, then things would be changed.&#8221; Thus began a lifetime of devoted service to the working class movement. From around 1900, she joined the WSPU and became an outstanding fighter for the right of British women to vote. She was sent to prison three times for her activities in the suffragette movement, and spent a month in Holloway Prison in 1912 for breaking windows and was imprisoned for one month for making inflammatory comments in Perth but released after a five day hunger strike). She was also conditionally released from prison in Glasgow&#8217;s Duke Street Prison from a one month sentence for smashing windows of the army recruiting offices, only after an eight-day hunger strike. After her release a bomb exploded at Glasgow&#8217;s Botanic Gardens and Helen was implicated and was sent back to prison, only to be released after another hunger strike.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe took a fearless stand in opposition to the Imperialist War of 1914-18. In June 1916, she initiated, and became Secretary of the Women&#8217;s Peace Crusade. Also involved were her good friends Mary Barbour and Agnes Dollan. She was twice arrested for her anti-war work, appearing in the dock with William Gallacher and other Socialist leaders. Helen was also active with Mary Barbour, Agnes Dollan, Jessie Stephens and other women in the Glasgow rent strikes against profiteering Landlords that resulted in the &#8216;Rent Restriction Act&#8217; of 1915.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe was a member of the British delegation to the Conference of the Women&#8217;s International League at Zurich in 1919. This delegation included all the foremost women representatives of the British working class movement of that time&#8212;Mrs. Snowden, Madame Despard, Ellen Wilkinson, Mrs. Pethick- Lawrence and others. This delegation chose Helen Crawfurd Anderson to make the report to the Conference on their behalf. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the 1914-18 war she had joined the Independent Labour Party, and became Vice-President of that organisation in 1918, and one of its principal propagandists, travelling throughout Scotland and many other parts of Britain to address meetings. She became disillusioned with the ILP and in 1920 established an unofficial grouping within the ILP, known as &#8216;Left Wing Committee&#8217;, with a journal the <em>International</em>. This grouping, which included Emile Burns, R. Palme Dutt, E. H. Brown, Shapurji Saklatvala, J. R. Wilson and J. Walton Newbold, joined the Communist Party.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe had welcomed the victory of the Russian Revolution in 1917, and visited Russia in 1920, as an ILP delegate to the second congress of the Third International. There she had an interview with Lenin, which was to help chart the future course of her participation in the movement. To the end of her life she was filled with unbounded admiration for the Bolsheviks.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn her return from Russia in 1920 she became Secretary (in 1921) of the Workers International Relief Organisation (WIR). She raised money for the famine-stricken people of the Volga region and carried out relief work in Germany, addressing a meeting of 10,000 in Berlin in 1924 on behalf of the German Communist Party (KPD) and in all the mining districts of Britain during the lockout, which followed the General Strike of 1926. She succeeded in extending the relief work to the famine-stricken West of Ireland and to the Scottish Highlands during periods of depression. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1921 she joined the newly-formed Communist Party, becoming a central committee member, setting up the Women&#8217;s Department of the Communist Party in January 1922 and editing the women&#8217;s page of <em>Communist</em>, the Party&#8217;s journal. Helen Crawfurd, in her Communist Party election address for the Govan ward, Glasgow City Council in 1921, stressed her commitment to improving the political and economic status of women. This is one of the earliest examples of a political candidate in Britain making gender into a political issue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the eve of the Second World War in 1939, she organised a Peace Congress of representatives from countries with the British Empire. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe was to remain an illustrious member of the Communist Party right to the end of her life. Helen Crawfurd Anderson died on 18th April 1954, in her 77th year. Sadly, her autobiography remains unpublished.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">by Graham Stevenson</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Having joined the Communist Party in 1931 at the university, his final graduation thesis was presented under ubnder guard by the political police of the fascist Salazar regime. </p>\r\n<p>In 1936 he was elected for the Central Committee of a party that was struggling to organize in very hard clandestine conditions (which lasted 48 years). He took a very relevant part in the reorganization of 1940, which built the foundations of a Leninist party. In 1937 and 1940, he was imprisoned and was tortured during both these periods. In 1948, he was again imprisoned and sentenced to 11 years prison. The first 8 years &#8211; in the Lisbon penitentiary &#8211; were passed in absolute solitary confinement. His defense in court, which he turned into a remarkable political accusation of the fascist regime, was prepared without any possibility of taking notes. Transferred to the fortress of Peniche, he escaped in January 1960 along with 10 other communist cadres. </p>\r\n<p>Since the death in 1948 of Bento Gonçalves in the Tarrafal concentration camp, the Party did not, for 23 years, have a secretary-general. Álvaro Cunhal was elected in 1961.</p>\r\n<p>In the same year, the Central Committee decided that it was necessary for his protection (if he was arrested he would certainly be murdered) to leave the country. He resided in the USSR until 1969, and after that went to Paris. His presence in the exterior created new conditions for the reinforcement of the international solidarity with the Portuguese anti-fascist resistance and of the ties between the clandestine Portuguese Communist Party with the international communist movement, in which Cunhal became a very prominent personality.   </p>\r\n<p>Days after the 25th of April 1974 revolution he returned to Portugal. He was a minister without portfolio in the first four Provisional Governments, until 1975. These governments approved social, political and economic measures of very large democratic scope which were in its majority reversed after the right-wing coup of November 1975. </p>\r\n<p>The Portuguese Communist Party, under his leadership, directed for decades the resistance to this counter-revolutionary threat.</p>\r\n<p>He remained Secretary-General of the party until 1992, and a member of the Central Committee until his death.</p>\r\n<p>Cunhal was a very multifaceted personality. Besides his very extensive political and theoretical work, some of which was translated all over the world, he was a draughtsman and a painter, and wrote literary fiction.

At the first news of the approach of enemy forces Danton undertook the or-ganization and leadership of the defence of revolutionary France. In 1793 on Danton&#8217;s initiative the revolutionary tribunal was created which launched the Reign of Terror. In December 1793, considering the conquests of the revolution to be sufficiently re-inforced, Danton began to speak out for the need to terminate the Reign of Terror. &#8216;I propose,&#8217; he said, &#8216;not to trust whoever might wish to lead the people beyond the bounds of the revolution and to propose ultra.revolutionary measures&#8217;. From then on Danton came out openly and firmly against the supporters of the Terror, the representatives of the most democratic layers, Chaumette and H&#232;bert, and helped Robespierre punish them. But he himself aroused the suspicions of Robespierre who found the line of the the Dantonists not revolutionary enough.

Both conceptions are justified within certain limits, but the one is as one-sided and narrowminded as the other.  The interaction of bodies in nature &#8211; inanimate as well as animate &#8211; includes both harmony and collision, struggle and cooperation.  When therefore a self-styled natural scientist takes the liberty of reducing the whole of historical development with all its wealth and variety to the one-sided and meager phrase \"struggle for existence\", a phrase which even in the sphere of nature can be accepted only <em> cum grano salis </em>, such a procedure really contains its own condemnation.  <span class=\" context \"> [ ....] </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\nFredrick Engels<br />\r\n<a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1875/letters/75_11_17-ab.htm\" target=\"_top\">Engels to P.

Her father, a graduate of St. Augustine's College, a traditional black college in Raleigh, North Carolina, was briefly a high school history teacher. Leaving teaching due to the low salary, he owned and operated a service station in the black section of Birmingham. Her mother, also college educated, was an elementary school teacher with a history of political activism. Using their modest income, the family purchased a large home in a mixed neighborhood where Angela spent most of her youth. The neighborhood, called locally &#8220;Dynamite Hill,&#8221; was marked by racial conflict. She was occasionally able to spend time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring her childhood, Angela experienced the humiliations of racial segregation. She was bright and begged to enter school early, attending Carrie A. Tuggle School, a Black elementary school in dilapidated facilities and later Parker Annex, a similarly dilapidated annex of Parker High School devoted to middle school education. Angela read voraciously. By her junior year, at 14, she applied for and was accepted to a program of the American Friends Service Committee which placed Black students from the South in integrated schools in the north. She chose to attend high school at Elizabeth Irwin High School, also known as the Little Red School House, in Greenwich Village in New York City a small private school favored by the radical community. There Angela was exposed to study of socialism and communism and recruited to the Communist youth group, Advance, where she became acquainted with children of the leaders of the Communist Party including her lifelong friend, Bettina Aptheker.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1970, Davis became the third woman to appear on the FBI's Most Wanted List when she was charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and homicide, due to her alleged participation in an escape attempt from Marin County Hall of Justice. It was alleged that she had helped Johnathan Jackson, younger brother of prison inmate and cause célèbre, George Jackson, plan a kidnapping in order to secure the release of the elder Jackson. The kidnapping plan went awry, resulting in the deaths of judge Harold Haley, prisoners William Christmas and James McClain, and Jonathan Jackson. The shotgun that killed Haley had been registered in her name. It was alleged by the prosecution that she provided some of the firearms and participated in the planning of the kidnapping. She evaded the police for two months before being captured. She was tried and acquitted of all charges eighteen months after her capture.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of Angela Davis&#8217;s central concerns is the fight to go beyond &#8220;prison reform,&#8221; by developing radical \r\nalternatives to prison and by combating the private corporations profiteering out of the &#8220;correctional&#8221; industry.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Debord saw himself as the leader of the SI, which never counted more than a dozen or so Parisian intellectuals as members.</p>\r\n<p>The SI held that capitalism diverted and stifled creativity, dividing the social body into producers and consumers, or actors and spectators. By 1962 they were applying their critique to all aspects of capitalist society, and no longer limiting it to arts and culture. Though inspired anarchism, their position was similar to that of &#8220;council communism.&#8221; They saw the USSR as a capitalist bureaucracy. </p>\r\n<p>In 1967, Debord published his major work, <i>Society of the Spectacle</i>, arguing that the &#8220;spectacle,&#8221; or the domination of life by images, has subsumed all other forms of domination. He sees <i>commodity</i> production, as central to the of Situationist theory, including the creation of &#8220;pseudo-needs&#8221; by capitalism, and thus tended to shift criticism of capitalism from production to distribution and consumption. <i>Society of the Spectacle</i> had an great influence on the student rebellion in 1968. </p>\r\n<p>The Situationist praxis was based on constructing situations that were disruptive to social norms to redirect images and events. To undermine consumer society and the constructed spectacle they encouraged vandalism, wildcat strikes and sabotage, seeing these as creative acts. The group disbanded over tactical disputes in 1972. </p>\r\n<p>In 1984, Debord&#8217;s friend and publisher, Gerard Lebovici was assassinated, and Debord was implicated. He won the subsequent libel suits, and in 1985 published <i>Considerations on the Assassination of Gerard Lebovici</i>.

De Leon participated in the founding of the IWW in the USA in 1905. The SLP described itself with the metaphor of a 'beacon', the light from which workers would see when the moment for revolution arrived. De Leon described the aim of the ASL to be elected as a 'shield' to neutralise the power of the state, with the One Big Union (OBU) as the 'sword' to take and hold the means of production and administer the economy of a future socialist society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As editor of <em>The People,</em> from 1892 until his untimely death, De Leon developed the strategy and tactics needed to establish socialism by civilized, but nonetheless revolutionary, means in highly industrialized countries like the United States&#8212;the Socialist Industrial Union program of the Socialist Labor Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That program, which also provides an outline of a democratic structure on which genuine socialism will be built, was not the work of a chair-bound intellectual or theorist.

The Thirty Years War, which engulfed almost the whole of Europe, began when Descartes was 22 years of age. The Roman Inquisition burned the astronomer Giodarno Bruno in 1600 and declared Copernicus and Galileo heretics in 1616 and 1632 respectively. A Republic existed in the Netherlands until 1648 and Charles I of England was deheaded by Oliver Cromwell in 1649. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese were dangerous times for thinkers. The Reformation and the Renaissance had certainly changed the landscape, but anyone who raised doctrinal questions in those days needed, and probably had, an army to make their point. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nArmies were Descartes' &#8220;hobby&#8221; in fact, he would travel leagues to watch a military parade, but he was realistic, and travelled continuously, kept the lowest possible profile and spoke of his investigations only to close friends. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was almost no natural science in Descartes' day. Brecht's famous play, <span class=\"book\">Galileo</span>, gives an idea of the intellectual environment: when the Inquisitor looks down Galileo's telescope he sees &#8220;nothing&quot;. One could suspect that the saying: &#8220;curiosity killed the cat&#8221; dates from this period. When Galileo was forced to repent in 1632, Descartes destroyed the manuscript of his first work <span class=\"book\">Cosmos.</span> </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/descarte.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Discourse on Method</span></a> was first published anonymously in Leiden, Holland in 1637. Descartes' friend, Mersenne, had publicly announced Descartes' authorship, and Descartes was forced to admit to being author of <span class=\"book\">The Discourse</span>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<span class=\"book\">The Discourse</span> was written in his native French &#8220;in the hope that those who avail themselves of their natural reason alone, may be better judges of my opinions than those who give heed only to the writings of the &#8220;ancients&quot;. And that was how debate over &#8220;scientific&#8221; questions was conducted in those days: one scripture was compared or contrasted with another, but never (apart from within the privileged confines of mathematics) was Reason or observation accepted as evidence. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was with very good reason that Descartes held that there was nothing of the body of knowledge of the society of his day that he could affirm with <em>any</em> degree of confidence. &#8220;Knowledge&#8221; was dominated by myth, prejudice, doctrine, double-talk and above all Religion, backed by the threat of execution and torture. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is therefore commonly suspected that Descartes's supposed proof of the existence of God could be seen as a transparent ploy to avoid declaration as a heretic. Likewise, his moral maxim of &#8220;adhering constantly to the religion in which God's grace I had been instructed since my childhood, ... etc.&quot;. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the other hand, it worth noting that Descartes did not just &#8220;philosophise&#8221; about the capacity of the mind to accurately reflect the properties of space, time and matter: his discovery, Cartesian Geometry, is fundamental to every branch of science to this very day, establishing a correspondence between algebraic formulae and spatial forms which must astound every person who is newly introduced to its marvel. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDescartes also investigated optics (his vortex notion of light particles in some ways prefigured the modern wave-particle theory), physiology (reflex actions) and cosmology (formation of the heavenly bodies from vortices of matter). </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrancis Bacon and Galileo were Descartes' predecessors in the search for scientific truth. Both were advocates of experimentation and observation of Nature and both advised that mechanics offered the best first step in building up a knowledge of Nature, Galileo making epoch-making discoveries in this domain. But Descartes craved after certainty, and that was, it appeared, nowhere to be found, only guesswork, speculation, approximate truth, possibility and sheer outright and obvious untruth. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLike most of the thinkers of the epoch, Descartes aspired to the kind of precision and certainty that Mathematics alone had achieved. While the simplest forms of geometrical measure and mechanical movement appeared amenable to mathematical precision, the whole rich Universe of natural, social and spiritual phenomena was totally out of reach of such analysis. Apart from the opinions of tradespeople, theoretical explanation of Nature was dominated mostly by superstition and baseless dogma. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> (Related material:) Ilyenkov's <a href=\"../../../archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essay1.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Essays from the History of Dialectics</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With his knowledge of psychology and the grasp of the \r\nproblems of knowledge gained from his study of Hegel, Dewey was in a unique \r\nposition to develop an activity approach towards <em>Progressive \r\nEducation</em>, emphasising the development of individuality and\r\ninitiative in children, in opposition to the conservative traditions of education which \r\nemphasised the inculcation of learning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTaking up a position as Professor of Philosophy and Chairman of the \r\nDepartment of Philosophy, Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of \r\nChicago in 1894, Dewey began to develop his <em>Instrumentalist</em>\r\ntheory of knowledge. After the joint publication of a series of essays, <span \r\nclass=\"book\">Studies in Logical Theory</span>, the group he had\r\ngathered around him became known as the Chicago School. In 1904, Dewey became \r\nProfessor of Philosophy at Columbia University and was associated with \r\nColumbia for the rest of his life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough the impact of his Hegel studies is clearly visible in Dewey's \r\nemphasis on the active role of the subject in knowledge, his holistic \r\napproach to questions, and in his developmental approach to social \r\nquestions, he soon found Hegel's idealistic system unsatisfactory and \r\nrejected it in favour of the developmental theories of evolutionary biology \r\nand psychology. Dewey was one of the first to define man as a \r\n&#8220;tool-making animal&#8221;. According to his Instrumentalism, ideas\r\nand words are &#8220;tools&#8221; which people use to grasp a situation or\r\nevent. The psychic and the physical then, are just differents aspects within the \r\nevent or the situation. Along with his Hegelianism, Dewey rejected all \r\nbelief in meaning and objectivity at the social and historical level. Laying \r\na heavy emphasis on individuality, he regarded meaning as something which is \r\ncreated by the individual in their immediately given situation. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his psychological research, worked out in close association with William \r\nJames, Dewey arrived at the Functional approach which was to become dominant \r\nin sociology with the work of <a href=\"../p/a.htm#parsons-talcott\">Talcott \r\nParson</a>, the founder of Functional Sociology. Functional psychology \r\ntreats the individual and their situation together as a single \r\n&#8220;organism&#8221;, and studies the processes of mutual interaction\r\nand mutual reinforcement between them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was the Progressive Education movement that gave Dewey's ideas their most \r\nwidespread and popular application however. Progressive Education stressed \r\nactive enquiry, practical work and problem-solving on the part of the \r\nstudent, rather than emphasising curriculum and structured instruction by a \r\nteacher.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDewey's most comprehensive presentation of his views was published in 1925 \r\nas <span class=\"book\">Experience and Nature</span>.

Dilthey argued for methods in the human sciences distinctly different from that of the natural sciences, and that Psychology should be the foundational science for all the human sciences.</p>\n<p>Dilthey objected to the pervasive influence of the natural sciences and developed a philosophy of life emphasising historical contingency. His &#8216;Philosophy of Life&#8217; drew on Hegel&#8217;s <em>Geist</em> and pivoted on the notion of a living spirit which develops in historical forms. Dilthey was little known during his own lifetime, being rediscovered in post-World War One Germany, and is now widely recognised in cultural studies.</p>\n<p>Dilthey was the son of a Reformed Church theologian, but after studying theology at Heidelberg and Berlin, he transferred to philosophy and after completing his Doctorate at Berlin and a short time as a school teacher, dedicated himself full-time to writing, and after appointments as Basel and Breslau, took up the position as Chair of Philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he spent the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p>Dilthey&#8217;s aim was to find the philosophical foundations for what he called the &#8220;sciences of man, of society, and the state,&#8221; which he named <em>Geisteswissenschaften</em>, usually translated as &#8220;human sciences&#8221; - a term that eventually gained general recognition to collectively denote the fields of history, philosophy, religion, psychology, art, literature, law, politics and economics. </p>\n<p>In 1883, the first volume of his &#8220;<a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/dilthey.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Introduction to Human Sciences</span></a>&#8221; appeared but the second volume never appeared, only a series of essays including in 1894, &#8220;Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytical Psychology.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Against the dominant conception of his time, Dilthey opposed the idea that the human sciences should emulate the methodology of the natural sciences, and tried to establish the humanities as sciences in their own right. In his study of interpersonal experience, its realisation in creative expression, the reflective understanding of this experience, and the &#8220;logical development&#8221; that may be attributed to the development of knowledge and culture in social and historical processes, Dilthey developed important insights. He developed his &#8220;descriptive psychology,&#8221; mainly through the study of literature, and said of the psychology of his times: &#8220;Contemporary psychology is an expanded doctrine of sensation and association. The fundamental power of mental life falls outside the scope of psychology. Psychology has become only a doctrine of the forms of psychic processes, thus it grasps only a part of that which we actually experience as mental life.&#8221; Psychology needed to be based on an analysis of mental processes in real-life situations, rather than in a laboratory. Dilthey emphasised that the essence of human beings <em>cannot</em> be grasped by <em>introspection</em> but only from a knowledge of history; knowledge could never be final, because history is never final. Dilthey thus suggested, for the first time, a Cultural Psychology,</p>\n<p>Dilthey held that the <em>historical</em> relativity of all ideas and institutions is the most characteristic and challenging fact in the intellectual life of the modern world. He was hostile to the construction of closed, rational systems and preferred to leave questions unsettled. This preference for leaving questions open, was perhaps the main contributing factor to his failure to be recognised in his own time. Only after the War, did the significance of the methodology of his historical philosophy of life come to be appreciated. Dilthey supervised Mead&#8217;s PhD studies.</p>\n\n\n"

Imprisoned for sedation in 1918 after continual protest of the world war, shortly after his release he moved to the Soviet Union.  By 1921 he was elected to the executive committee of the Comintern (Third International). Two years later he moved back to Bulgaria where he led a worker's revolt that was brutally crushed by the capitalist government. Sentenced to death, Dimtrov escaped from Bulgaria, and traveled to Germany.  By 1929 in Berlin, Dimtrov was elected the head of the Central European section of the Comintern.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn February 27, 1933, the newly elected leader of the Nazi party, Adolf Hitler, convicted Dimtrov and scores of other Communists as responsible for setting fire to the German parliament building, the <a href=\"../../orgs/r/e.htm#reichstag\">Reichstag</a>.

        "content": "\r\nFor many decades, Maurice H. Dobb was recognized as the most relevant Marxist economist in western academia.</p>\r\n<p>Author of many books, papers and pamphlets, he developed both an educational role at Cambridge, where he taught almost uninterruptedly for more than 4 decades, until his retirement at the end of the academic year in 1967, and in the communist party press and educational organizations like the Labour Research Department. He published a large number of popular pamphlets on Marxism, the U.S.S.R, the economics of socialism and on capitalism development and crisis.</p>\r\n<p>In 1919, at the same moment he began his academic career, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and stayed as a loyal militant until his death. </p>\r\n<p>His book <em>Studies in the Development of Capitalism (1946</em>) remains a masterpiece in the Marxist historical tradition, and in fact it was the main contribution to the political economy perspective in the generation of studies of the new British Marxist historiography developed mainly by the communist historians of the Historians&#8217; Group (E. Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson, Raphael Samuel among others).</p>\r\n<p>Deeply convinced that Marxist economics was the logical successor to classical political economy, he tried to develop and apply Marxist economics to problems that conventional economics was unable to analyze correctly, such as imperialism or socialism. </p>\r\n<p>He joined as an assistant to Piero Sraffa in the project to publish the complete works of David Ricardo. Dobb thought that the publication in 1960 of Piero Sraffa&#8217;s book <em>The Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em> made a severe  contribution to the critique of neoclassical economics, and represented a rehabilitation of classical economics and with it, of  the Marxian theory of value.  For Dobb, &#8220;neo-Ricardianism&#8221; appeared as an academic ally of great importance in defending the academic weight of the Marxist economy. His latest book <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em> (1973) is an important inquiry into this perspective.</p>\r\n<p>As Ronald Meek said in his obituary for the Proceedings of the British Academy:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Looking at Dobb&#8217;s life and work as a whole, one is struck in particular by two things. The first is that although he was from the beginning a convinced Marxist, he always firmly resisted, in all its manifestations, the vulgar notion that Marx&#8217;s ideas constituted a kind of self-contained, encapsulated system which had had no history and was incapable of further development. On the contrary, he always insisted that there was an important sense in which Marx as an economist had worked within a broad analytical tradition established much earlier by Smith and Ricardo (a fact which suggested a ready way of introducing Marx to British audiences); that Marxian economics could and should be developed, and even where necessary transcended; and that this should be done not only with the aid of tools fashioned by Marxists, but also with the aid of at least some of those fashioned by &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; economists. (…)</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">The second thing which strikes one about Dobb&#8217;s life and work -and it is something which I think he himself would have liked to see emphasized-is the way in which throughout his whole life his political and academic activities were so closely linked together, with no loss of integrity and very little sense of strain. He always considered it part of his everyday duty, as a politically conscious academic, to make the results of his research available not only to the <em>cognoscenti</em> but also to interested lay people. And his popular books and pamphlets, whatever their level of discourse, are marked by the same meticulous scholarship, precision of argument, and refusal to make concessions to dogmatism, as his major &#8220;academic&#8221; works. The other dimension of this which should be noted is that the level of objectivity which Dobb managed to achieve in all his work was very high-quite remarkably high, in fact, if one remembers the political circumstances in which he found himself.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">(Ronald L.

        "image": "pics/durkheim.jpg",
        "content": "\r\nFrench sociologist who laid the basis for structuralist school in sociology; initially a follower of Comte&#8217;s positivism, Durkheim emphasised the need to study society as a particular kind of collective consciousness whose laws differed from the individual psyche, which develops within a social environment; emphasised population density, means of communication and collective consciousness as the chief factors in social development.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBorn into a poor Jewish family in Paris, Durkheim excelled at school and gained entry to the prestigious &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. Meeting <a href=\"../j/a.htm#jaures\">Jean Jaur&egrave;s</a> while boarding in Paris he soon abandoned his religous upbringing and developed reformist beliefs. At the &Eacute;cole Normale he earnt a reputation as an extremely able and iconoclastic student. Graduating in 1882, he took a year's leave from teaching to pursue research in Germany in 1885, where he met <a href=\"../../people/w/u.htm#wundt-wilhelm\">Wilhelm Wundt</a>, the experimental psychologist. In 1887 he was appointed to the University of Bordeaux, and taught social philosophy there until 1902, before returning to take up a position as a full professor at the University of Paris.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Durkheim was familiar with a number of different languages, he travelled little and never undertook any fieldwork, his theoretical studies being entirely based on the reports of anthropologists, travellers and missionaries.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDurkheim's mission was to overcome the broad and dogmatic generalisations which were characteristic of the founders of sociology, such as <a href=\"../../people/c/o.htm#comte-auguste\">Auguste Comte</a> and <a href=\"../../people/s/p.htm#spencer-herbert\">Herbert Spencer</a>. But further, he found the unhistorical consciousness of the exponents of the second positivism of his time like <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst\">Ernst Mach</a> quite unsuited to the solution of the problems of sociology. Durkheim held that reality is understood only by means of <em>concepts</em> which are social constructions. In his <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/durkheim.htm\" target=\"_top\">criticism of James' and Dewey's Pragmatism</a>, Durkheim dealt with how socially-held beliefs (myths), which have no practical or scientific validity in themselves, may nevertheless constitute an approach to reality, and he rejected the pragmatists&#8217; dismissal of truth as simply individual utility.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Second Empire, which collapsed after the French defeat by Germany in 1870, had seemed to Durkheim a period of levity and dissipation while he viewed the Paris Commune of 1871 as senseless destruction and evidence of the alienation of the working classes from bourgeois society. The bloody repression that followed the Commune was taken as further evidence of the ruthlessness of capitalism and of the selfishness of the bourgeoisie. The subsequent resurgence of nationalism and anti-Semitism convinced Durkheim that progress was not, as most Positivists of the time had assumed, the necessary consequence of the development of science and technology, but on the contrary, the growth of technology and mechanisation undermined society's ethical structures. Durkheim took an active role in the campaign to exonerate Dreyfus, who had been falsely jailed in a spate of anti-semitism, a step which brought considerable criticism down upon him.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDurkheim made a study of suicide, and observed that an individual who was closely integrated with his culture, was less likely to suicide, and consequently, what appeared to be the most individual of actions, could only be explained through social forces.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMore and more, Durkheim focussed on education and religion as the two most important institutions required for stability while society underwent such deep transformations. His 1915 work on the totemic system in Australia also brought him wide recognition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe death of his only son in the war in 1916, on top of denunciations by people who took him to be German, broke his heart, and he died in November 1917.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDurkheim left behind him a brilliant school of researchers including <a href=\"../../people/l/e.htm#levi-strauss-claude\">Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss</a>, who succeeded him in the chair of sociology at Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In 1939, when Harry Pollitt initially supported Britain&#8217;s entry into World War II, it was Dutt who was foremost on the central committee in arguing the line that the war should be opposed, which resulted in Pollitt&#8217;s temporary resignation as General Secretary. Dutt also differed with the Communist Party's opposition to the Warsaw Pact intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

He has published more than fifty books, including <em>Criticism and Ideology: A Study in Marxist Literary Theory</em> (1976), <em>Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism</em> (1981), <em>The Function of Criticism: From the Spectator to Post-Structuralism </em>(1984), and <em>Ideology: An Introduction</em> (1991).",
        "content": "\n<p>Eagleton was born on February 22, 1943 to an Irish Catholic family in the City of Salford, UK.  &#8220;My childhood was very influenced by Irish culture,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;My mother&#8217;s family [was] strongly Republican. I remember writing a bad Republican song at seven but I hadn&#8217;t a cat&#8217;s idea in hell what I was writing about!&#8221; (&#8220;Taking on the Capitalists&#8221; 2007).  He was educated at De La Salle College, a grammar school for boys in Salford. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he eventually went on to obtain both his M.A. and his Ph.D. at the age of 21. While completing his graduate work, Eagleton studied under the tutelage of noted Marxist theorist, Raymond Williams.  Eagleton went on to become a Fellow in English at Jesus College, Cambridge.  Since 1969, he has served as Fellow and Tutor at Wadham College, Oxford.  Eagleton was a founding member and contributing writer of <em>Slant</em>, a left-wing journal that ran from 1964 to 1970, which combined Catholic beliefs with Marxist theories.  His dialectical engagement of Marxism and Catholicism was published in <em>The New Left Church</em> (1966)<em>.  </em>As Eagleton commented during an interview more than 40 years later,</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;I certainly don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s odd that Christianity and Marxism should go together in my career, or indeed in anybody&#8217;s career. They are both concerned with emancipation, and in the narrative of each the poor play a central role. Something I am very drawn to [in both] is that their assessment of the present state of humanity is very glum, whether that is because of original sin or the class society [...] At the same time there is a feasible capacity for transformation. They see things as being much more stark and realistic than most forms of progressive liberalism. They are both tragic but, in contrast to a merely fashionable postmodern pessimism, both believe in the possibility of change.&#8221; <br />\n(&#8220;Eagleton explains&#8221; 2008) </p>\n<p>Eagleton&#8217;s interest in the political theology of the Catholic left informed much of his early writing.  </p>\n<p>From 1992 to 2001, Eagleton was Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford.  He moved on to teach at the University of Manchester, serving as John Edward Taylor Professor of English Literature from 2001 to 2008.  Eagleton is a Fellow of both the British Academy and the English Association.  He has held visiting appointments at universities such as Cornell, Duke, Iowa, Melbourne, Notre Dame, Trinity College-Dublin, and Yale.  </p>\n<p>In <em>The Function of Criticism</em>, Eagleton considers the ways in which working-class movements might create the opportunity for socialist intellectuals to become politically active within society.  He discusses how the working-class movement within the Weimer Republic &#8220;was not only a redoubtable political force; It was also equipped with its own theatres and choral societies, clubs and newspapers, recreation centres and social forums.  It was these conditions that helped to make possible a Brecht and a Benjamin, and to shift the role of critic from isolated intellectual to political functionary&#8221; (Eagleton 1984, p. 112).  </p>\n<p>Eagleton reflects on British Marxist literary criticism, and considers the major responsibility of the socialist intellectual to address &#8220;an absent, counterpublic sphere, one based upon those very institutions of popular culture and education which failed to emerge in post-war Britain&#8221; (1984, p. 112).  This objective might be achieved through &#8220;the resolute popularization of complex ideas [...] [of] works which make socialist theory intelligible to a mass audience&#8221; (Eagleton 1984, p. 113), and which provide the &#8220;collective context&#8221; necessary for organizing and sustaining socialist institutions &#8220;of literary and intellectual production&#8221; (Eagleton 1984, p. 113).  Eagleton suggests contemporary critics have been devalued because of a lack of social purpose.  It is this lack of purpose that has led to the reduction of audience, and to critical responses to the system of values and meanings used to exert political power.  </p>\n<p>Eagleton&#8217;s writings evidence his interest in the dialectical interaction between literature and ideology.  As literature reflects and represents dominant ideology, it also maintains the recessed potential for critiquing it.  In both <em>Criticism and Ideology </em>and<em> Ideology</em>: <em>An Introduction</em>, Eagleton emphasizes the paradoxical relationship between literature and ideology, as well as the often conflicting and contradictory meanings of ideology, a term that might be regarded as a &#8220;<em>text</em>, woven of a whole tissue of different conceptual strands [...] and divergent histories&#8221; (1991, p. 1 [Original emphasis]).  In <em>Ideology: An Introduction</em>, Eagleton provides a number of definitions for <a href=\"../../terms/i/d.htm#ideology\">ideology</a>,</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">\n(a) the process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life;<br />\n(b) a body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class;<br />\n(c) ideas which help to legitimate a dominant political power;<br />\n(d) false ideas which help to legitimate a dominant political power;<br />\n(e) systematically distorted communication;<br />\n(f) that which offers a position for a subject;<br />\n(g) forms of thought motivated by social interest;<br />\n(h) identity thinking;<br />\n(i) socially necessary illusion; <br />\n(j) the conjuncture of discourse and power;<br />\n(k) the medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world;<br />\n(l) action-oriented sets of beliefs;<br />\n(m) the confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality;<br />\n(n) semiotic closure;<br />\n(o) the indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure;<br />\n(p) the process whereby social life is converted to a natural reality.<br />\n(1976, p. 1-2) </p>\n<p>Eagleton expresses a cautious response to &#8220;&#8217;vulgar&#8217; Marxist&#8221; conceptions of literary works as an element in the &#8220;&#8217;base&#8217; and &#8216;superstructure&#8217;&#8221; (1991, p. 100).  He draws from other theories of ideology developed by <a href=\"../../people/g/r.htm#gramsci-antonio\">Antonio Gramsci</a> and <a href=\"../../people/l/u.htm#lukacs-georg\">Georg Luckács</a>, as well as conceptions of the &#8220;revolutionary subject&#8221; found in the writings of Pierre Macherey, and argues that the literary text is neither a representation of dominant ideology, nor an autonomous element (1991, p. 100).  Literature reports dissonances and contradictions within ideology, and in &#8220;putting ideology to work, the text necessarily illuminates the absences, and begins to &#8216;make speak&#8217; the silences of that ideology&#8221; (Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  For Eagleton, it becomes the critics&#8217; task to analyze and evaluate literature&#8217;s relation to dominant ideology and &#8220;to the complex historical <em>articulations </em>of these structures which produce the text&#8221; (1976, p. 44-45).  Criticism must not &#8220;situate itself within the same space as the text&#8221; (Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  It must attempt to &#8220;install itself in the very incompleteness of the work in order to <em>theorise</em> it &#8211; to explain the ideological necessity of those &#8216;<em>not-saids&#8217;</em>&#8221; ([Original emphasis] Eagleton 1976, p. 89).  </p>\n<p>Eagleton criticizes theorists such as <a href=\"../../people/a/d.htm#adorno-theodor\">Theodor Adorno</a> and <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#marcuse-herbert\">Herbert Marcuse</a>, who he suggests might have overestimated dominant ideology and instead claims, &#8220;capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification, all the way from commodity fetishism and speech habits to political bureaucracy and technological thought&#8221; (1976, p. 46).  However, as Eagleton concedes, &#8220;the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the system as a whole&#8221; (1976, p. 36).  Eagleton considers the literary text as an &#8220;open&#8221; source of conflicting languages, symbols, and genres that reveal &#8220;the limits and absences which mark [ideology&#8217;s] relation to history&#8221; (1976, p. 95).  </p>\n<p>In <em>Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism</em>, Eagleton examines the relation between Benjamin&#8217;s theoretical discourse and his own.  He describes the relation as &#8220;not one of reflection or reproduction&#8221; but more &#8220;a matter of imbricating the two languages to produce a third that belongs wholly to neither of us&#8221; (1981, p. xv).  Eagleton experiments with a political approach to literary studies by considering the body, carnivalesque and comedy, feminism, and cultural beliefs and practices.  His &#8220;critical account&#8221; positions Benjamin as a central figure in poststructuralist theory, whose work prefigures &#8220;many of the current motifs of post-structuralism&#8221; (1981, p. xvi) and &#8220;might be used to illuminate some key problems now confronting a &#8216;revolutionary criticism&#8217;&#8221; (1981, p. xv).  Eagleton prevents Benjamin&#8217;s Marxist theories from being &#8220;appropriated&#8221; and domesticated by the &#8220;critical establishment&#8221; (1981, p. xvi).  He presents Benjamin&#8217;s texts as collective backdrop for arguing interpretive strategies, as well as &#8220;an intervention into those [same] disputes&#8221; (1981, p. xvi).  </p>\n<p>Perhaps one of Eagleton&#8217;s most relevant objectives was to challenge the existence and purpose of academic and cultural institutions that define and value systems of knowledge that inform our lives.  In <em>Literary Theory: An Introduction</em>, he surveys a number of critical approaches from New Criticism and phenomenology to poststructuralism and psychoanalysis and concludes that literature and literary theory do not exist as immutable objects and methods of analysis (Eagleton 1983, p. 9).  Literature is the &#8220;highly-valued writing&#8221; of a particular historical period that is subject to the judgment system of the dominant culture (Eagleton 1983, p. 9-10).  While literary methodologies have much more in common with other disciplines such as &#8220;linguistics, history, sociology, and so on&#8221; then with each other (Eagleton 1983, p.172).  Eagleton celebrates the lack of methodological unity in literary studies.  He attempts to make modern literary theory more accessible and &#8220;intelligible&#8221; to a wider readership, by familiarizing them with the &#8220;implications of theory beyond literature itself&#8221; (1983, p. vii).  Eagleton proposes a new and diverse form of rhetorical study capable of addressing &#8220;the various sign-systems and signifying practices in our own society, all the way from Moby Dick to the Muppet show, from Dryden and Jean-Luc Goddard to the portrayal of women in advertisements and the rhetorical techniques of government reports&#8221; (1983, p.207).  Eagleton&#8217;s idea of diversity in critical methods and objects of analysis limits the potential for &#8220;&#8217;pure&#8217; literary critical judgment or interpretation&#8221; or &#8220;high culture,&#8221; and allows for the possibility of a more political and historical form of literary analysis (1983, p.18, 22).  </p>\n<p>Eagleton considers the state of literary and cultural theory in <em>After Theory</em> (2003).  </p>\n<p>Eagleton reflects on the theoretical contributions of golden age philosophers such as <a href=\"../../people/a/l.htm#althusser-louis\">Louis Althusser</a>, <a href=\"../../people/b/a.htm#barthes-roland\">Roland Barthes</a>, and <a href=\"../../people/d/e.htm#derrida-jacques\">Jacques Derrida</a> while questioning how we have &#8220;moved beyond them&#8221; (2003, p. 2).  As he suggests,</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">The generations which followed after these path-breaking figures did what generations which follow after usually do. They developed the original ideas, added to them, criticized them and applied them. Those who can, think up feminism or structuralism; those who can&#8217;t, apply such insights to <em>Moby-Dick</em> or <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. But the new generation came up with no comparable body of ideas of its own&#8221; (2003, p. 2). </p>\n<p>He considers the influence of sexuality and popular culture on critical studies.  He criticizes graduate students who have come to devalue the study of everyday life as &#8220;intricate, unfathomable, obscure, and occasionally tedious,&#8221; while often simultaneously writing &#8220;uncritical, reverential essays on <em>Friends</em>&#8221; (Eagleton 2003, p. 4-5).  Rather than trying to change the world, as Eagleton suggests, they have turned away from political action and displaced the impulse of the larger socialist movements of the golden age, and this counterturn has been a &#8220;politically catastrophic one&#8221; (2003, p. 16).  </p>\n<p>As Eagleton suggests, doctoral students, once a reservoir of critical innovation, now consider themselves responsible for facilitating an &#8220;oppositional&#8221; culture that lacks political impulses, and their research reflects a disposition of theoretical amnesia.  For Eagleton, they concentrate on &#8220;sensationalist subjects like vampirism and eye-gouging, cyborgs and porno movies,&#8221; which are of greater interest but less cultural and political value (2003, p. 3).  As Eagleton contends, for younger theorists &#8220;the politics of masturbation exert far more fascination than the politics of the Middle East&#8221; (2003, p. 2).  As intellectual matters retreat into the repetitions of everyday life, students endure &#8220;the risk of losing their ability to subject it to critique&#8221; (Eagleton 2003, p. 3).  </p>\n<p>Throughout his work, Eagleton has continuously attempted to harness political impulses, refashion rhetorical language, and educate readers about their relation to mass culture.  His desire to analyze and evaluate the tradition of criticism and the role of the critic has influenced students and theorists alike.  His arguments against postmodernism, a movement he once endorsed in <em>Literary Theory</em>, and in defense of Marxist theory provide a valuable critique of capitalism.  His theoretical turns and counterturns demonstrate the progression of a scholar toward a more mature and sophisticated understanding of his role as critic.  Eagleton urges his readers to ask questions and, in so doing, uncover contradictions within our selves and the cultural and political structures that shape our interactions.  Through his collective writings, Eagleton defends Marxist theory and attempts to provide his readers with a morally conscionable view of the world and their relation to it.  </p>\n<h5>Works Cited</h5>\n<p class=\"fst\">Eagleton, Terry. <em>After Theory</em>.

Other writers to the cooperative magazine included his sister, Crystal Eastman, Floyd Dell, <a href=\"../r/e.htm#reed-john\">John Reed</a>, Sherwood Anderson, Upton Sinclair, Amy Lowell and Louise Bryant. The journal moved further to the left under Eastman and took a strong stand against US involvement in WWI. As a result, in 1917, they lost mailing privileges and several of its editors were tried twice for violating the Espionage Act. <em>The Masses</em> was suppressed during the trials, but failing to get a conviction by the time the war ended, the government dropped its case. In 1918 Eastman joined with other radical writers to publish <em>The Liberator,</em> a magazine with similar intentions to <em>The Masses,</em> and remained with the publication until 1924, when it ran out of money and was taken over by the Communist Party. In 1922 he left the U.S. for a two year stay in the Soviet Union.\n</p><p>\nEastman also authored several books including, Understanding Germany (1916), Journalism Versus Art (1916) The Sense of Humor (1921) Leon Trotsky: Portrait of a Youth (1925), Marx, Lenin and the Science of Revolution (1926), Artists in Uniform (1934) and also translated several of Trotsky's books. Though on the forefront of getting Trotskyist issues to America and a supporter of Trotskyist publications, he was a critic of dialectical and <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism\">historical materialism</a> and the idea of Marxist philosophy as a science. \n</p><p>\nIn the 40's he became anti-communist and was a supporter of Joe McCarthy. He spent the last decades of his life writing for publications such as the Readers Digest and also wrote two volumes of autobiographical material, The Enjoyment of Living (1948) and Love and Revolution (1965).

        "content": "</a>\nMax Edwards was born in York, England, where he grew up with his parents and younger siblings, Esme and Toby.  He began writing a blog, <a href=\"https://theanonymousrevolutionary.com/\">The Anonymous Revolutionary</a> in 2014 when he was 15 years old.  He continued writing every Friday for the following 15 months, his tagline being &#8216;Marxism in the modern world&#8217;, despite simultaneously studying for his end of school exams and being diagnosed with terminal cancer. The fact that he only mentioned his illness in one blog, on 9th October 2015, under the title &#8216;Marxism, Opium and Morphine &#8211; Terminal Cancer from a Marxist Perspective&#8217;, is indicative of his passion for exploring Marxist political theory, and the calm, self effacing bravery with which he lived through an illness that would have destroyed most of us.  In the Views section of his blog Max writes:</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">I am a Marxist, Leninist, Bolshevist and Internationalist. I'd consider myself a Marxist in the orthodox sense, which is to say that I uphold the traditional view that the tyrannies of capitalism shall only be quashed through class struggle. In that sense, I'm also an anti-revisionist and am opposed to tendencies like Post-Marxism.</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">To develop a more in-depth understanding of the ideals I hold, you can look at writings by and about individuals such as Marx, Engels or Lenin.  I'd recommend the free online source Marxists Internet Archive to do this.</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">Additionally, my posts provide some of my own ideas and theoretical contributions to Marxist theory, although my views have changed significantly over the course of writing this blog, meaning that they may not be a reliable account of my current opinions. For example, I once referred to myself as a Trotskyist.  No longer the case.</p>\n<p>The foreword to his book of the same title is candid as to how the blogs entries trace the development of his thoughts on current politics and his own political ideology; the entries themselves are honest, witty and modest, whilst also being incisive and illuminating.  Max was an articulate and ardent supporter of Marxism; he believed it was relevant, and indeed vital to our progress in the emerging 21st Century.  He believed unequivocally in equality for all, in a way which could cause discomfort to some who believe that National, local ties should always come first.  Someone he had never met on the other side of the world would be equally deserving of any benefits humanity could provide in his eyes, as those nearest and dearest to him.</p>\n<p>But he was also irreverent and funny &#8211; no subject was off limits for Max&#8217;s sharp humour.  And he was a real polymath; there was very little in the world that didn&#8217;t interest him (and very little that he didn&#8217;t know or want to know about).  Max loved his home, his family, his dog Tiger, and Bruce the cat.  He was a talented musician, song writer and poet.  Max was full of ambition to travel, to study and to write.  When he died on 26th March 2016, aged just 16, he left us poems, songs, an unfinished musical, many, many maps of imaginary countries (complete with political systems and economies), was in the middle of teaching himself Russian and had outlined a second book about Marxism.  He is deeply loved and missed.</p>\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../e.htm\">Index of the Letter E</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"

This was the first experimental proof of the existence of the molecules, which Ernst Mach had regarded as no more than theoretical constructs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\n<span class=\"book\">On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light</span>, drew on Max Planck's observation that the spectrum of black-body radiation corresponded to the spectrum that would be expected if the emission of light resulted from discrete events, Einstein postulated that light is composed of individual quanta, in addition to exhibiting wave-like behaviour &#8211; a revolutionary approach to resolution of the seemingly inexplicable contradiction between Planck's observation and the accumulated mass of theory explaining optical phenomena on the basis of wave propagation. In the light of subequent history it is often forgotten that it was Einstein who made the quantum revolution, despite the fact that he would later maintain fundamental disagreements with the mainstream proponents of quantum mechanics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\n<span class=\"book\">On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</span> put forward what became known as the Special Theory of Relativity (special because it did not consider accelerated bodies, but only bodies in constant or &#8220;inertial&#8221; motion). Physics had been struggling with the contradictions arising from the Michelson-Morley experiment which demonstrated that the speed of light from the Sun measured on the surface of the Earth did not depend on the motion of the earth towards or away from the Sun, or through the &#8220;ether&#8221;. Lorentz had worked out that if the length of a body increased or decreased by a certain ratio according to its speed through the ether, then the result could be explained, but there was absolutely no rationale for such a dilation. Einstein's approach was entirely novel. Rather than questioning the results of the experiment or postulating new properties for the ether to explain the result, or calling into question Maxwell's laws of electro-dynamics which were only a few decades old, or even Newton's laws which were 200 years old, he assumed that all these laws were true and in fact postulated that all the laws of physics were <em>invariant with respect to transformation between inertial frames of reference</em> &#8211; i.e. the laws of physics were unaffected by movement through a co-called ether, and called into question Euclid's 2,000 year-old geometry. He subjected to painstaking, meticulous examination, the practice of measurement of time intervals and distances on which our conception of time and space are based. Through a series of &#8220;thought-experiments&#8221; he demonstrated that Lorentz's transformation was a simple, geometric result of the measurement process. The chief result was therefore to show that space and time had to be conceived in terms of the measurement processes they were associated with, rather than as entities which could be grasped by pure reason, something which everyone from Euclid to Kant and beyond had taken to be the case.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\n<span class=\"book\">Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?</span> was an addendum to the Special Relativity paper which observed that the famous <em>E</em> = <em>mc</em><SUP>2</SUP> followed from the theory. The equivalence between energy (E) and mass (m) knocked yet another fixture away from the physical conception of the world, and would of course later have the most profound effect on world politics with its application to the production of nuclear energy and the atom bomb.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese papers were quickly recognised by physicists around the world for the revolutionary achievements that they were. He left the patent office and by 1914 was at the University of Berlin, continuing research towards his <em>general</em> theory which would deal with accelerated motion and, what amounted to the same thing in Einstein's theory, gravitation, with only occasional requirements to lecture. His wife and two sons were trapped in Switzerland by the outbreak of the War and divorce followed a few years later. Mileva Maric was also a physicist and being married to the greatest physicist of all time was not an easy thing. While continuing with his work, Einstein distributed some pacifist literature to sympathisers in Berlin.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEinstein published the highly readable <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/einstein/works/1910s/relative/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Relativity: The Special and General Theory</a></span> in 1916, written for the general public and without complex mathematics, and <em>later</em> published the <span class=\"book\">The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity</span> in which the approach he had developed in dealing with uniform motion was applied to accelerated motion. If you were falling in a lift, under the influence of gravity, then the appearance would be &#8220;weightlessness&#8221;, but you would be falling faster and faster, and despite the fact that you can see nothing other than the lift which is falling with you, you can <em>feel</em> the falling. In other words, not only are the laws of physics <em>variant</em> with respect to accelerated motion, but acceleration is interchangeable with a gravitational field. The mathematical tool which allowed Einstein to deal with the complexities of this analysis was Riemann's Tensor Calculus &#8211; a &#8220;solution waiting for a problem&#8221;. This allowed Einstein to express the fundamental laws of physics in an entirely new way. The &#8220;forces&#8221; which had dominated 18th and 19th century physics were no longer present &#8211; only forms of movement expressed in equations of incredible simplicity, from which Maxwell's and Newton's laws cold be derived as special cases. It was Minkowski who later showed that they also allowed for the conception of a &#8220;4-dimensional distance&#8221;, in which time figures as a 4-th dimension but only by combination with the square root of minus one! Thus arose the mind-bending conceptions of &#8220;curved space-time&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe idea of large masses causing space-time to be curved could be verified by observing the bending of light rays during a total eclipse and in November 1919, the British Royal Society announced that an expidition which had been launched while the war was still raging had observed a solar eclipse and verified Einstein's predictions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDespite the deteriorating political situation in Germany, Einstein continued to attack nationalism and militarism and spoke out against anti-semitism. Einstein toured around the world lecturing on his theory while under constant attack by Nazis at home. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the 1920s, quantum mechanics continued to develop with <a href=\"../b/o.htm#bohr-niels\">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href=\"../h/e.htm#heisenberg-werner\">Werner Heisenberg</a> among those at the centre of this work. The formal character of the relativity theory and the quantum theory were very different and it was difficult to see how the two lines of development could be unified. Einstein continued to seek a resolution through a Unified Field Theory (the first attempt at which he published in 1929), and this kind of approach continues to this day though the terms have changed considerably. However, Einstein retained up to the time of his death reservations about the interpretation of the Schr&ouml;dinger Wave equation, which determines the <em>probabilty</em> of quantum events. Einstein never accepted that such an interpretation could be regarded as a complete description of a physical system, that events could be fundamentally without cause.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<em>Further Reading on this matter:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/bohr.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Bohr's Report of his Discussions with Einstein</span></a> and <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/einstein.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Einstein's Reply</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the world situation deteriorated, Einstein spent more and more effort in promoting pacifism including the establishment of a War Resisters' International Fund. In a famous exchange of letters with the Austrian psychiatrist <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Sigmund Freud</a>, Einstein speculated on the psychological basis for the war and fascism he saw around him. In a discussion of epistemology with the Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, Einstein defended basic philosophical materialist positions and in particular indicated support for the Pantheism of <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ne/spinoza.htm\" target=\"_top\">Spinoza</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and emigrated to England, moving to the U.S. in 1935 for a position at Princeton where he lived for the remainder of his life. From this time, Einstein urged Europe to arm and prepare for the inevitable war with Hitler. Most Western nations at this time regarded Hitler as a good anti-communist and Einstein's advocacy of war was given as little heed as had his pacificism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1939, <a href=\"../../people/b/o.htm#bohr-niels\">Niels Bohr</a>, told Einstein of Lise Meitner's success in splitting the uranium atom, and speculated on the prospect for the creation of an atom bomb. Though Einstein was sceptical, he was persuaded to write to President Roosevelt to begin atomic-bomb research. He was not included in the team that worked at Los Alamos and did not learn that a nuclear bomb had been made until Hiroshima was razed in 1945. He then joined those scientists seeking ways to prevent any future use of the bomb, his particular and urgent plea being the establishment of a world government under a constitution drafted by the US, Britain, and Russia. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1937, after years of failure advocating peaceful attempts to change the world, Einstein became involved with Communism. For the remainder of his life he would be a member, sponsor, or affiliate of at least 34 Communist organisations; and chaired three Communist organisations. Einstein spoke out against capitalism, and it's concentration of power into the hands of the few, and stressed the need for a revolutionary overthrow of capitalist governments. Such ideas did not go unnoticed: the FBI began documenting his activities and speeches, and filed claims against his \"communist-anarchist\" politics, ammassing into a <a href=\"https://vault.fbi.gov/Albert%20Einstein\">1,427 page report</a> by the time of his death. In 1949, Einstein's agitation gained wider attention when he wrote <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm\">Why Socialism?</a></span>, explaining that the only way for humanity to rid itself of the evils of capitalism is through the adoptation of Socialism. Einstein did not fully approve of Stalinist Socialism; arguing on several points in letters to Soviet scientists that freedom is necessary for Socialism to work.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe rejection of his ideals by bureaucrats on both sides did not break him, however, because his prime obsession still remained with physics. He published his new version of the unified field in 1950, a most meticulous mathematical essay that was immediately criticised by most physicists as untenable.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCompared with his renown of a generation earlier, Einstein was virtually neglected and ostracised in his later years; he said that he felt almost like a stranger in the world. His health deteriorated to the extent that he could no longer play the violin or sail his boat. On April 18, 1955, Einstein died in his sleep at Princeton Hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n "

He was also a leader of the International Red Aid (MOPR) organization based in Moscow.</p>\n<p>The son of Swedish Luthern immigrants, J. Louis Engdahl (who went by his middle name, &#8220;Louis&#8221;) was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 11, 1884. Engdahl was intelligent and well educated, he graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1907, having paid his way through school by working as a telegraph operator and as City Editor of the <em>Minneapolis Daily News.</em> Engdahl was a member of the Socialist Party from 1908.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n1\">[1]</a></sup> In 1909, he took a position as the Labor Editor of the <em>Chicago Daily Socialist</em>, assuming the mantle of Editor of that publicaton from 1910 until its termination in 1912.</p>\n<p>Engdahl attended the Copenhagen Congress of the Socialist International in 1910 as a journalist on behalf of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation. He joined the Socialist Party of America in September of 1912. Despite his traveling to Europe for the Scandinavian Federation, it does not seem that Engdahl ever directly participated in language federation politics in any way.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Louis Engdahl was a Socialist candidate for US Congress from Illinois in 1916; for the Chicago City Council in 1917; again for Congress in the Illinois 7th C.D. in 1918. He also was on the Organizing Committee of the Communist Propaganda League of Chicago from its origin in 1918 until its demise in 1919.</p>\n<p>In 1914, Engdahl assumed the position of Editor of <em>The American Socialist,</em> the Chicago-based official organ of the SPA. He continued to edit this newspaper each week until it was suppressed by postal authorities in 1917. Thereafter, he moved to the successor weekly publication, <em>The Eye Opener,</em> which he continued to edit until 1919.</p>\n<p>In February of 1918, Engdahl&#8217;s aggressive antimilitarism caused him to run afoul of the US Department of Justice, who targeted him as editor of the Socialist Party&#8217;s weekly newspaper under the Espionage Act for undermining the American military conscription program. Along with his party comrades Adolph Germer, Victor L. Berger, Bill Kruse, and Irwin St. John Tucker, Engdahl was indicted by a grand jury. The quintet was brought to trial before the harsh Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis on December 6, 1918 (that is, after the war had ended), with the trial ending during the first week of January 1919. The jury found all five guilty as charged, and Judge Landis imposed a draconian sentence of 20 years in the Federal Penitentiary upon each. This sentence was later overturned on appeal for the reason of judicial bias.</p>\n<p>Out pending appeal on $25,000 bond, Engdahl was a delegate from Illinois to the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party, refusing to either support Adolph Germer, James Oneal, and the party regulars or to bolt the convention to join either of the fledgling Communist organizations &#8211; the Communist Labor Party or the Communist Party of America. Instead, Engdahl stayed inside the Socialist Party as a leader of the remaining Left Wing faction, which congealed as the Committee for the Third International in 1920. Engdahl served as Secretary of this faction until it departed the party in the aftermath of the 1921 Convention.</p>\n<p>From 1920 until July of 1921, Engdahl served as editor of the <em>Chicago Socialist,</em> publication of Local Cook County of the SPA, until he was finally removed for political reasons. He was also the Secretary of Local Cook County SPA until his resignation on July 21, 1921.</p>\n<p>After the disappointment of the 1921 Convention of the SPA, the Committee for the Third International left the party to mark the world with a short-lived existence as part of the Workers Council group &#8211; a small group of Communist adherents who sought to turn their backs on the sectarian infighting of the underground Communist parties. This pro-Comintern/anti-underground position proved to be timely, as in December 1921, at the Comintern&#8217;s request, a &#8220;Legal Political Party&#8221; called the Workers Party of America was established at a convention in New York. The Workers Council group was absorbed into the WPA at this time. He was elected to the 7 member &#8220;Administrative Council&#8221; of the WPA on Oct. 10, 1921. He stood as the WPA&#8217;s candidate for Congress in the New York 12th C.D. in 1922. In January 1923 he was elected by the 2nd Convention of the WPA to the party&#8217;s Central Executive Committee and sat on the inner circle of this group called the Executive Council.</p>\n<p>Engdahl was employed as Managing Editor of the WPA&#8217;s organ, <em>The Worker,</em> from 1922. When that paper moved to daily status in January 1924, Engdahl wore the hat of Editor, although as an adherent of the minority Pepper-Ruthenberg-Lovestone faction, he was saddled with a co-editor from the majority Foster-Cannon-Lore faction in February. He continued as an Editor at <em>The Daily Worker</em> until 1928.</p>\n<p>In February of 1925, Engdahl was a candidate of the Workers (Communist) Party for Chicago City Alderman.</p>\n<p>From May 1927 through February 1928, Engdahl was a member of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, representing the Workers (Communist) Party of America.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July 1929, Engdahl was appointed by the CEC of the Communist Party as National Secretary of International Labor Defense (ILD), the party&#8217;s legal aid arm. He was named to the Polburo of the Communist Party in 1930 and was the party&#8217;s delegate to the Comintern in Moscow in that same year. He was also a member and later Chairman of the CPUSA&#8217;s Central Control Committee, as well as a member of the Presidium of International Red Aid (MOPR) &#8211; the international umbrella organization of the ILD.</p>\n<p>In Moscow on MOPR business, Engdahl died of pneumonia on November 21, 1932, at the age of 48.</p>\n<p>Despite the fairly vast number of words he wrote throughout his career as a journalist, Louis Engdahl did not write any books and only a handful of pamphlets, including <em>Debs and O&#8217;Hare in Prison</em> (1919); <em>The Tenth Year</em> (1927); <em>Gastonia: A Class Case and a Class Verdict</em> (1929) and <em>Sedition!</em> (1930).

In rejecting Hegel's philosophy and advocating materialism, criticising religion and idealism, Feuerbach emphasised the individual, purely \"biological\" nature of man. He saw thought as a purely reflective, contemplative process, and in his understanding of history remained an idealist. Nevertheless, his critique of Hegel's idealism laid the basis for Marx and Engels' work. Two years before his death he joined the German Social Democratic Party founded by Marx, but he was not politically active.</p>\n\n<p>\nBoth Marx and Engels were strongly influenced by Feuerbach, though they thoroughly critiqued him for inconsistent materialism:  <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm\" target=\"_top\">Theses on Feurbach</a>; M <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm\" target=\"_top\">German Ideology</a>, and <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Ludwig Feuerbach and The End of Classical German Philosophy</a> (and others). Engels wrote in the latter work:\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;... the main body of the most determined Young Hegelians was, by the practical necessities of its fight against positive religion, driven back to Anglo-French materialism. This brought them into conflict with the system of their school.</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;While materialism conceived nature as the sole reality, nature in the Hegelian system represents merely the &quot;alienation&quot; of the absolute idea, so to say, a degradation of the idea. At all events, thinking and its thought-product, the idea, is here the primary, nature the derivative, which only exists at all by the condescension of the idea. And in this contradiction they floundered as well or as ill as they could.</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;Then came Feuerbach's <span class=\"book\">Essence of Christianity</span>. With one blow it pulverised the contradiction, in that without circumlocutions it placed materialism on the throne again. Nature exists independently of all philosophy. It is the foundation upon which we human beings, ourselves products of nature, have grown up. Nothing exists outside nature and man, and the higher beings our religious fantasies have created are only the fantastic reflection of our own essence. </p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;The spell was broken; the &quot;system&quot; was exploded and cast aside, and the contradiction, shown to exist only in out imagination, was dissolved. One must oneself have experienced the liberating effect of this book to get an idea of it. Enthusiasm was general; we all became at once Feuerbachians.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\nIn the <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Principles of the Philosophy of the Future</a></span>, Feuerbach puts his philosophical position concisely and comprehensively into one work. The <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/future0.htm\" target=\"_top\">first section</a> includes Feuerbach's interpretation of the history of philosophy up to Hegel. The <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/future1.htm\" target=\"_top\">second section</a> is probably the best, Feuerbach's critique of Hegel, and <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/feuerbach/works/future/future2.htm\" target=\"_top\">final part</a> puts forward his own position, which is very weak really, and is subject to withering criticism in <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch03.htm\" target=\"_top\">Part III</a> of Engels' booklet.</p>\n<p>\nFeuerbach, who Marx described as the &#8220;true conqueror of the old philosophy&#8221;, was a revolutionary, and at the end of his life joined the German Social Democratic Party, but he retained his differences with Marx to the end.

[from <span class=\"book\">Hegel for Beginners</span>] </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the death of Kant in 1804, Fichte was the &#8220;master&#8221; of &#8220;Classical German Philosophy.&#8221; In contrast to Kant&#8217;s essential conservatism, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel were all fervent supporters of the French Revolution (though each hotly contested the philosophical system of the other), and determined to find a way out of the unsatisfactory, contradiction-ridden philosophy with which Kant sought to &#8220;make peace&#8221; in philosophy. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFichte rejected Kant&#8217;s dualism, in particular: </p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nhis concept of the &#8220;thing-in-itself&#8221; existing outside of, beyond sensuous perception, which was necessarily lacking in internal contradictions, but regarding which Understanding could prove mutually exclusive propositions, and </p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nKant&#8217;s &#8220;dualistic&#8221; conception of the Ego, as both <em>Reason</em> (when contemplating the activity of thought) and <em>Understanding</em> (when contemplating the empirically given external world). </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFichte set the task as creating a Doctrine of Knowledge which would be one-and-the-same for all individuals and all activities of thought. All Knowledge is by virtue of God, and the Ego is first manifested in the form of a primitive Intuition, and &#8220;this Power, which now through perception and recognition of itself has become an Ego.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThought, or &#8220;intelligising&#8221;, is based on the activity of this Intuition. For Fichte, the Doctrine of Knowledge was exclusively concerned with studying thought-forms, concepts, and for him there could be no question of understanding &#8220;the object before its expression in a concept.&#8221; He abolished Kant&#8217;s dualism by putting rejection altogether any concern with &#8220;things-in-themselves&#8221;, beyond sensation. This was a &#8220;subjective idealist&#8221; solution to Kant&#8217;s scepticism. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nThere can be an Actual Being out of God only through the self-realisation of this absolute Power: - this Power, however, can only produce pictures or Schemae, which by combination become Actual Knowledge. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIntuition was essentially ridden with contradiction because Intuition reflected Being in continual movement and change. Thus contradiction was not a product of imperfect thought, but derived from Intuition and ultimately from movement and change in the world beyond knowledge. Nevertheless, Fichte aimed to establish a doctrine of knowledge which would be comprehensive and free of contradictions, describing the general laws of the movement of thought-forms. Kant insisted that this was impossible, and did not accept Fichte&#8217;s criticisms.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFichte sought to build up a science of the forms of thought based on their evolution from the primitive forms of Intuition. Logic was but a subordinate formal system within the Doctrine of Knowledge, not its &#8220;master.&#8221; This approach is an important step towards the system of Logic later developed by Hegel and presages also the genetic epistemology of more recent times.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, it is the subjective-idealism of Fichte&#8217;s solution which has proved to be the most influential since - the logical positivists and others who emphasise concepts as constructs of the Mind and reject any possibility of the existence of things outside the mind to which these concepts refer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/fichte/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Johann Gottlieb Fichte Archive</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> Fichte&#8217;s <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/fichte.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Outlines of the Doctrine of Knowledge</span></a>.

Foucault&#8217;s analysis of the mechanisms of social power have been embraced by many social movements (such as People With AIDS) because of its explication of the de-centering of power and its facility in criticising almost any coherent theory of history or society.</p>\n<p>\nThe son of a physician, Foucault studied under the (&#8220;post-&#8221;)-Marxist philosopher <a href=\"../a/l.htm#althusser-louis\">Louis Althusser</a> at the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, Paris, and at the University of Clermont-Ferrand between 1960 and 1968 and then spent two years at the University of Paris-Vincennes.

Society's use of the concept of madness in the 17th century is the subject of his <span class=\"book\">Madness and Civilisation</span> (1961). In his book <span class=\"book\">Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison</span> (1975) he examined the origins of the modern penal system. In these and other books, Foucault put forth the thesis that institutions such as asylums, hospitals, and prisons are society's devices for exclusion and that by surveying social attitudes in relation to these institutions, one can examine the development and uses of power. Foucault shows how an issue (such as sexuality) is deemed in one period to be a religious issue, at another a medical problem, at another an issue of crime and punishment, and so on. However, Foucault's method militates against all kinds of generalisation, all conceptions of &#8220;historical period&#8221; for example, which he regarded as a questionable construction. The relation of his method to that of his Structuralist predecessors is much like that of mathematical analysis (based on ideas of continuity) to discrete mathematics, in which only numbers exist.

Still more masterly is his criticism of the bourgeois form of\nthe relations between sexes, and the position of woman in bourgeois\nsociety. He was the first to declare that in any given society the\ndegree of woman's emancipation is the natural measure of the general\nemancipation.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"But Fourier is at his greatest in his conception of the history of\nsociety. He divides its whole course, thus far, into four stages of\nevolution -- savagery, barbarism, the patriarchate, civilization. This\nlast is identical with the so-called civil, or bourgeois, society of\ntoday -- i.e., with the social order that came in with the 16th century.\nHe proves \"that the civilized stage raises every vice practiced by\nbarbarism in a simple fashion into a form of existence, complex,\nambiguous, equivocal, hypocritical\" -- that civilization moves \"in a\nvicious circle\", in contradictions which it constantly reproduces\nwithout being able to solve them; hence it constantly arrives at the\nvery opposite to that which it wants to attain, or pretends to want to\nattain, so that, e.g., \"under civilization poverty is born of\nsuperabundance itself\".\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"Fourier, as we see, uses the dialectic method in the same masterly way\nas his contemporary, Hegel. Using these same dialectics, he argues\nagainst talk about illimitable human perfectibility, that every\nhistorical phase has its period of ascent and also its period of\ndescent, and he applies this observation to the future of the whole\nhuman race. As Kant introduced into natural science the idea of the\nultimate destruction of the Earth, Fourier introduced into historical\nscience that of the ultimate destruction of the human race.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"inline\">\nFredrick Engels<br />\n<span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Development of Socialism from Utopia to Science</a></span><br />\n<a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm\" target=\"_top\">Part 1: French Socialism</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>&#160; </p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../f.htm\">Index of the Letter F</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n"

        "content": "\nGerman mathematician and logician, who founded modern mathematical logic, working on the borderline between philosophy and mathematics, in the foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic; though he wrote little which is readable to the non-mathematician, his achievements in mathematical logic were startling and extremely influential; unable to complete the <a href=\"../../terms/l/o.htm\">Logicist</a> project, he ended his life with a feeling of having failed, despite the revolution he wrought in his chosen field.</p>\n<p>\nFrege entered the University of Jena in 1869 and then went to the University of G&ouml;ttingen to study mathematics, physics, chemistry, and philosophy, subsequently spending the remainder of his working life teaching all branches of mathematics at Jena. He kept aloof from his students and even more aloof from his colleagues.</p>\n<p>\nFrege was a Lutheran and a political reactionary. He loved the Kaiser, and during World War I developed an intense hatred of socialism, democracy, the French, Catholics and Jews. Convinced of his own genius, he became increasingly bitter at his lack of recognition, a fact which resulted from the novelty of his mathematical ideas.</p>\n<p>\nFrege published his <span class=\"book\">Begriffsschrift</span> (&#8220;Concept-script&#8221;) in 1879, presenting for the first time, a system of mathematical logic in the modern sense. No one, however, comprehended what Frege had done, and when, some decades later, the subject began to get under way, he was not given credit for those of his ideas which had been adopted by others. Bertrand Russell was the only mathematician to give him credit during his lifetime.</p>\n<p>\nFrege's work represents the beginning of modern logic because of his invention of the notation of quantifiers and variables (&quot;For every x&quot; or &quot;For some x.&quot;). By means of this notation he solved problems that had always baffled logicians . In him there also appeared the first clear distinction between the <em>formal</em> characterisation of logical laws and their <em>semantic justification</em>.</p>\n<p>\nRecognising that the <span class=\"book\">Begriffsschrift</span>, was full of unfamiliar symbolism which no-one understood, he resolved that his next book would be written without the use of symbols at all. <span class=\"book\">The Foundations of Arithmetic</span> (1884) was a masterpiece of philosophical writing, but the only review that the book received, was a hostile review by <a href=\"../../people/c/a.htm#cantor-georg\">Georg Cantor</a>. Frege devoted the next decade to a series of articles elaborating the philosophy of Logicism, but his work continued to be largely ignored and occasionally belittled.</p>\n<p>\nWhile volume 2 of his <span class=\"book\">Basic Laws of Arithmetic</span> was at the printer's, he received a letter from Bertrand Russell pointing out that the system of axioms could lead to a contradiction. The two exchanged many letters; and, before the book was published, Frege had devised a modification of one of his axioms to restore consistency to the system. But after Frege's death in 1925, it was discovered that the modified system still led to contradiction and still later it emerged that many of the proofs of Volume 1 were flawed. It is generally presumed that Frege himself must have realised this during his efforts to restore the system to consistency.</p>\n<p>\nAfter 1903, Frege took no further part in the development of mathematical logic. At the very end of his life, he again started to work on the philosophy of mathematics, having concluded that the attempt to found mathematics on logic was mistaken, but the work was never completed.</p>\n<p>\nFrege's philosophy, known as Logicism, asserts all of mathematics to be derivable from logic without the use of any specifically mathematical concepts. Bertrand Russell and Alan Whitehead attempted to complete this project, which was finally abandoned with the discovery of <a href=\"../g/o.htm#godel-kurt\">G&ouml;del</a>'s theorem.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"../w/i.htm#wittgenstein-ludwig\">Wittgenstein</a>, who visited Frege in 1914, attempted to continue Frege's project in an attempt to develop an &quot;ideal language&quot; modelled on Frege's mathematical logic, excluding as meaningless what could not be expressed &quot;logically&quot; in this way.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\nSee  Ernst Kolman and Sonya Yanovskaya's <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/kolman.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Hegel &amp; Mathematics</span></a> and <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/help/maths.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Value &amp; Quantity</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nAustrian psychologist; founder of psychoanalysis who made a systematic study of the Unconscious and introduced many key concepts still used in modern psychology. For all its faults, Freud&#8217;s theory was the first materialist theory of the psyche; like his contemporary Pavlov, Freud was a philosophical materialist of the old school, and between them they mark a watershed between the psychology of the 19th and that of the 20th centuries. While Freud was careful not to claim expertise outside his own area of work, his followers have freely applied his concepts to history and society in a way that Freud would not have supported.</p>\n<p>\nFreud's father was a Jewish merchant who had been married once before and was 40 years old when Freud was born, a relatively remote and authoritarian figure. In 1860 the family moved to Vienna, where Freud remained until the Nazi invasion in 1939. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1873, Freud entered the University of Vienna to study medicine, where he worked with  Ernst von Br&uuml;cke, an exponent of <a href=\"../../people/h/e.htm#helmholtz-hermann\">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>'s anti-vitalism. In 1882, he entered the General Hospital in Vienna to train in psychiatry, and was appointed lecturer in neuropathology. It was during this period that Freud advocated the use of cocaine, leading to a close friend becoming addicted, and this episode left somewhat of a cloud over his reputation for a time.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1885, Freud went to Paris, to work under Jean-Martin Charcot who was using hypnosis to cure patients suffering from paralysis. The idea of treating apparently physiological disorders by treating the <em>mind</em>, ran directly counter to the dominant positivistic spirit of the science of the day. Freud never succeeded in mastering the art of hypnosis, and this obliged him to develop an alternative method of working on the mind. Nevertheless, Freud now had the key idea which was to determine his future work, and returned to Vienna after a very short stay in Paris.</p>\n<p>\nIt was the physician Josef Breuer, who had cured an hysterical patient by simply encouraging her to talk about her problem, who provided Freud with a line of research, and 10 years later he published a joint paper with Breuer on the use of free association as a technique for uncovering the roots of psychosis.</p>\n<p>\nThe key insight to which the work with free association led Freud was that there was something called the &#8220;Unconscious&#8221; (not a concept that Freud invented, but he was the first to systematically investigate it and develop a definite conception of the structure of the psyche), but for whatever reason the content of this Unconscious mind was repressed and hidden from consciousness; however, from time to time people would make a &#8220;slip of the tongue&#8221; or in one way or another say something from which the contents of the Unconscious could be inferred. The point then was to develop ways of bringing these unconscious thoughts to light so that the patient themselves could deal with them.</p>\n<p>\nIn the course of this study &#8211; to which he gave the name &#8216;Psychoanalysis&#8217; in 1896 &#8211; Freud formed the view that the principal content of this unconscious was sexual, even though the patients did not directly articulate this. For example, a recollection of sexual contact with an adult in their childhood, Freud took to be evidence of sexuality on the part of the child, expressed in the form of fantasy.</p>\n<p>\nFreud's early work concentrated on female hysteria, but in order to formulate a general theory of the mind, Freud had to broaden his work to study the psyche of the normal male. Freud began by studying the one psyche to which he had direct access &#8211; his own. However, the psychoanalytic movement he began reserved the privilege of self-analysis for its founder alone; every psychoanalyst is inducted into the profession by being psychoanalysed by a psychoanalyst, thus joining a genealogy linking back to Sigmund Freud's original self-analysis.</p>\n<p>\nIn <span class=\"book\">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, he interspersed evidence from his own dreams with evidence from those recounted in his clinical practice. Freud saw dreams as essentially a form of wish fulfilment, in which the real meaning of the unconscious is &#8220;coded&#8221; in the form of images taken from everyday experience, and regarded dreams as the &#8220;royal road to the unconscious&#8221;.</p>\n<p>\nCentred on the concept of repression of sexual desire, Freud developed explanations for hysteria, obsessive compulsions, paranoia, and narcissism. However, it should be noted that a considerable part of Freud's achievement is easily separable from his conviction that sexual frustration lay at the root of all these disorders. Although Freud's theories scandalised the sexually repressed Vienna of his day, they attracted wide interest across Europe, and in 1902 Freud's so-called Psychological Wednesday Circle began to gather, including <a href=\"../../people/a/d.htm#adler-alfred\">Alfred Adler</a> and Wilhelm Stekel and <a href=\"../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl\">Carl Jung</a> among participants. In 1908, the group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society which grew to become an international organisation, but the Society was always marked by sharp splits between its founder and others who grew to rival him, such as Alfred Adler who Freud broke with in 1911, followed by breaks with Stekel, Jung and Wilhelm Reich.</p>\n<p>\nFreud constructed a very elaborate &#8220;topology&#8221; for the Mind, including the division of the psyche into the Unconscious, Preconscious, and Conscious and structural components called the Id, the Ego, and the Superego. See his Lecture <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/at/freud2.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Anatomy of the Mental Personality</a></span> for an outline.

Some historians have argued that Stalin was involved in arranging Frunze's death.</p>\n<p>\nLeon Trotsky described Mikhail Frunze's achievements during the Russian Civil War:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\nFrunze was a man of serious disposition; as a result of his prison years, he had more authority in the Party than the fresh young Sklyansky. Moreover, during the war Frunze demonstrated undeniable qualities as a war captain.</p>\n<p>\nAfter the Yaroslav rebellion, Frunze was appointed Commissar for the Yaroslav Military District. From there he was transferred to the Urals Front and under his command the Southern Army Group of the Eastern Front inflicted a decisive defeat on Kolchak's troops. Following this, he was put in charge of the whole Eastern Front and directed the operations to sweep the Whites out of Turkestan.</p>\n<p>\nDuring the revolution in Bukhara in August which overthrew the Emir's forces out of the Bukharan Republic with detachments of the Red Army. In September 1920 he ordered an offensive against Wrangel on the Southern Front. After the seizure of the Crimea and the elimination of Wrangel's forces, he became commander of all troops in the Crimea and the Ukraine, and the representative of the Revolutionary Military Council there. Under his leadership the Petlyura and Makhno rebellions were crushed. </p>\n<p>\nAt the tenth Congress in 1921, Frunze was elected to the Central Committee. It was no doubt then that he allied himself with Zinoviev imposed him in Skylyansky's place, and then in Trotsky's in January 1925, as Commissar for War. The collapse of the Troika made Frunze's presence in this position extremely awkward for Stalin.</p>\n<p>\nFrunze had formerly suffered from stomach ulcers. The Central Committee doctors, on orders from Stalin, insisted that he should be operated on; Frunze's doctors were opposed to it, for they were certain that his heart would not stand up to the chloroform. The Central Committee doctors had their way, and Frunze died on the operating table on 31st October 1925. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/\">Spartacus Schoolnet</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160; </p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../f.htm\">Index of the Letter F</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"skip\">&#160;</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"

        "content": "\nItalian physicist and astronomer; the founder of experimental science. In a world dominated by the dogmatic enforcement of the teachings of Aristotle, Galileo used the systematic application of the experimental method to formulate the most basic laws of mechanics - inertia and the principle of the relativity of motion. By applying the telescope to observation of the skies, Galileo proved the validity of Copernicus's heliocentric system. Galileo thus developed a scientific method based on observation, experiment and the method of induction and a mechanical, causal conception of Nature. As is well-known, Galileo suffered severe repression from the Church for his views, and was forced to write God into his system.</p>\n<p>\nA good exposition of his works can be found in &quot;The Galileo Affair&quot;, which collects together a series of letters and statements by Galileo with the documents of the Inquisition demanding that Galileo recant and affirm the literal interpretation of the Bible upheld by the Inquisitors. The final document is Galileo's &quot;self-criticism&quot;.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1600, the great Italian materialist philosopher, Giodarno Bruno, had been burnt at the stake for, among other things, upholding the Copernican conception of the Heliocentric universe, and despite the fact that Copernicus had been commissioned by the Church to formulate a better method of predicting the movement of the heavens in order to overcome defects in the Calendar, he was also forced to recant.</p>\n<p>\nNot only are Galileo's arguments in defence of the Copernican view compelling to the point where it is difficult for us to comprehend today how the Inquisitors could withstand them, but Galileo also demonstrates that they may silence him in vain, for conditions of life in Europe were leading more and more people to observe with their own eyes the movement and form of the heavenly bodies, and more and more people were coming to the same conclusions as he, and the Church would do well to stay away from anything that might prove liable to refutation by empirical obervation or naturalistic reason.</p>\n<p>\nIn this short article, the profundity of Galileo's understanding of the nature and tasks of natural science is astounding. Not only does he present the argument in favour of the Heliocentric System with a fine balance of empirical evidence and the evidence of Reason, but he very explicitly rejects the &quot;compromise&quot; offered him - to admit that the heliocentric assumption is made solely &quot;for the convenience of organising the observations&quot;, and not at all a statement that material bodies actually move in this way, outside of human perception! Right at the very beginning of the development of natural science then, we see its greatest advocate recognising positivism in the camp of theology! On the contrary, he says, astronomers have to reduce the positions calculated on the basis of a theory of objective heliocentric motion to lines-of-sight referred to the point of view of an Earthly observer in order to be able to utilise the mass of experiemental data, all of which is made by Earth-bound human observers - in other words the germs of the twentieth century Principle of Correspondence, used by <a href=\"../../people/e/i.htm#einstein-albert\">Einstein</a> in his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity.</p>\n<p>\nAlso, we see a clear formulation of the principle of relativity, and the conception of the distinciton between Essence and Appearance, inso far as Galileo distinguishes between the &quot;idealised&quot; motion and the minor &quot;deviations&quot; from that trajectory.</p>\n<p> Galilieo also did fundamental work on mechanics, rolling balls down inclined slopes and timing them with a very primitive &quot;stop watch&quot;.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> Galilelo: <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/it/galileo.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">On the Copernican Opinion</span></a>.</p>\n\n"

After the 1917 Revolution, Garden formed the Industrial Vigilance Council with the aim of transforming the ALP into a revolutionary party. Expelled from the ALP in 1919. Joined the de Leonist SLP.in August 1919, but expelled in November 1919 for publishing the Manifesto of a 'secret communist party' with some of those trade unionists who had left the NSW ALP, WP Earsman  and members of the Victorian Socialist Party (VSP). It was this 'secret Communist Party' which issued the call for the founding of a CPA. Following an early split, Garden's group was recognised by the Comintern in August 1922. Garden won support among militant unionists and conducted a successful intervention at the All-Australian Trades Union Congress of 1921, at which 15 per cent of the delegates were members of the CPA. After the ALP banned the CPA, Garden proposed continued secret membership to avoid isolation, but in 1926 Garden led his supporters in the NSW Labour Council out of the Party, after defying CPA policy by supporting a left break-away from the Queensland ALP. Jock Garden drifted out of the CPA mainly due to the conflict between retaining leadership in the trade union movement while being publicly identified with positions which were minority positions even in the organised working class. Remained a part of the Red International of Labour Unions and the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, breaking only when denounced as 'social fascists'. Garden then became the driving force behind the powerful 'socialisation' movement of the period of Lang's ALP Premiership in NSW. Garden was a powerful and eloquent speaker and a skilled organiser. Although never regarded as a 'theorist', he was a formidable political operator.\n</p>\n\n"

        "content": "\nJules de Gaultier spent his philosophical career in opposition to what he called in the title of a book published in 1922, &#8220;official philosophy.&#8221; He never held an academic position, working instead for the Ministry of Finance, publishing books and articles, and residing in provincial Boulogne-sur-Mer most of his life. An early supporter of the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, his 1900 &#8220;De Kant à Nietzsche&#8221; presents Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as alternatives to the Kantism then regnant in the philosophical world. His greatest contribution is the concept of &#8220;<em>bovarysme</em>, &#8220;which he initially developed in his 1892 &#8220;Le Bovarysme, la Psychologie dans l&#8217;Oeuvre de Flaubert&#8221; (&#8220;Bovarysm, or Psychology in the Oeuvre of Flaubert&#8221;) and which he elaborated on in &#8220;Le Bovarysme, Essai sur le Pouvoir de l&#8217;Imagination,&#8221; (&#8220;Bovarysm, Essay on the Power of the Imagination&#8221;) published in 1902. <em>Bovarysme</em> is defined as &#8220;man&#8217;s power to conceive himself other than he is,&#8221; i.e., the power of our imagination to overwhelm our true natures, of our imagination of the coloration of situations to lead us to misinterpret these situations. Gaultier found the basis for this theory in Flaubert&#8217;s character Emma Bovary, whose (fictional) life came to a sad end because the character viewed all around her, all that occurred to her through the prism of her romantic notions. Starting with the application of his theory to the individual, Gaultier expanded his use of this concept to history and human society, with nations misleading themselves concerning their true nature , their &#8220;national genius,&#8221; and history in general being viewed through a false prism. The theory thus has a negative and a positive character: it leads individuals and nations to misjudge themselves, but it also implies the ability to act, to escape the boundaries one has been set. </p>\n<p>Gaultier played a central role in precipitating the suicide of his former friend, the individualist philosopher Georges Palante. Gaultier had helped Palante succeed him as philosophy critic at the &#8220;Mercure de France, &#8220; and their relations had always been more than cordial. But an unfavorable review by Palante of Gaultier&#8217;s &#8220;La Philosophie officielle et la Philosophie&#8221; in 1922 led to an unpleasant exchange of correspondence, which finally led to Gaultier&#8217;s challenging Palante to a duel. For the rest of his days Palante felt himself to have been rendered ridiculous by the process. Stéphane Beau says in an essay on the relations between the two men that &#8220;the duel manqué certainly weighed among the burdens that made [Palante&#8217;s] life unbearable, but the connection is too tenuous for us to read a cause and effect relation&#8221; between it and Palante&#8217;s death. There is no question though that it was a contributing factor, and he committed suicide in 1925. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">Mitchell Abidor</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/gaultier/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Gaultier Archive</a></p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../g.htm\">Index of the Letter G</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n"

As semi-wealthy Jews, Goldman and her family at times suffered from social and political persecution. By the time she was 16 (1885), in conflict with her father who tried to marry her off, she emigrated with her half-sister to the United States (Rochester, New York), where she began working in clothing factories. At 19, she was married for ten months, when she divorced her husband. Her two volume, 56 chapter autobiography <em>Living My Life </em>, begins three years after her arrival in the United States:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nIT WAS THE 15TH OF AUGUST 1889, THE DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN New York City. I was twenty years old. All that had happened in my life until that time was now left behind me, cast off like a worn-out garment. A new world was before me, strange and terrifying. But I had youth, good health, and a passionate ideal. Whatever the new held in store for me I was determined to meet unflinchingly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter her move, she became close to Alexander Berkman, who together (in 1892) attempted to assassinate Henry Clay Frick, during the homestead steel strike. To raise money for buying the gun, Goldman unsuccessfully tried to prostitute herself. Their attempt of assassination was a failure, Frick was slightly injured, and workers were not at all incited to revolt. Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison, while Goldman attempted to defend Berkman with a passionately moral argument; her own involvement in the assassination was not tried. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1893, however, Goldman was imprisoned for her first time, after attempting to incite striking workers to revolt. Goldman was again imprisoned after distributing birth control literature. In 1906, Berkman was freed early from his prison term, and together they began again political education &#8211; founding Mother Earth, a periodical Goldman edited until it was forcibly suppressed by the U.S. government in 1917. In 1908 her naturalization as a U.S. citizen was revoked. Goldmann nevertheless stayed in the U.S., and continued to publicly speak on anarchism and also on the current European drama of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, George Bernard Shaw, and others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n In 1917, Goldman was imprisoned again (for two years) for setting up \"No Conscription\" leagues and speaking out against the <em>US</em> involvement in the war. In 1919, along with Berkman and 247 others, she was forcibly deported from United States to Soviet Russia as a subversive.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere Goldman saw Russia for the first time under Soviet rule and strongly disapproved.  She was horrified by the terrible living conditions in Russia and the repressive Soviet government. In the beginning she strongly spoke out against the government for its repressive measures against those who were attacking it during the <a href=\"../../events/r/u.htm#rcw\"> Civil War</a>.  After the end of the (Western) Civil War, the nation in ruins by the destruction, Goldman chastised the government for the poor living conditions.  When the Soviet government began encouraging the opposition parties, once brutally repressed, to help rebuild the nation, Goldman was outraged, believing that this was the ultimate compromise of revolutionary principles &#8211; to allow these \"bourgeois\" into the government.  A few other anarchists joined Goldman in voicing extreme opposition to this, and attempted to start another Civil War.  The first and last result of these attempts happened at Kronstadt, where mutinying soldiers attempted to lead a Civil War against the Soviet government. After this was brutally crushed by the Soviet government, Goldman, to disillusioned to continue to be revolutionary, left Soviet Russia for Western Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the last 20 years of her life she remained active through lecturing and writing.  She later joined the antifascist cause in Spain during its Civil War and died working on its behalf.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em> See: </em> <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/goldman/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"> Emma Goldman Reference Archive </a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nHerman Gorter was born on November 26, 1864, the son of a famous Dutch <em>litterateur</em>. He was keen student of the classics and became a teacher of Greek and Latin. Gorter created a great stir with his poem, <em>May</em>, which expressed a worship of nature in a language never heard before. He broke with tradition and established rules and expressed the feelings as they were actually felt. In 1880, Gorter gathered about him a group of young poets and developed the literary revolution known as &#8220;the movement of the Eighties.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>But Gorter soon perceived that this movement did not go very far and he turned to a study of ancient of Greek and Egyptian culture to understand the reason of their powerful development. The result was expressed in an essay: Critique of the movement of the Eighties. </p>\r\n<p>Gorter studied philosophy, translating Spinoza&#8217;s <em>Ethics</em>, studying Immanuel Kant and finally reading Marx&#8217;s <em>Capital</em>. In Marx he had found what he wanted and he began a deep study of the writings of Marx and Engels. </p>\r\n<p>In 1890, Gorter joined the social Democratic Labour Party in Holland, S.D.A.P. At first the party rejoiced in his membership, but he soon found himself in conflict with the Party leadership. Nevertheless, he emerged as a great marxist theoretician and one of the most powerful speakers in Holland. <em>Het Volk</em>, the social democratic organ, complained that socialism was, to him a fine dream, an unattainable utopia. He was a clear and convincing speaker, they said, but he disrupted the party with his accusations of political corruption and careerism. </p>\r\n<p>As the tendency towards reformism became more marked in the S.D.A.P.. Gorter exposed the capitalistic compromises and treacheries of the S.D.A.P. and the fight became very sharp. A marxist group was formed within the S.D.A.P., but most of this group was expelled in 1909 and formed a Marxist party under the title of the <a href=\"../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp\">SPD</a> (Sozialistische Partei Deutschlands, Social-Democratic Party) . Gorter joined the SDP. </p>\r\n<p>That year the SDP published Gorter&#8217;s work, <em>Marxism and Revisionism, </em>defending Marxist ideas against Bernsteinian revisionism, and supporting the SDP&#8217;s analysis of capitalist society. At the outbreak of the First World War, the SDP leaders, Winjnkoop and Ravensteijn, were elected to Parliament. The unionised workers of Holland, the mass base of the SDP, were in a majority opposed to &#8220;Prussianism&#8221; and inclined to sympathy with &#8220;allied&#8221; imperialism. As a result of this pressure, Winjnkoop and Ravensteijn upheld the &#8220;allied cause&#8221; in Parliament . </p>\r\n<p>When the world war broke out, Herman Gorter opposed the way in which the leaders of Social Democracy placed itself at the disposal of &#8220;their own&#8221; bourgeoisie. He analysed the causes of the collapse of the socialist movement, in his work, <em>Imperialism, Social Democracy, and World War</em>. </p>\r\n<p>Gorter showed that it made no difference to the workers which of the imperialist alliances won the war. For the workers in all lands the issues remained the same. Imperialism was not destroyed by capitalist wars. There was only one way in which the workers could destroy Imperialism: that was the way of World revolution. </p>\r\n<p>The Russian Revolution of October 1917, found in Gorter an enthusiastic defender. Gorter held that to triumph, the revolution had to be a world revolution. </p>\r\n<p>With his friend, Anton Pannekoek, Gorter analysed the Russian Revolution in terms of historical materialism. They show how this revolution was in part a proletarian, and in part a peasant, and therefore bourgeois revolution. The peasants desired and private property and division of the land. Against 10 million workers, inclined to socialist understanding, there were over 100 million peasants, with capitalistic ideology. If the world revolution all the proletariat came to help, these ten millions would become part of the mighty proletariat that conquered and emancipated the world. But if they world revolution did not come to the aid of the Bolsheviks, then it was determined by the class conditions existing in Russia that a new capitalist period would set in. And the consequence would be that Russia would change from being the centre of world revolution, into a powerful ally of world Capitalism, allied to other capitalist states, in enmity to the working class struggle. </p>\r\n<p>In 1921, Gorter travelled illegally to the Third Congress of the Third International, as a delegate of the K.A.P.D. Lenin had published his work <em>&#8220;Left-Wing&#8221; Communism an Infantile Disorder</em>, cautioning against attempts to replicate the Russian Revolution in Europe without the necessary conditions and preparation. </p>\r\n<p>Gorter opposed the analysis Lenin made in this work. He responded with a pamphlet entitled <em>Open Letter to Comrade Lenin</em> claiming that Lenin&#8217;s strategy of compromise with the peasantry must lead to the failure if applied to Western Europe and therefore undermine the world struggle for socialism. Leninism, he held, would prolong the struggle and increase the cost in suffering and hardship to the workers. </p>\r\n<p>In opposition to what he saw as a Leninist &#8220;dictatorship <em>over</em> the proletariat,&#8221; and reduction of the Communist Parties to &#8220;legal&#8221; parties, Gorter developed left wing tactics anti-Parliamentarism. Gorter saw the construction of workers&#8217; councils (soviets) as an achievement of the workers&#8217; movement itself, not that of theoreticians, and declared that every period of the class struggle has its own laws, according to which the rank-and-file develops its own forces. The workers had discovered that in those countries where they had built parliamentary parties and trade unions, these same organisations opposed every proletarian action. Thus, the shop committee (or council, or soviet) became, in Gorter&#8217;s view, the form in which the proletarian consciousness found its expression. </p>\r\n<p>Gorter thought that Lenin did not understand the different conditions in the West, and, therefore, erred in the tactics he urged on the workers of Western Europe. </p>\r\n<p>Gorter and Pannekoek developed the theoretical statement of the Left Wing. They declared that in the West the proletariat is the only power for revolution, and must grow in class consciousness and power consciousness. Parliamentarism must be destroyed as the safety valve of class society, and trade unions must be repudiated as parliamentarism on the industrial field, an extension bourgeois society. The Left-wing would not except the 21 points for admission to the Communist International, and was expelled. But Gorter viewed the breaking down of the Third International as inevitable, but saw communism as certain to revive and eventually triumph. </p>\r\n<p>Herman Gorter died in Brussels on September 15, 1927. He had gone to Switzerland from his home in Holland to renew his health, but he felt that the end of his life was near, and so he broke off his stay in Switzerland and tried to return home. But he was obliged to break his journey at Brussels, and died the same night in the hotel. He spent his last ten hours making arrangements for his unpublished writings and issuing strict instructions that nobody should speak at his grave.</p>\r\n\r\n"

At university he turned to organising the Yiddish-speaking Jewish working class. He played a prominent role in setting up the Jewish Social Democratic Party (JSDP) on May Day 1905 when it split from the Polish Social Democratic Party (PPSD).</p>\n<p>Although he ceased to be an active member of the JSDP&#8217;s leadership in 1908 when he moved to Vienna, he became a member of the Polish Communist Party in Warsaw in 1920.</p>\n<p>The following year Grossman left the Polish Central Statistical Office where he was in charge of running independent Poland&#8217;s first population census, refusing to go along with reactionary efforts to manipulate the census. He then became a professor at the Free University of Poland where he continued to work on Polish economic history and published several Marxist studies in the history of economic thought. At the same time Grossman was one of the main organisers of the People&#8217;s University. In addition to general educational and cultural activities the People&#8217;s University provided a key forum for open political discussion. Grossman was arrested five times and spent periods ranging up to eight months in prison. Eventually, after a public campaign freed Grossman, he was forced into exile in November 1925.</p>\n<p>Grossman then joined his old mentor in Vienna, Carl Grünberg, at the Institute for Social Research (The Frankfurt Institute). He did not join the German Communist Party but was politically close to it. In his preface to <em>The Law of Accumulation</em> Grossman wrote, &#8220;While Marxists have written extensively on the political revolution, they have neglected to deal theoretically with the economic aspect of the question and have failed to appreciate the true content of Marx&#8217;s theory of breakdown. My sole concern here is to fill this gap in the Marxist tradition.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The Comintern wrongly interpreted Grossman&#8217;s book as suggesting the automatic breakdown of capitalism, and condemned <em>The Law of Accumulation</em>. When the Institute was closed down, Grossmann fled to Paris where he published a study of the origins of the modern scientific worldview, arguing that the technological advances associated with early capitalism provided the foundations for mechanistic scientific theory. </p>\n<p>He also reassessed the sectarian Communist strategy which had prevented a united working class fight against the Nazis in Germany. For a period he was sympathetic to Trotsky&#8217;s explanation of the &#8216;German catastrophe&#8217; and the degeneration of the Russian Revolution.

In 1949 he left to take up a chair in political economy at the University of Leipzig in the Soviet zone of Germany. He joined the Socialist Unity (Communist Party) and identified with the regime.

        "content": "\r\nWriter, historian, revolutionary theorist and activist, anticolonialist, syndicalist activist, campaigner for gay rights, Daniel Guérin was active in many organizations and published in many fields. Those who write about him seldom do justice to this multiplicity of commitment or to what Guérin considered to be the importance of his attempt to reconcile anarchism and marxism and, on a much broader level, the personal and the political.</p>\r\n<p>His second autobiography &#8220;Le feu du sang&#8221; (Paris. Grasset, 1977) was subtitled &#8220;Autobiographie politique et charnelle,&#8221; and asserted the common well of the &#8216;vital force&#8217; which motivated him in both his personal, emotional life and in his socio-political commitments. Thus, in the 1970s, when Guérin campaigned for gay rights, it was through an organization called the Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire.</p>\r\n<p>The identity of &#8216;Daniel Guérin&#8217; &#8211; this &#8216;son of the bourgeoisie&#8217; who &#8216;sought to merge with the people in order ultimately to put himself at the service of the revolution&#8217; (&#8220;Autobiographie de Jeunesse,&#8221; Paris: Belfond, 1972, p.9) was a central concern of his autobiographies, and he was to suffer often from simplistic pigeon-holing. It would not have surprised him to learn that, in different biographical and obituary articles, he was described by a writer in &#8220;Le Monde&#8221; as an anarchist; an anarchist-communist declared his incomprehension of Guérin&#8217;s interest in the individualist Max Stirner; a Trotskyist lamented the fact that Guérin had not been quite Trotskyist enough; and a labour historian neglected any mention of his sexual proclivities and included &#8220;Le Feu du sang&#8221; in the &#8216;sexology&#8217; section of the bibliography.</p>\r\n<p>Guérin was born of a liberal, humanist, pro-Dreyfus family of the Left Bank, a very upper-class family with connections in banking, industry, commerce, transport and publishing. In 1927 he finally escaped a restrictive family life by going to Syria and the Lebanon to work as a bookseller, and his long stay there, combined with a three-month visit to Indo-China, convinced him of the injustices of French colonialism.</p>\r\n<p>On his return to France in 1930 he contributed articles on the subject to H. Barbusse&#8217;s &#8220;Monde,&#8221; and was later to be an active member of F. Jourdain&#8217;s Comité d'Amnistie aux Indochinois.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, he became involved with the revolutionary syndicalists around Pierre Monatte, contributing articles to &#8220;La Révolution Prolétarienne&#8221; and &#8220;Le Cri du Peuple,&#8221; and involving himself in the campaign for the reunification of the CGT and the Communist-controlled CGTU. He joined the Belleville group of the Socialist Party (SFIO), but resigned again because of the anti-communism of certain municipal councillors.</p>\r\n<p>After visits to Germany in 1932 and 1933 Guérin wrote his studies of nazism and fascism, &#8220;La Peste brune&#8221; and &#8220;Fascisme et grand capital.&#8221; In 1932 Guérin joined the Syndicat des Correcteurs, and was to remain a lifelong member. The following year, he was a co-founder of the Centre Laïque des Auberges de la Jeunesse.</p>\r\n<p>In October 1935 Guérin re-joined the SFIO, and became a member of the recently-created Gauche Révolutionnaire (revolutionary left) tendency led by M. Pivert. He was to hold several posts, and clashed not only with the Communists over their attempts to dominate trade union activities, but also with Marius Moutet, the SFIO minister for the colonies, and with M. Paz, secretary of the SFIO&#8217;s colonies committee.</p>\r\n<p>In January 1938 the Gauche Révolutionnaire gained control of the SFIO&#8217;s Seine Federation, and Guérin became one of the assistant secretaries. When the tendency was expelled from the SFIO (Royan Congress 1938), and the Parti Socialiste Ouvrier et Paysan was created, Guérin joined the new party, remaining firmly attached to the principles of revolutionary defeatism and proletarian internationalism. He had links with Trotsky, whilst disagreeing with him over the creation of a Fourth International.</p>\r\n<p>Guérin had attended the International Congresses in Brussels (October 1938) and Paris (Apnl 1939) of the Front Ouvrier International, and had been delegated by it to establish a secretariat in Oslo if war broke out. This he did, and he produced a monthly bulletin from October 1939 to April 1940, when he was arrested by the German army and taken to Germany. He managed to return to France in 1942 and was involved in an underground Trotskyist organization.</p>\r\n<p>For just over two years, 1946-9, Guérin lived in the USA, and on his return produced the two-volume study &#8220;Où va le peuple américain?&#8221; (Paris: Julliard, 1950 and 1951), parts of which were later republished as more specific studies on the American labour movement, the position of black Americans and economic concentration.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the 1950s Guérin was heavily involved in anticolonial agitation. In 1952 he travelled to the Maghreb and established contact with syndicalist and nationalist militants there. From 1953 to 1955 he was a member of the Comité France-Maghreb led by F. Mauriac. In 1960 he was one of the first signatories of the &#8216;Appeal of the 121&#8217; calling for the right not to fight in the Algerian War, and in 1963 he presented a report to President Ben Bella on Algerian self-management After the coup of 1965, he helped found the committee which supported Ben Bella and opposed political repression in Algeria. He was also behind the creation of a committee to establish the truth about the disappearance of Moroccan leader Ben Barka in 1965.</p>\r\n<p>Guérin&#8217;s ideas regarding socialism evolved significantly from the 1950s. In 1955-7 he was active in the Nouvelle Gauche led by, among others, C. Bourdet; in 1957 this merged with the Mouvement de Libération du Peuple to become the Union de la Gauche Socialiste, then the Parti Socialiste Unifié. In May-June 1968 Guérin led open debates on self-management in the Sorbonne and in an occupied factory. The following year he joined G. Fontenis&#8217; Mouvement Communiste Libertaire, later to become the Organisation Communiste Libertaire, and he was responsible for its organ, &#8220;Guerre de Classes.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In 1973 he joined the Organisation Révolutionnalre Anarchiste, and wrote for its paper, Front Libertaire. His evolution towards what he called libertarian communism &#8211; an attempted reconciliation of anarchism and Marxism (see &#8220;A la recherche d'un communisme libertaire,&#8221; Paris: Spartacus, 1984) &#8211; led him to become a member of the Union des Travailleurs Communistes Libertaires in 1980.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See the <a href=\"../../../history/etol/writers/guerin/index.htm\" target=_top>Guerin Archive</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"transcriber\">By David Berry, &#8216;Daniel Guérin&#8217; in David Bell, Douglas Johnson and Peter Morris (eds.), A Biographical Dictionary of French Political Leaders since 1870 (London: Harvester Press for the Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France, 1990), p.191-3. <a href=\"https://www.danielguerin.info/tiki-index.php?page=EN+Against+all+forms+of+oppression\">https://www.danielguerin.info/tiki-index.php?page=EN+Against+all+forms+of+oppression</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His positions put him at odds with the party line of the Cuban CP. In 1965, Che realized that the defence of the Cuban revolution and the creation of revolutions abroad were naturally not always in sync, and this ultimately led to his <a href=\"../../../archive/guevara/1965/04/01.htm\" target=\"_top\">resignation</a> and his return to revolutionary work abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> During Che's subsequent revolutionary campaigns, he wrote his <a href=\"../../../archive/guevara/1967/04/16.htm\" target=\"_top\">Message to the Tricontinental</a> (1967) in which he openly criticized the Soviet Union; claiming that the Northern hemisphere of the world, both the Soviet Union and the US, exploited the Southern hemisphere of the world.

His masterpiece was his 1885 &#8220;Esquisse d&#8217;une morale sans obligation ni sanction,&#8221; (Sketch of a Morality Without Obligation or Sanction), which posited a morality free of any artificially imposed notions. The book was admired by Nietzsche, whose copy of the book was covered with annotations.  </p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/guyau/index.htm\">Jean-Marie Guyau Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nBritish biologist, philosopher of science and Marxist.</p>\r\n<p>Haldane was born into an aristocratic intellectual Scottish family, educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford. His father was a scientist, a philosopher and a liberal, but his mother was an ardent Tory. During the First World War, he served with the Black Watch in France and Iraq, and whilst in the army, became a socialist.</p>\r\n<p>Between 1919 and 1922 he was a fellow of New College, then moved to Cambridge University until 1932. He then moved to University College, London where he spent most of the remainder of his academic career. In 1924, Haldane met Charlotte Burghes (née Franken) and the two later married. </p>\r\n<p>In his earliest excursions into the realm of the philosophy of science, Haldane had held while materialism had been the most appropriate philosophy for the science of the Newtonian era, Kantianism was the appropriate philosophy of science of the Einsteinian era, for which the laws of natural science were merely forms of human perception. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut in 1928, Haldane, went to the Soviet Union, where he encountered Marxist philosophy of science for the first time, although it would be several years yet before he would come to embrace it as his own. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis father, John Scott Haldane, had also indulged in philosophical speculation on the natural sciences, somewhat along Hegelian lines, he sought to undermine materialism as a philosophy of science. JBS took the further step from Hegel to Marx, but saw his work as a continuation of his father&#8217;s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJBS Haldane&#8217;s famous book, <em>The Causes of Evolution</em> (1932), was a major work of what came to be known as the &#8220;modern evolutionary synthesis,&#8221; re-establishing natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of Mendelian genetics.</p>\r\n<p>As one of many &#8220;fellow-travellers&#8221; of the Communist Party among the British intelligentsia in the 1930s, he wrote many articles for <em>The Daily Worker</em>, but only joined the Communist party in 1937. He left in 1950, shortly after having considered standing as a Communist Party candidate for Parliament. The rise of Lysenko&#8217;s pseudo-science, with the overt support of Stalin was the principal factor which turned Haldane away from the Communist Party.</p>\r\n<p>In his essay,<em> On Being the Right Size</em>, Haldane put forward the thesis that the simple <em>size</em> of an animal determined much of its nature: &#8220;Insects, being so small, do not have oxygen-carrying bloodstreams. What little oxygen their cells require can be absorbed by simple diffusion of air through their bodies. But being larger means an animal must take on complicated oxygen pumping and distributing systems to reach all the cells.&#8221; This idea has been referred to as &#8220;Haldane&#8217;s principle.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Haldane was friends with the author Aldous Huxley, and was the basis for the biologist Shearwater in Huxley&#8217;s novel <em>Antic Hay</em>. Ideas from Haldane&#8217;s <a href=\"../../../archive/haldane/works/1920s/daedalus.htm\" target=\"_top\">Daedalus, or, Science and the Future</a>, written before Haldane had visited the Soviet Union, such as ectogenesis (the development of foetuses in artificial wombs), also influenced Huxley&#8217;s <em>Brave New World</em>.</p>\r\n<p>In one of the last speeches of his life, <em>Biological Possibilities for the Human Species of the Next Ten Thousand Years</em> in 1963, he coined the word &#8220;clone,&#8221; from the Greek word for twig.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/haldane/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">J B S Haldane Archive </a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The group intended to form a military organization to wage guerrilla warfare in the countryside. However, the group was discovered by the secret police, SAVAK, that had infiltrated a spy into the group. However, the identity of Hamid Ashraf and some other members was not revealed to the police so that he, and other survivors, reorganized the group that finally planned attacking a gendarmerie police station in Siahkal, Gilan Province, on February 8, 1971.

During his six-year clandestine life, he frequently escaped sieges and traps set by the secret police. He actually turned into the fabulous commander of the guerrilla movement &#8211; a myth embraced by a generation of young political activists.

Hamid Ashraf was both the leader of the organization and the commander of military operations. He was very brave and experienced and personally participated in some assassinations and had escaped conflicts even when surrounded by police on several occasions.

He's also known for his involvement in the founding of the Rainbow Coalition, an organization uniting poor people across racial barriers. Within the Coalition were the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican group; the Young Patriots, a white Appalachian migrant group; the Black Panthers; and more.\n</p>\n<p>\nDue to his prolific success in his organizing and his exemplary oratory skills, Hampton attracted the ire of Chicago Police and became a central target of the FBI's COINTELPRO (Counter Intelligence Program), a covert and illegal project aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political organizations. Through this program the Chicago FBI office recruited William O'Neal, twice arrested for interstate car theft and the impersonation of a federal officer, to infiltrate  the BPP as a counterintelligence operative. O'Neal's successful infiltration led to his becoming the Chicago BPP's Director of security and Hampton's personal bodyguard.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn December 4th, officers assigned to Cook County State's Attorney Edward Hanrahan raided a home associated with the Fred Hampton and Black Panther Party with a warrant in search of illegal weapons. When the FBI's COINTELPRO became public knowledge, it was revealed that the raid had been organized in collaboration with the FBI to explicitly target Hampton for assassination. O'Neal aided the raid by poisoning Fred Hampton with a sleep agent and providing the FBI and Chicago Police with schematics of the home and information on where to find a sedated Hampton &#8212; who was shot and murdered in his sleep.\n</p>\n<p>\nFour weeks after witnessing Hampton's death at the hands of the police, Deborah Johnson&#8212;Hampton's fianc&eacute;e&#8212;gave birth to their son Fred Hampton Jr.  A year later, survivors of the raid along with relatives of Hampton filed a civil suit seeking $47.7 million in damages.

One of his tutors was the famous William Chillingworth. After several years spent travelling, and a period as a soldier in the Dutch army, he returned to England and lived quietly till 1646, when he was appointed to accompany King Charles I, who was being taken from Newcastle as a prisoner. Though republican in his ideas, Harrington won the king&#8217;s regard and esteem, and accompanied him to the Isle of Wight. He aroused the suspicion of the parliamentarians and was dismissed: it is said that he was punished for declining to swear to refuse assistance to the king should he attempt to escape.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter Charles&#8217;s death Harrington devoted his time to the composition of his <em>Oceana</em>, a work which pleased no one. By order of Oliver Cromwell, it was seized when passing through the press. Harrington, however managed to secure the favour of the Protector&#8217;s favourite daughter, Mrs Claypole; the work was restored to him, and appeared in 1656, dedicated to Cromwell. The views embodied in Oceana, particularly that bearing on vote by ballot and rotation of magistrates and legislators, Harrington and others (who in 1659 formed a club called the &#8220;Rota&#8221;) endeavoured to push practically, but with no success.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn November 1661, by order of Charles II, Harrington was arrested on a charge of conspiracy, and was thrown into the Tower of London. Despite his repeated request no public trial took place, and when at length his sisters obtained a writ of habeas corpus he was secretly moved to St Nicholas Island off Plymouth. There his health gave way owing to his drinking guaiacum on medical advice, and his mind appeared to be affected. Careful treatment restored him to bodily vigour, but his mind never wholly recovered. Some time after his release he married &#8211; the date does is not known. Following his death, he was buried next to Sir Walter Raleigh in St Margaret&#8217;s, Westminster.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHarrington&#8217;s writings consist of the <em>Oceana</em>, and of papers, pamphlets, aphorisms, even treatises, in defence of the <em>Oceana</em>. His Works were edited with biography by John Toland in 1700; Toland&#8217;s edition, with additions by Thomas Birch, appeared in 1747, and again in 1771. Oceana was reprinted by Henry Morley in 1887. See Dwight in <em>Political Science Quarterly</em> (March, 1887).

His parents were poor and at the age of nine he began work down a mine in Winnemucca, Nevada. While working as a miner Haywood met Pat Reynolds, a member of the <a href=\"../../orgs/k/n.htm#knights-of-labor\">Knights of Labor</a>. Reynolds was to have a lasting influence on Haywood&#8217;s political views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1896 Haywood found work in the Blaine mine in Silver City, Idaho, and soon afterwards joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/w/e.htm#wfm\">Western Federation of Miners</a> (WFM). Haywood became active in the union campaigns to increase wages and to bring an end to child labour in the mines. In 1901 Haywood was elected secretary-treasurer of the WFM. Later that year he joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america\">American Socialist Party</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haywood also edited the Miners&#8217; Magazine, the journal of the WFM, and he used this position to promote the idea of socialism and argued that America should become a cooperative commonwealth. Other trade union leaders such as  <a href=\"../d/e.htm#debs-eugene\">Eugene V. Debs</a> and <a href=\"../d/e.htm#de-leon-daniel\">Daniel De Leon</a> were also converted to socialism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haywood and his political friends were unhappy with the conservative approach of the American Federation of Labor and on 27th June, 1905, they held a meeting in Chicago. Those who attended the meeting included Eugene V. Debs, Daniel De Leon, <a href=\"../j/o.htm#jones-mother\">Mother Jones</a>, <a href=\"../p/a.htm#parsons-lucy\">Lucy Parsons</a> and Charles Moyer. At the convention it was decided to form the radical labor organisation, the <a href=\"../../../history/usa/unions/iww/index.htm\">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1905 Haywood was charged with taking part in the murder of Frank R. Steunenberg, the former governor of Idaho. Steunenberg was much hated by the trade union movement after using federal troops to help break strikes during his period of office. Over a thousand trade unionists and their supporters were rounded up and kept in stockades without trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James McParland, from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, was called in to investigate the murder. McParland was convinced from the beginning that the leaders of the Western Federation of Miners had arranged the killing of Steunenberg. McParland arrested Harry Orchard, a stranger who had been staying at a local hotel. In his room they found dynamite and some wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McParland helped Orchard to write a confession that he had been a contract killer for the WFM, assuring him this would help him get a reduced sentence for the crime. In his statement, Orchard named Hayward and Charles Moyer (president of WFM). He also claimed that a union member from Caldwell, George Pettibone, had also been involved in the plot. These three men were arrested and were charged with the murder of Steunenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charles Darrow, a man who specialized in defending trade union leaders, was employed to defend Hayward, Moyer and Pettibone. The trial took place in Boise, the state capital. It emerged that Harry Orchard already had a motive for killing Steunenberg, blaming the governor of Idaho, for destroying his chances of making a fortune from a business he had started in the mining industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the three month trial, the prosecutor was unable to present any information against Hayward, Moyer and Pettibone except for the testimony of Orchard and were all acquitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1908 the Wobblies, as they became known, split into two factions. The group headed by Eugene V. Debs advocated political action through the Socialist Party and the trade union movement, to attain its goals. The other faction, led by Haywood, believed that general strikes, boycotts and even sabotage were justified in order to achieve its objectives. Haywood&#8217;s views prevailed and Debs, and others who thought like him, left the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haywood remained active in the Socialist Party and was seen as the leader of the radical left. Eventually, in 1912 Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit, the leaders of the right-wing, gained control and expelled Haywood and his followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 1912 the America Woolen Company reduced the wages of its workers. This caused a walk-out and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), who had been busy recruiting workers into the union, took control of the dispute. The IWW formed a strike committee with two representatives from each of the nationalities in the industry. It was decided to demand a 15 per cent increase in wages, double-time for overtime work and a 55 hour week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haywood, <a href=\"../t/r.htm#tresca\">Carlo Tresca</a> and <a href=\"../f/l.htm#flynn-elizabeth-gurley\">Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</a> now arrived in Lawrence and took over the running of the strike. On 12th March, 1912, the America Woolen Company acceded to all the strikers&#8217; demands. By the end of the month, the rest of the other textile companies in Lawrence also agreed to pay the higher wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1913 Haywood and the Industrial Workers of the World helped organize the silk workers at the Paterson Silk Mills. During the dispute over 3,000 pickets were arrested, most of them received a 10 day sentence in local jails. Two workers were killed by private detectives hired by the mill workers. These men were arrested but were never brought to trial. However, the strike fund was unable to raise enough money and in July, 1913, the workers were starved into submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the events <a href=\"../../events/w/o.htm#ww1\">First World War</a> the Industrial Workers of the World opposed United States participation in the conflict. After United States entered the war in 1917, its leaders, including Haywood, were arrested under the Espionage Act. Haywood was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a fine of $30,000, however, released on bail during the appeal, Haywood fled to <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-government\">Russia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1920, the <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international\">Communist International</a> addressed an Open Letter to the IWW invited them to join the Comintern. Hayward said of this letter: &#8216;After I had finished reading it I called Ralph Chaplin and said to him: \"Here is what we have been dreaming about; here is the IWW all feathered out!\"&#8217;. Haywood went to the USSR to escape repression, \"to end his days in the stuffy rooms of the Lux Hotel, among Marxists, not one of whom tried to understand him\" (Serge).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian government placed Haywood in charge of the Kuzbas coal-mining colony. His heath was poor and William D. Haywood died in Moscow on 18th May, 1928. His autobiography, Bill Haywood&#8217;s Book (1929) was published after his death. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/</p>\r\n\r\n"

It was essentially idealist and the main point in this case was the elaboration of a world outlook that was more materialist than any previous one. Hegel's method took as its point of departure pure thought, whereas here the starting point was to be inexorable facts.A method which, according to its own admission, \"came from nothing, through nothing, to nothing\" [Hegel, <em>Science of Logic</em>, Part I, Section 2] was by no means appropriate here in this form. Nevertheless, of all the available logical material, it was the only piece which could be used, at least, as a starting-point. It had not been criticised, nor overcome; not one of the opponents of the great dialectician had been able to make a breach in its proud structure; it fell into oblivion, because the Hegelian school had not the slightest notion what to do with it. It was, therefore, above all necessary to subject the Hegelian method to through-going criticism.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"What distinguished Hegel's mode of thought from that of all other philosophers was the tremendous sense of the historical upon which it was based. Abstract and idealist though it was in form, yet the development of his thoughts always proceeded parallel with the development of world history and the latter is really meant to be only the test of the former. If, thereby, the real relation was inverted and stood on its head, nevertheless, the real content entered everywhere into the philosophy; all the more so since Hegel- in contrast to his disciples- did not parade ignorance, but was one of the finest intellects of all time. He was the first who attempted to show a development, an inner coherence, in history; and while today much in his philosophy of history may seem peculiar to us, yet the grandeur of his fundamental outlook is admirable even today, whether one makes comparison with his predecessors or, to be sure, with anyone who, since his time, has indulged n general reflections concerning history. Everywhere, in his <em>Phenomenlogy, Esthetics, History of Philosophy</em>, this magnificent conception of history prevails, and everywhere the material is treated historically, in a definite, even if abstractly distorted, interconnection with history.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"This epoch-making conception of history was the direct theoretical premise for the new materialist outlook, and this alone provide a connecting point for the logical method, too. Since this forgotten dialectics had lead to such results even from the standpoint of \"pure thinking\", and had, in addition, so easily settled accounts with all preceding logic and metaphysics, there must at any rate have been more to it than sophistry and hair-splitting. But the criticism of this method, which all official philosophy had fought shy of an still does, was no trifle.\n</p>\n<p>\nMarx later wrote in his <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm\" target=\"_top\">preface to the second edition</a> of Capital (Volume 1):\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which, under the name of \"the Idea,\" he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of \"the Idea.\" With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought. \n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n  \"The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>See:</em> <strong><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hegel/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Hegel Reference Archive</a></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n"

He held that the distinction between subject and object, the separation between man and his environment, is not immediate but comes only later as a result of conceptualisation. To get back to &#8220;Thinking of Being&#8221; Heidegger employed linguistic techniques, developing words of his own invention, not only from German, but even from Greek.</p>\n<p>\nWhen Hitler assumed power in November 1933, German universities were pressured to eliminate Jewish scholars and &#8220;Jewish Doctrines&#8221;, such as relativity! The anti-Nazi Rector at Freiburg resigned in protest, and the teaching staff unanimously elected Heidegger as his successor. In his inauguration speech Heidegger gave a clear affirmation of Nazism. Heidegger also gave solidly pro-Hitler speeches on subsequent occasions: &#8220;The F&uuml;hrer himself and he alone is the German reality, present and future, and its law.&#8221;.</p>\n<p>\nHeidegger joined the Nazi Party and did not try to leave it, but his relations with the party deteriorated. He resigned as rector at the beginning of 1934 but only denounced the Nazis after the war was over. At the de-nazification hearings at Freiburg University in 1945 found that he &#8220;made an essential contribution to the legitimation of this revolution in the eyes of educated Germans.&#8221;  As a result he was banned from teaching at the universtity level.  The ban was lifted in 1951.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heidegge.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Basic Problems of Phenomenonology</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n"

Following Pauli to the University of G&ouml;ttingen, he studied there under <a href=\"../b/o.htm#born-max\">Max Born</a> and in 1924 went to study under Niels Bohr in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>\nHeisenberg was aware of growing problems with Bohr's model of the atom and wanted to develop a new model to cope with the growing contradictions.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1925, Heisenberg solved problem of how to account for the discrete energy states of an anharmonic oscillator which opened the way for an alternative explanation of the discrete energy levels founds in Bohr's model of the atom and a new interpretation of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg took as unobservable the supposed trajectory of a particle between its interactions in order to be able to construct a theory which deal only with the measurable interaction events. Consequently, physical variables would be represented by discrete <em>arrays</em> of numbers. Under the influence of <a href=\"../e/i.htm#einstein-albert\">Albert Einstein</a>'s paper on relativity, he took the variables to represent only <em>measurable</em> quantities. Born showed that these arrays obeyed the rules of <em>matrix algebra</em>, and with Heisenberg, named the new quantum theory &#8220;matrix mechanics&#8221;. Each matrix specified the possible values for a physical variable, and the terms of a matrix were taken to generate probabilities of occurrences of states and transitions. Using the matrix mechanics to interpret the spectrum of the helium atom and other atomic and molecular spectra, ferromagnetic phenomena, and electromagnetic behaviour, Heisenberg demonstrated the validity of the conception experimentally.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1927, Heisenberg published the Indeterminacy, or Uncertainty, Principle in which he endeavoured to relate the matrix-entities to the intuitively familiar concepts of classical physics. If <em>q</em> is the position-coordinate of an electron, and <em>p</em> a measurement of its momentum, then delta-<em>q</em> * delta-<em>p</em> &gt; <em>h</em> (Planck's constant), where delta-<em>q</em> and delta-<em>p</em> are the standard deviation of measurements of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. One of the characteristics of matrix algebra is that the <em>law of commutation for multiplication</em> does not hold (a*b not= b*a). Momentum and position are thus characterised as \"non-commuting variables\", from which it follows that the determination of each of the two variables cannot be deemed to make sense <em>independently</em> of one another, the two entities cannot have a separate meaning independent of one another; the Indeterminacy Principle stated above gives a definite quantitative measure to this degree of interdependence. This conception has a close parallel to Einstein's discovery that measurements of space and time cannot be conceived of measuring entities <em>independent</em> of one another.</p>\n<p>\nThis result has been interpreted by subjectivist writers to mean that in some way what is at issue is the Mind of the person carrying out the measurement which is determining the interaction, but this idea hinges on a total misunderstanding of the issue. The problem for conception of these processes arises from the fact that for everyday, pictorial thinking, position and momentum are <em>distinct</em> entities; in relation to quantum phenomena, these concepts are meaningful only in relation to interactions of a particle, and quite distinct interactions are implied in the measurement of momentum or position. This is not at all the case in everday experience.</p>\n<p>\nInitially, Heisenberg had arrived at the matrix-mechanics through the solution of mathematical problems and did not see the matrices as representations of particulate properties such as momentum and position. It was Bohr who showed how the Indeterminacy Principle expressed the relationship between the wave and particle conceptions of quantum phenomena and gave a quantitative expression to the Complementarity Principle.</p>\n<p>\nBohr and Heisenberg generalised the principle of complementarity to take account of a range of physical variables and the measurement process on which each depends. The principle and the difficulties which flow from its interpretation, was the subject of intense controversy among all the great physicists of that time, with Einstein, Schr&ouml;dinger and Louis de Broglie all disputing Bohr and Heisenberg's interpretation of the principle of complementarity. </p>\n<p>\nFrom 1927 to 1941 Heisenberg worked at the University of Leipzig and from 1941 to 1945 in Berlin. He never publicly opposed the Nazi regime and worked with Otto Hahn on the development of a nuclear reactor though he failed to develop an effective program for nuclear weapons. After the war he became director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics at G&ouml;ttingen, moving with the institute to Munich.</p>\n<p>\nAfter the War Heisenberg began work on spinors, complex vector-like representations, hoping to find universal symmetries in nature whcih would explain the wide variety of elementary particles.</p>\n<p>\nAlthough he early, and indirectly, came under the influence of <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst\">Ernst Mach</a>, Heisenberg, in his philosophical writings about quantum mechanics, vigorously opposed the Logical Positivism developed by philosophers of science of the <a href=\"../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle\">Vienna Circle</a>. According to Heisenberg, what was revealed by active observation was not an absolute datum, but a theory-laden datum, contextualized by observational situations. He took classical mechanics and electromagnetics, which articulated the objective motions of bodies in space-time, to be permanently valid, though not applicable to quantum mechanical interactions; he took causality to apply in general not to individual quantum mechanical systems but to mathematical representations alone, since particle behaviour could be predicted only on the basis of probability. </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\nSee his <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heisenb2.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">History of Quantum Theory</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\n<p>\nOne of the greatest scientists of the 19th century, made fundamental contributions to physiology, optics, electrodynamics, mathematics, and meteorology, but best known for his statement of the law of the conservation of energy and his successful struggle against vitalism; in attempting to develop a consistent empiricism, he formulated an epistemology based on a conception of sensations as &#8216;symbols&#8217; of external reality: &#8220;as the quality of our sensations informs us of the properties of external action by which this sensation is produced, the latter can be regarded as its <em>sign</em>, but not as its <em>image</em>&#8221;.</p>\n<p>\nA sickly child, his father who was a teacher of philosophy and literature at the Potsdam Gymnasium, taught him Greek, Latin, French, English, and Italian, and the philosophy of Kant and Fichte at a young age. Much of Helmholtz's later work was devoted to refuting the &#8220;Nature Philosophy&#8221; he had been taught by his father.</p>\n<p>\nHe attended the Friedrich Wilhelm Medical Institute in Berlin under the great physiologist, Johannes M&uuml;ller, receiving a free medical education on the condition that he serve eight years as an army doctor. He also attended the lectures in physics and worked his way through higher mathematics from the textbooks, and taught himself the piano.</p>\n<p>\nShortly after graduating however, he was relieved from military duties and soon became assistant professor and director of the Physiological Institute in K&ouml;nigsberg and in 1855 was appointed professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn. More and more his interests moved towards physics, and in 1882 he was elevated to the nobility and in 1888, appointed director of the Physico-Technical Institute at Berlin, where he spent the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p>\nOne of the central interests of the latter part of the nineteenth century was investigation of the relationship between human beings and Nature by means of studying the physiology of perception. The majority of biologists of his day believed in the existence of a <em>life force</em> of some kind, inhabiting the bodies of living beings and responsible for their vitality. From an early age, Helmholtz set himself not only to dispense with this <em>vitalism</em>, but also to disprove <a href=\"../../people/k/a.htm#kant-immanuel\">Immanuel Kant&#8217;s</a> idea of the <em>innate faculties</em> of Reason. Helmholtz insisted that <em>all</em> knowledge came through the senses, and he rejected all forms of deduction of natural law from philosophical considerations and conceptions of mystical &#8220;life forces.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\nAt the beginning of his career in Johannes M&uuml;ller's laboratory, Helmholtz determined himself to tackle the problem of uncovering the physical and chemical processes at work in living organisms. His doctoral thesis on the connection between nerve fibres and nerve cells soon led him to the problem of explaining the generation of animal heat on the basis of basic physics and chemistry, intending in this way to absolutely refute the doctrines of vitalism, which held that body heat was derived from the action of the &#8220;life force.&#8221; His general considerations in preparing this work led to his formulation of the Law of Conservation of Energy (&#8216;Force&#8217; as he called it). His paper, published in 1847, marked an epoch in the history of natural science. In 1850, Helmholtz succeeded in measuring the speed of transmission of nerve impulses at 27 metres per second, an observation which contributed to undermining vitalism.</p>\n<p>\nWith painstakingly detailed investigation of the mechanisms of sight, and later studies of the sensations of audible tones, Helmholtz intended to undermine Kant's conception of the innate comprehension of space and time, and he published a number of exemplary works on the physiology of sight and hearing.</p>\n<p>\nHelmholtz showed exactly how the sense of vision created the idea of space. Space, according to Helmholtz, was a learned, not an inherent, concept. Moreover, Helmholtz also attacked Kant's insistence that space was necessarily three-dimensional because that was how the mind had to conceive it. Using his considerable mathematical talents, he investigated the properties of non-Euclidean space and showed that these could be conceived and worked with as easily as the geometry of three dimensions.</p>\n<p>\nHelmholtz's mathematical talents were exceptional. He attacked and solved equations that had long frustrated physicists and mathematicians. In 1858 he published the paper <span class=\"book\">On the Integrals of Hydrodynamic Equations to Which Vortex Motions Conform</span>. This was not only a mathematical triumph, but also seemed to provide a key to the fundamental structure of matter. One of the consequences that flowed from Helmholtz's mathematical analysis was that vortices of an ideal fluid were amazingly stable; they could collide elastically with one another, intertwine to form complex knot-like structures, and undergo tensions and compressions, all without losing their identities. In 1866, Kelvin proposed that these vortices, if composed of the ether that was presumed to be the basis for optical, electrical, and magnetic phenomena, could act exactly like primeval atoms of solid matter. Thus the ether would become the only substance in the cosmos, and all physical phenomena could be accounted for in terms of its properties.</p>\n<p>\nHelmholtz also did significant work on the mathematics of electrodynamics and spent his last years unsuccessfully trying to reduce all of electrodynamics to a minimum set of mathematical principles, an attempt in which he had to rely increasingly on the supposed mechanical properties of the ether.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1881, in a lecture delivered in London, Helmholtz argued for the particulate nature of electricity, leading to the coining of the word &#8220;electron&#8221;. Helmholtz came close to his goal of deducing all electromagnetic effects from properties of the ether, using his vortex hypothesis, and the discovery of radio waves by Hertz in 1888 was seen as confirmation of his theory. Ultimately, Helmholtz's theories were rendered obsolete by Einstein's theory of special and general relativity, after which the concept of &#8220;ether&#8221; was abandoned.</p>\n<p>\nHelmholtz's work was the end product of the development of classical mechanics. He pushed it as far as it could go. When Helmholtz died in Berlin in 1894, the world of physics was poised on the brink of revolution. The discovery of X rays, radioactivity, and relativity led to a new kind of physics in which Helmholtz' achievements, although impressive, had little to offer.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\nSee his speech, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/helmholt.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Facts of Perception</span></a>, summarising his epistemological views.\n</p>\n\n\n\n"

An invariant is that aspect of something which remains the same when a corresponding transformation is applied to something. The meaning of <em>invariant</em> is most easily understood in terms of geometrical transformations such as displacement (where shape and size are invariant) or dilation (where shape but not size are invariant).

His new method allowed him to produce a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry which marked a turning point in the theory of axioms. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nMuch of Hilbert's fame rests on a list of 23 unsolved problems of mathematics he enunciated in Paris in 1900 in an address published as <span class=\"book\">The Problems of Mathematics</span>. Many of the problems have since been solved, and each solution has been an &#8216;event&#8217;. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOver the first two decades of the twentieth century, Hilbert struggled to construct an axiomatic foundation for mathematics for which he could prove that a finite number of steps of reasoning could not lead to a contradiction.

Nevertheless, the development of logic after Hilbert was different, for he established the formalistic foundations of mathematics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHilbert's name is given to Infinite-Dimensional space, called <em>Hilbert space</em>, used as a conception for the mathematical anaysis of the kinetic gas theory and the theory of radiations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/hilbert.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Foundations of Mathematics</span></a>, 1927.

        "content": "\r\nMarxist historian whose radical interpretation of the 17th century changed the way we think about the English revolution .</p>\r\n<p>\r\nChristopher Hill was the commanding interpreter of 17th-century England, and of much else besides. As a public figure, he achieved his greatest fame as master of Balliol College, Oxford, a post he held from 1965 until 1978. Yet it was as the defining Marxist historian of the century of revolution, the title of one of the most widely studied of his many books, that he became known to generations of students around the world. For all these, too, he will always be the master. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt would be a pardonable exaggeration to say that Hill created the way in which the people of late 20th-century Britain &#8211; and the left in particular &#8211; looked at the history of 17th-century England. As he never tired of pointing out, some of the themes he illuminated so richly had already been explored by left-wing scholars in the 1930s. But from 1940, when he published his tercentenary essay, <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../archive/hill-christopher/english-revolution/index.htm\">The English Revolution 1640</a></span>, his own voluminously expanding and unfailingly literate work became the starting point of most subsequent interpretation, even for those who rejected his method and conclusions. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo historian of recent times was so synonymous with his period of study; he is the reason why most of us know anything about the 17th century at all. He was, EP Thompson once said, the dean and paragon of English historians. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHill was born in York, where his father was a solicitor. His parents were Methodists, a fact to which he attributed his lifelong political and intellectual apostasy. Though his life was to be the embodiment of a secularised form of dissent, his high moral seriousness and egalitarianism surely had roots in this radical Protestant background. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt St Peter's school in York, his academic prowess was immediately evident. It is said that, when Hill was 16, the two Balliol dons &#8211; Vivien Galbraith and Kenneth Bell &#8211; who marked his entrance papers agreed to award him 100%, before travelling to York to capture him for the college and prevent him going any further with a Cambridge application. Galbraith, in particular, was to remain an immense influence. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHill's association with Balliol was to continue, with only brief interruptions, from his arrival as an undergraduate in 1931 until his retirement as master 47 years later. Academic honours regularly fell his way, starting with the prestigious Lothian prize in 1932, and continuing with a first-class degree in 1934 and an All Souls fellowship that winter. But he was a successful rugby player too, the scorer of a famous cup-winning try for Balliol. Even more lastingly, he had become a Marxist. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nExactly when and why this happened is uncertain, since Hill was always notoriously inscrutable about discussing his personal life. He once claimed it came about through trying to make sense of the 17th-century metaphysical poets, but although he read Marx as an undergraduate, the moment of his conversion to communism is elusive. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis contemporary, RW Southern, once teasingly remembered &#8220;a time when Christopher was not in the least bit leftish\", but Hill was an undergraduate during the period of the great depression, the hunger marches, the New Deal, Hitler's rise (he visited the Weimar Republic before going up to Oxford), and the first (favourable) impact of Stalin in the west. He was a regular attender at GDH Cole's Thursday Lunch Club, where, as he once put it, &#8220;I was forced to ask questions about my own society which had previously not occurred to me.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nCertainly by the time he graduated, Hill had joined the Communist party. In 1935, he spent a year in the Soviet Union, during which he was very ill, but also formed a lasting affection for Russian life &#8211; and a somewhat less lasting one for Soviet politics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter Moscow, he had two years as an assistant lecturer at University College, Cardiff, before returning to Balliol as a fellow and tutor in modern history. In 1940, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, before becoming a major in the intelligence corps and being seconded to the Foreign Office from 1943 until the end of the war. This was, to put it mildly, an intriguing period, about which he rarely let fall much detail. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time, he had begun to publish, at first pseudonymously, articles and reviews which, among other things, did much to draw attention to the burgeoning Soviet school of English 17th-century studies. Then, in 1940, arising out of intensive debate among a group of Marxist historians, who included Leslie Morton, Robin Page Arnot and &#8211; particularly influential on Hill &#8211; Dona Torr, came the decisive The English Revolution 1640. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe essay was originally published as one of a collection of three reflections (the others were by Margaret James and Edgell Rickword). Hill's contribution, which was subsequently published alone, was a no-holds-barred assertion of the revolutionary nature of England between 1640 and 1660, and an assault on the traditional presentation of these years as an aberration in the stately continuity of English history. </p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;I wrote as a very angry young man, believing he was going to be killed in a world war,&#8221; Hill later told an interviewer. The book, he said, &#8220;was written very fast and in a good deal of anger, [and] was intended to be my last will and testament.&#8221; It has rarely, if ever, been out of print since. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe discussions surrounding Hill's essay also produced, in 1946, the Communist Party Historians Group, an association he regarded as &#8220;the greatest single influence&#8221; on his subsequent work. This formidable academy, which included Edmund Dell, Maurice Dobb, Rodney Hilton, Eric Hobsbawm, James Jeffreys, Victor Kiernan, George Rudé, Raphael Samuel, John Saville and Dorothy Thompson, has a good claim to have redefined the study of history in Britain, especially after the launch, in 1952, of the journal <em>Past And Present</em>, of which Hill rapidly became the moving spirit and, later, the doyen. It also generated the path-breaking collection of documents, <em>The Good Old Cause</em>, that he edited with Dell in 1949. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe active, 20-year involvement with communism, which also led to his short biography, <em>Lenin And The Russian Revolution</em> (1947), came to a crisis after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Along with many in the CP, Hill had become disenchanted with the party's lack of democracy and its reluctance to criticise the Soviet Union. Both issues came to a head in the late weeks of 1956, though his own break did not come until the following year. He was appointed to a CP review of inner-party democracy, but the rejection of the critical minority report, written by Hill (with Peter Cadogan and Malcolm MacEwen), precipitated his final departure. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese were watershed years in Hill's personal life too. A wartime marriage to Inez Waugh, the former wife of a colleague, produced a home life which combined the high seriousness of Balliol Marxism with an extravagant bohemianism. It also produced their daughter Fanny Hill, later a dashing figure on the Oxford scene, who drowned off the Spanish coast in her 40s. The marriage collapsed early and, in 1956, he married again, this time to Bridget Sutton, then a history tutor with the Workers' Educational Association in Staffordshire. Turbulence was replaced by the single greatest happiness of Hill's life. With Bridget, he had a son and two daughters, one of whom died in a car accident. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter 1957, Hill's career ascended to new heights as he began the remarkable output of books on which his reputation will rest, and which continued undiminished until he was well into his 80s. Hill always argued that the connection between leaving the CP and his wider fame was post-hoc rather than propter-hoc, and it is certainly true that 1956-57 caused no revolution (let alone a counter-revolution) in his analysis of the English revolution. On the other hand, the Bridget effect can hardly be underestimated. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf the steady flow of books which began with <em>Economic Problems Of The Church</em> (1955) can, to some extent, be seen as a succession of more scholarly explorations of the themes sketched out in the early didactic essays, they also reflect the extraordinary sweep of Hill's interests and mind. Central to the whole project was a patient fascination with religion, represented, in particular, in his attempt to understand the revolutionary power of puritanism. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Hill's explorations were in no way bound by traditional or preconceived theories. The single, most striking and controversial aspect of his method was the way in which he subtly identified intellectual connections, currents and continuities between the most unlikely pieces of evidence &#8211; from scraps of court records to <em>Paradise Lost</em> and <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>. His use of literary sources was one of his most fascinating characteristics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nMany of the tasks he set himself were laid out in his next book, <em>Puritanism And Revolution</em> (1958). They were further explored in <em>Society And Puritanism In Pre-Revolutionary England</em> (1964) and the remarkable <em>Intellectual Origins Of The English Revolution</em> (1965, and extensively revised 31 years later), this last based on his 1962 Ford lectures. Alongside came more popular works of exegesis &#8211; a Historical Association pamphlet on Cromwell (1958), the bestselling (but not adulatory) biography <em>God's Englishman</em> (1970), the textbook <em>The Century Of Revolution</em> (1961) and the hugely successful Penguin economic history, <em>Reformation To Industrial Revolution</em> (1967). </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThose who heard Hill deliver the lectures on which it is based &#8211; lectures delivered in a nervous, slightly stuttering voice &#8211; will always reserve a special place for his 1972 study of radical and millenarian ideas, <em>The World Turned Upside Down</em>. Not only was this one of the very few history books to be turned into a play (at the National theatre), it was also a work made more exciting by the time in which it was written, an era of counter-cultural energy which Hill observed (and quietly celebrated) from the Balliol master's lodgings. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a period of immense academic daring (and, thought some, of over-reaching) as Hill scythed through received tradition in his study of <em>AntiChrist In 17th-century England</em> (1971) and his controversial study of <em>Milton And The English Revolution</em> (1977), which, like many of his later works, was written at the plain but lovely house in Périgord which Bridget badgered him into buying in 1969. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, in 1965, Hill had defeated Ronald Bell in the election for master of Balliol, a success which caused raised eyebrows (it was only 10 years or so since academics with Hill's politics had been, to all intents and purposes, blacklisted from many posts) and much press attention. His tenure was deft and collegiate, and he tried to maintain his teaching and research amid the administrative and ceremonial duties. He never seriously hid his enthusiasm for the two main innovations of his mastership &#8211; the opening of male-only Balliol to women, and the representation of students on the college governing body. &#8220;Common sense varies among the young,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;as among the old.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nRetirement found his productivity undiminished. He moved to Sibford Ferris, on the Cotswold hills, and, for two years, worked as a visiting professor at the Open University, an entirely characteristic effort to bring his learning to a wider audience. Then he settled down to further books: <em>Some Intellectual Consequences Of The English Revolution</em> (1980); <em>The World Of The Muggletonians</em> (1983); and <em>The Experience Of Defeat</em> (1984), an account of the Restoration made poignant by the reverses 20th-century leftwing politics were suffering at the time. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nA marvellously vivid study of Bunyan followed in 1988, before <em>The English Bible In 17th-century England</em> (1993) and <em>Liberty Against The Law</em> (1996). Three volumes of essays were published in the 1980s &#8211; throughout his life, Hill wrote some of his most challenging and original work in articles and reviews. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHill was honoured by an OUP festschrift, <em>Puritans And Revolutionaries</em>, when he retired from Balliol in 1978, and Verso published a series of tributes and criticisms, <em>Reviving The English Revolution</em>, 10 years later. Yet, for the last 20 years of his life, he became once again a more controversial figure. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis methodology was famously assaulted by JH Hexter in a Times Literary Supplement review in 1975, and his assessment of Milton was powerfully denounced by Blair Worden. A reaction against his big reading of 17th-century history took root in the work of Conrad Russell, John Morrill and others. Yet Morrill's tribute in 1989 &#8211; &#8220;If we can be sure that the 17th century changed England and Englishmen more than any other century bar the present one, we owe that recognition to him more than to any other scholar&#8221; &#8211; shows how, even in relative eclipse, Hill remained the central point of reference in 17th-century studies. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPeople always felt there was something enigmatic about Hill. Whether as a friend walking through Oxfordshire or the Dordogne, as a tutor hunched in his armchair discussing an essay &#8211; and still more on formal occasions &#8211; he kept his cards close to his chest, forcing you to do the talking, making you listen to what you were saying in the way that he was listening too. But then he would make a joke, often just a pointed ironic observation, that made you love him. As someone once said, although he affected to be severe, he could not help being benign. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut tough too. Always. Hill once gave a radio talk marking the centenary of the publication of <em>Das Kapital</em>. He ended it by telling how, in old age, Marx had bumped into a fellow revolutionary from the 1848 barricades, now prosperous and complacent. The acquaintance reflected that, as one got older, one became less radical and less political. &#8220;Do you?&#8221; Marx replied. &#8220;Do you? Well, I do not!&#8221; And nor, he clearly intended us to understand, did Christopher Hill. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom <em>The Guardian</em> (UK), February 26, 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n"

He was then a small (5&#8217;4&#8221;), slightly built, frail adolescent with dark hair, dark oval-shaped eyes, and a gentle charming manner. He was immediately attracted to other young Jewish immigrants, mostly former students, now shop workers, who considered themselves intellectuals &#8211; a new radical <em>intelligentsia</em>.... For the most part their radicalism was rooted in their experiences in the European socialist and anarchist movements. But emigration and economic hardships in the United States also contributed to their further radicalization. As foreigners in America they were situated far enough outside the society to observe its failings. As frustrated but literate people, they were ambitious enough to participate in it. These young intellectuals were interested in finding alternatives to their present circumstances; their solution was to transform them.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>On his 18th birthday in August 1887, the future Hillquit joined the Socialist Labor Party of America, brought into the ranks by a fellow garment worker and Russian language socialist newspaper editor, Louis Miller. Moishe became a member of Section New York&#8217;s Branch 17, a Russian-speaking unit established by Jewish emigrés from tsarist Russia not long before his joining.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Within a year or so of joining the SLP, biographer Pratt notes, Moishe Hillkowitz became one of the party&#8217;s leading crusaders against anarchism, publishing a lengthy article &#8220;Sotzializm un anarchizm&#8221; in the <em>Arbeter zeitung</em> [Workers&#8217; News], a Yiddish newspaper that he helped to establish. Hillkowitz contrasted the individualism of anarchism with the communalism of socialism in this piece.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n9\">[9]</a></sup> During this time the 19 year old HIllkowitz worked as the business manager of the <em>Arbeter zeitung,</em> a paper which was jointly founded with Abraham Cahan, Louis Miller, and Morris Winchevsky in an effort to speak to the city&#8217;s Yiddish-speaking immigrant working class about socialism in their own idiom.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n10\">[10]</a></sup> Hillkowitz, ironically, was not fluent in Yiddish, having been raised with the German and Russian languages.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>He helped to found the United Hebrew Trades, a garment workers&#8217; union formed in 1888, while writing for the <em>Arbeiter Zeitung,</em> a Yiddish-language newspaper. He later graduated from New York University Law School in 1893.</p>\r\n<p>Hillquit led the departure of a dissident faction from Daniel De Leon&#8217;s Socialist Labor Party in 1899, a group which united with the Chicago-based Social Democratic Party of Victor Berger and Eugene V. Debs in 1901 to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). He remained a foremost political leader of that organization for the rest of his life, said to have espoused &#8220;the most popular brand of evolutionary Socialism within the Socialist Party.\"<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 1904, Hillquit attended the International Socialist Conference at Amsterdam and was involved in moving the proposed Anti-Immigration Resolution, which opposed any legislation which forbade or hindered the immigration of foreign working men, some of which were forced by misery to migrate. However, following &#8220;further consideration of the fact that workingmen of backward races (Chinese, Negroes, etc.) are often imported by capitalists to keep down the native workingmen by means of cheap labour, which constitutes a willing object of exploitation, lives in an ill-concealed state of slavery&#8221; as something which should be combatted by Social Democracy &#8220;with all its energy.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Hillquit ran for US Congress in the New York 9th Congressional District in 1908, winning 21.23% of the vote in a losing effort against a Democratic incumbent.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n13\">[13]</a></sup> After this campaign, Hillquit turned his attention to inner-party affairs. This brought him into conflict with the SPA&#8217;s syndicalist Left Wing. His biographer notes at least four serious points of departure between Hillquit and the Industrial Workers of the World wing of the party: (1) a disbelief in the stability and efficacy of industrial unions; (2) A distaste for the strike-oriented tactics of the IWW as opposed to collective bargaining; (3) A belief in the separation of functions between the political and labor wings of the workers&#8217; movement, as opposed to the IWW&#8217;s desire to make industrial organization primary; and (4) The radical tone of IWW propaganda, which Hillquit believed served to alienate much of society from the socialist movement and marginalize the left.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n14\">[14]</a></sup> His biographer declares that</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;His leadership fanned the fires of Party disagreement and although [Hillquit] was not alone in causing the break in 1913 with an important segment of its left wing, he certainly made a major contribution towards this unfortunate rupture.\"<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 1911, IWW leader William &#8220;Big Bill&#8221; Haywood was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City&#8217;s Cooper Union on Jan. 11, 1912. Haywood declared that Hillquit and the socialists ought to try &#8220;a little sabotage in the right place at the proper time&#8221; and attacked Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message rather than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. &#8220;A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists,&#8221; he declared.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Hillquit&#8217;s battle against the syndicalist left of the party continued at the 1912 National Convention, held in May in Indianapolis. Hillquit&#8217;s biographer notes that</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;As chairman of the Committee on Constitution he more than likely authored the amendment to the Party&#8217;s Article II, Section 6, which provided for the expulsion from the Party of &#8216;any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation....&#8217;&#8221; He voiced his justification for this anti-sabotage amendment by reassuring the convention that &#8216;if there is one thing in this country that can now check or disrupt the Socialist movement, it is not the capitalist class; it is not the Catholic Church; it is our own injudicious friends from within.&#8217;\"<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The issue of &#8220;syndicalism vs. socialism&#8221; was bitterly fought over the next two years, consumated by &#8220;Big Bill&#8221; Haywood&#8217;s recall from the SP&#8217;s NEC and the departure of a broad section of the left wing from the organization. The radical wing never forgave Hillquit for his anti-IWW orientation of these years and made him a major whipping boy in the big split that was to come.</p>\r\n<p>As a staunch internationalist and antimilitarist, Hillquit represented the ideological center of the Socialist Party during the years of World War I, which controlled the organization in coalition with the more pragmatist right wing exemplified by such locally-oriented leaders, politicians, and journalists as Victor Berger, Daniel Hoan, John Spargo, and Charles Edward Russell. He was elected to the SP&#8217;s governing National Executive Committee on multiple occasions and was a frequent speaker at national conventions of the party. Due to his foreign birth, however, Hillquit was not constitutionally eligible to serve as President or Vice President of the United States and was thus never a candidate of the party for national office.</p>\r\n<p>Hillquit was a principal co-author of the resolution against the United States&#8217; entry into World War One which was passed overwhelmingly both by an emergency Socialist Party convention held just after the April 6th, 1917, U.S. declaration of war and by a subsequent membership referendum.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n18\">[18]</a></sup> Despite official repression, popular patriotic pressure and vigilante action against the SP of A&#8217;s organization, members and press, Hillquit never wavered on the issue of intervention, staunchly backing Debs, Berger, Kate Richards O&#8217;Hare and other socialists charged under the Espionage Act for opposing the war effort.</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 1916, Hillquit was part of a three person delegation to President Wilson to advocate part of the Socialist Party&#8217;s peace program, which proposed that &#8220;the President of the United States convoke a congress of neutral nations, which shall offer mediation to the belligerents and remain in permanent session until the termination of the war.&#8221; A resolution to this effect had been offered in the House of Representatives by the SP&#8217;s lone Congressman, Meyer London of New York, and Wilson received Hillquit, London, and socialist trade unionist James H. Maurer at the White House, along with various other delegations. Hillquit later recalled that Wilson was at first &#8220;inclined to give us a short and perfunctory hearing&#8221; but as the Socialists made their case to him, the session &#8220;developed inot a serious and confidential conversation.&#8221; Wilson told the group that he had already considered a similar plan but chose not to put it into effect because he was not sure of its reception by other neutral nations. &#8220;The fact is,&#8221; Wilson claimed, &#8220;that the United States is the only important country that may be said to be neutral and disinterested. Practically all other neutral countries are in one way or another tied up with some belligerent power and dependent on it.\"<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n19\">[19]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Beginning in June 1917, Hillquit served as chief defense lawyer in a series of high profile cases on behalf of various socialist magazines and newspapers. The Wilson administration, headed in the matter by Postmaster General Albert Burleson, began to systematically ban specific issues or entire publications from the mail, or to force publications into financial peril by denying them access to low cost periodical rates. Hillquit argued cases on behalf of a number of important radical publications, including Max Eastman&#8217;s radical artistic and literary magazine, <em>The Masses;</em> the two socialist dailies &#8211; the <em>New York Call</em> and the <em>Milwaukee Leader;</em> the SP&#8217;s official weekly, <em>The American Socialist;</em> the popular monthly <em>Pearson&#8217;s Magazine;</em> and the Yiddish language <em>Jewish Daily Forward.</em> In each of these cases, Hillquit argued that the socialist press was truly &#8220;American&#8221; and that a socialist definition of &#8220;patriotism&#8221; included the freedoms of press and speech and the right to criticize in a democratic society.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n20\">[20]</a></sup> Hillquit was unsuccessful in winning access to the mails for the papers he represented, but he did manage to keep the proprietors of <em>The Masses</em> out of prison.</p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 1917, with nationalism and pro-war sentiment sweeping the nation, Hillquit ran for Mayor of New York City. Hillquit&#8217;s campaign was based on an anti-war platform and commitment to economical public services and drew the diverse support both of committed socialists, pacifists and other anti-war activists, and pro-war liberals endorsing his campaign as a protest against the government&#8217;s &#8220;sedition&#8221; policy, which effectively served to curb freedoms of speech and press.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n21\">[21]</a></sup> Hillquit seems to have been largely immune from attack by the Socialist Party&#8217;s left wing or other radicals during this high-profile campaign,<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n22\">[22]</a></sup> which ended with Hillquit collecting an impressive 22% of the citywide vote. This campaign, combined with the ongoing electoral success of Congressman Meyer London (elected as a Socialist in 1915, 1915, and 1921) marked the high point for Socialist Party politics in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>As a member of the SP&#8217;s National Executive Committee Hillquit worked closely with National Secretary Adolph Germer and James Oneal to defend the party from what in modern parlance might be described as an &#8220;unfriendly takeover&#8221; by its revolutionary socialist left wing. However, due to ill health Hillquit did not participate in the pivotal 1919 Emergency National Convention at Chicago which formalized the split of the left wing from the Socialist Party to form the Communist Labor Party and the Communist Party of America. Instead, Hillquit was ensconced in a sanitorium in upstate New York, recovering from another bout of tuberculosis, and was informed about the events of the convention after the fact.</p>\r\n<p>In 1920 Hillquit served as the lead attorney in the unsuccessful defense of the five democratically-elected Socialist assemblymen expelled from the New York State Assembly. Hillquit&#8217;s efforts to see Assemblymen Orr, Claessens, Waldman, DeWitt, and Solomon restored to office was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\r\n<p>From 1922 through the election of 1924, Hillquit was a leading advocate of Socialist Party participation in the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA).</p>\r\n<p>In 1932, shortly before his death from tuberculosis, Hillquit received over one-eighth of the vote in his second campaign for Mayor. This proved to be Hillquit&#8217;s final electoral run; during his life, he had been twice a candidate for Mayor of New York and on five times a nominee for Congress.</p>\r\n<p>One of the buildings of the East River Housing Corporation, a housing cooperative started by the International Ladies&#8217; Garment Workers&#8217; Union in Cooperative Village on the Lower East Side, was named in Hillquit&#8217;s honor.</p>\r\n<p>Hillquit&#8217;s papers are housed at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin at Madison and are available on microfilm.</p>\r\n<p>Hillquit was first and foremost an orator, delivering a torrent of public talks on socialist themes to various audiences throughout his life. In his memoirs, Hillquit conservatively estimates the total number of such speeches to have been &#8220;at least 2,000.&#8221; He often appeared in public debates taking up the socialist banner. He wrote frequently for popular magazines and the party press but fairly infrequently for publication in leaflet or pamphlet form. Despite the fact that Hillquit was not a prolific pamphleteer, he did author of a number of substantial books, including a serious academic history of socialism, <em>History of Socialism in the United States</em> (1903, revised 1910 &#8211; translated into both Russian and German); works of popularization, such as <em>Socialism in Theory and Practice</em> (1909) and <em>Socialism Summed Up</em> (1912); a short theoretical piece, <em>From Marx to Lenin</em> (1921); as well as a posthumously published memoir, <em>Loose Leaves from a Busy Life</em> (1934).</p>\r\n<h5>Footnotes</h5>\r\n<p class=\"information\"><a name=\"n1\"><span class=\"info\">1.</span></a> Norma Fain Pratt, <em>Morris Hillquit: A Political History of an American Jewish Socialist.</em> Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1979; page 3.

The rest are derived from that original\" (<a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hobbes.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Leviathan</span></a>). Memory and imagination are like the ripples which continue on after the initial distrubance has ended. While Hobbes points out that what is given in the senses is not equal to what is &quot;pressing upon&quot; the sense organs, he accepts that by means of sensation, we gain knowledge of the objects in the material world. [Interestingly, Hobbes accepts the Biblical story of God telling Adam the names of the animals, and speculates on how language develops from that beginning]. </p>\n<p>\nHe also advises that this knowledge will fall into error either due to inexperience, which can be corrected by further experience so long as the limitations of experience are attended to, or due to lack of adherence to formal logic in developing knowledge from the initial definitions of things. </p>\n<p>\nHobbes was 21 when Bacon's <span class=\"book\">Natural History for the Building Up of Philosophy</span> was published in 1609, and Hobbes was in touch with Bacon from 1619 till Bacon's death in 1626. Hobbes visited Galileo in Florence in 1636,and he received Descartes' <span class=\"book\">Discourse on Method</span> in 1637 and participated in the debate with Descartes published as <span class=\"book\">Objections</span>.</p>\n<p>\nLike both Bacon and Descartes, Hobbes had a low opinion of what passed as learning in his day, and his work advises people to call into question the received knowledge of the time, to turn away from recitation of the wisdom of Aristotle and build up Science upon a new and firm basis. </p>\n<p>\nHobbes was a <em>Royalist</em>, and most of his writing and publishing was done in France, away from the dangers of the English Civil War. He defended the social contract theory of Rousseau, but considered absolute monarchy the best form of state. His advocacy of the unrestricted character of state power was however appreciated by the birthing bourgeois class of the time. He published his <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/decive.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">De Cive</span></a> in Paris just as the Civil War began in England, and published <span class=\"book\">Leviathan </span>in 1651, two years after execution of Charles I. </p>\n<p>\nThe Christian religion for Hobbes was sometimes more of a useful means of pacifying and consoling the masses than an objective truth, and he came close to being denounced by the Parliament as atheist and heretic in 1666.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/politics/hobbes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Thomas Hobbes Archive</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nHobsbawm was an important figure in Marxist history writing and Marxist historiography during the twentieth century. His series of books on the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries remains one of the great achievements in twentieth century historical work and historical scholarship. Hobsbawm was similarly one of the most important Marxist and Communist intellectuals of the twentieth century, producing varied and powerful research on history, the study of history and political affairs. He became a communist and a socialist in the early 1930s, as a teenager, having joined the Sozialistischer Schülerbund (Association of Socialist Pupils), a section of the Young Communist League of Germany, in Berlin in 1931. He subsequently joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1936 and remained a member until shortly before the dissolution of the CPGB in 1991. Hobsbawm remained a member of the CPGB despite the 1956 and 1968 Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Hobsbawm is still highly regarded in the profession of history, both as a researcher, writer, and teacher. </p>\n<p>Politically, Hobsbawm was a loyal Communist for the majority of his adult life, having adopted socialism and communism in his teenage years, and retaining such politics until his death. He was loyal, yet critical, to the Soviet Union and the international Communist movement, especially after 1956 and the Hungarian Crisis. His politics were primarily shaped from his experiences during the Great Depression and in the struggle against Fascism during the 1930s. </p>\n<p>As a historian, Hobsbawm produced a powerful series of major books on European history and world history between the years 1789 and 1991 – the ‘Age’ series – including ‘Age of Revolution: 1789-1848’, ‘Age of Capital: 1848-1875’, ‘Age of Empire: 1875-1914’, and ‘Age of Extremes: 1914-1991’. These studies essentially covered the origins and development of the modern capitalist world after the French Revolution and Industrial Revolution, the long nineteenth century, up to the end of the twentieth century. Alongside these were studies in labour history, the history of the socialist, communist and anarchist movements, books on primitive labour movements, bandits, nationalism, the invention of traditions, the historiography of the French Revolution, the history and politics of South America, and a book on Jazz (written under the pseudonym of Francis Newton – named after the 1930s communist trumpet player Frankie Newton). He also produced a book of autobiography, Interesting Times, which detailed his life and the events of his times. The book of autobiography is particularly significant as a memoir of a communist intellectual in the mid to late twentieth century. </p>\n<p>Born in Egypt in June 1917 to a British father (Leopold Percy Hobsbaum) and an Austrian mother (Nelly Hobsbaum (née Grün)), Hobsbawm spent his childhood and early education in Vienna and Berlin. Following the death of his parents, the unemployment of the Great Depression, and the rise of Hitler and the Nazis in 1933, Hobsbawm emigrated with his aunt and uncle to the United Kingdom. He was educated in Vienna, Berlin, London and Cambridge. He graduated from Cambridge with a PhD in history (1947), on the Fabian Society, after military service in the Second World War. During the Second World War he served in the British Army, in the Royal Engineers and the Royal Army Educational Corps. From 1947 he taught history at Birkbeck College in London, retiring in 1982. Alongside this he also held teaching positions at the New School in New York and visiting Professorships at other Universities. He finished his academic career as President of Birkbeck, and as Emeritus Professor of economic and social history at Birkbeck, University of London. </p>\n<p>Hobsbawm was also a member of the CPGB Historians Group – the history section of the British Communist Party, which helped to revolutionise the researching and writing of British history in the post-war years after 1945. Hobsbawm was also a founder member and editor of the historical journal – ‘Past and Present’. His contributing essay to the first volume of that journal in 1952, ‘The Machine Breakers’, a concise study of Luddism, remains a classic essay of labour history and working-class history. Hobsbawm contributed further essays to the journal – including essays on seventeenth century economic history ('The General Crisis of the European Economy in the 17th Century’ parts I and II), ‘Political Shoemakers’, ‘The Social Function of the Past’, on ‘Peasant Land Occupations in Latin America’ and ‘A Life in History’. These were preceded and followed by extensive specialist essays on labour history and economic history, alongside significant contributions to social history, and historiography, during the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Amongst the Marxist historians of the CPGB history group, Hobsbawm was the most interested in global history and making connections across historical periods and areas of the globe. Alongside his comrades, C. Hill, E.P. Thompson, G. Rudé, R. Samuel, R. Hilton, V.G. Kiernan and others, Hobsbawm’s work changed the dynamics of how history was researched, written about and perceived. His historiographical impact was immense and continues to be immense – and not confined to simply historians of the Left. </p>\n<p>As a specialist in labour history, Hobsbawm contributed heavily to the development of labour history as a powerful genre of historical research, particularly via the methods of ‘history from below’. This produced key studies of nineteenth and twentieth century labour movements, particularly those in Great Britain. Hobsbawm was also a specialist in primitive forms of working-class resistance in the early years of industrial capitalism – particularly Luddism, banditry, militant sects, labour sects, peasant/worker leagues in Sicily, Mafia, millenarians, nineteenth century anarchists, and city mobs. This speciality produced two key historical works – 'Primitive Rebels' and 'Bandits'. Hobsbawm similarly worked in the 1980s and 1990s, on the subject of ‘invented traditions’, the historical justification of social traditions, and the historical origins and historical consequences of nationalism. </p>\n<p>Politically, Hobsbawm was a lifelong Communist, Socialist, Marxist and man of the Left, who wrote extensively on political and political historical matters, particularly the history and politics of the Left. After 1956, Hobsbawm refused to abandon the British Communist Party or his loyalty to the Soviet Union, but he developed friendly relations with the British New Left, and became a key intellectual influence on British Left politics after 1968. After 1956 he produced many key political essays which complemented his historical work. Many of these appeared in the key Left journals of the late twentieth century – from New Left Review to Marxism Today. Many of his political essays tended to focus on the contemporary problems of the British Left and International Left, alongside frequent discussions on Italian, French and South American Left politics. His 1978 essay ‘The Forward March of Labour Halted?’, while controversial, highlighted the difficulties that the British Left and International Left would face in the 1980s and during the era of neo-liberalism. Hobsbawm’s relationship with the USSR can be summarised as ‘loyal yet critical’ – Hobsbawm remained loyal to the Soviet Union, but he frequently criticised its shortcomings and its betrayals after 1956. He particularly was critical of the crimes of Stalin and the Hungarian invasion of 1956. Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of the British Communist Party, Hobsbawm remained a man of the Left for the remainder of his life. He famously refused to renounce Marxism and the possibility of Socialism – while acknowledging the difficulties of Socialist politics after 1991. He still held out for the possibility of a socialist future for humanity. </p>\n<p>Personally. Hobsbawm married twice. His first marriage, to Muriel Seaman, lasted from 1943 to 1951, ending in divorce. His second marriage, to Marlene Schwarz, in 1962, ended with his death in 2012. He had two children, Julia Hobsbawm and Andy Hobsbawm, from his second marriage. A third child, Joshua Bennathan, was born from an out of wedlock relationship with educational psychologist Marion Bennathan in 1958. As mentioned Hobsbawm wrote extensively on Jazz – producing both a book on the politics and history of Jazz, as well as Jazz reviews for the New Statesman. </p>\n<p>Eric Hobsbawm died in London in October 2012, at the age of 95. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery, close to the grave of Marx. </p>\n<p>  Selected Publications: ‘Labour’s Turning Point’ (1948), ‘Primitive Rebels’ (1959), ‘The Jazz Scene’ (1959), ‘The Age of Revolution’ (1962), ‘Labouring Men’ (1964), ‘Industry and Empire’ (1968), ‘Bandits’ (1969), ‘Capitan Swing’ (1969), ‘Revolutionaries’ (1973), ‘The Age of Capital’ (1975), ‘The Invention of Tradition’ (1983), ‘Worlds of Labour’, (1984), ‘Age of Empire’ (1989), ‘Echoes of the Marseillaise’ (1990), ‘Nations and Nationalism Since 1780’ (1991), 'The Age of Extremes' (1994), ‘On History’ (1997), ‘Uncommon People’ (1998), ‘The New Century’ (2000), ‘Interesting Times’ (2002), ‘How to Change the World’ (2011), ‘Fractured Times’ (2013), ‘Viva la Revolucion’ (2016). </p>\n\n\n"

Following the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, Ho returned to Vietnam in 1941, where he set up a base in the hills near the Chinese border, where many workers and youth fled from Hanoi. Founded the Viet Minh to fight the Japanese, and sought assistance from the US. Truman promised independence for Vietnam in exchange for support against the Japanese. The Viet Minh assisted in suppressing the uprising of the Saigon workers in 1945. French colonialism reclaimed the country, and Ho took the leadership of the war for independence which ended in victory at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Accepting the peace negotiated at Geneva, Ho withdrew his troops to the North, and allowed the US to occupy the South. Then began the 20 years war against the US.

Holbach&#8217;s estate was a meeting place for the leading French radical thinkers of the late 18th century. He was an atheist, a determinist, and a materialist: the universe is a complex system of physical substances organized according to mechanistic laws of cause and effect, rather than designed by God (the view of most of his contemporaries, though not the common view among the philosophes). </p>\n<p>Holbach was an opponent of absolute monarchy, state religions and feudal privilege. It is fair to describe him as one of the most radical intellectuals of his time. He authored many works whose radical ideas had to be published in Holland without his name on the title page. His most famous work is <i>The System of Nature</i> (1770). A briefer account of his atheistic materialism was published in 1772: <i>Common Sense, or Natural Ideas vs. Supernatural Ideas</i>. </p>\n<p>Holbach tried to prove by his life that one could be virtuous and an atheist, contrary to a common view of the time. Rousseau, who disliked Holbach, used him as the model of the &#8216;virtuous unbeliever&#8217; in <i>The New Heloise</i>. Holbach held that atheism is a prerequisite for any valid ethical theory. Religion, he thought, is based on useless and meaningless dogmas and rituals; whereas ethics must be based on social utility and human cooperation. </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/holbach/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Holbach Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n"

April 11, 1985, Tiranë, Albania)</p>\n<p>Albania's first Communist head of government, a capacity in which he served for four decades.  He is perhaps best remebered for his polemics with the post-Stalin leadership of the USSR and with Maoist China.       \n</p>\n<p>Hoxha was a school teacher at the French lyc&eacute;e in Korcë until the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939, whereupon he was dismissed for refusing to join the newly-formed Albanian Fascist Party.  Hoxha then opened a tobacco shop in Tiranë, which, in time, became the center for a communist cell.   After the German invasion of Albania in 1941, Hoxha and other militants formed the Albanian Communist Party, which was later renamed the Party of Labor of Albania (PLA).  Hoxha was named secretary of the party's Central Committee and political commissar for the Army of National Liberation, which fought against the German army and fascist and feudal Albanian forces.   From 1944 until 1954 he was Albania's prime minister, and later held other posts in the government, but as secretary of the PLA's Central Committee, effectivel controlled the government until his death.\n</p>\n<p>Following liberation from the Italian and German occupations, Albania's society and economy were revolutionized.  The feudal relations which had remained from Ottoman rule were swept away and agriculture was collectivized, enabling Albania to eventually attain near-self sufficiency in food.  Simultaneously, industry, which had previously been almost nonexistent, grew to contribute more than 50% of the gross national product by the 1980s.   Electricity was brought to every rural district, epidemicdiseases were controlled, and illiteracy was made a thing of the past.\n</p>\n<p>These gains, however, were accompanied by brutal Stalinist tactics. The PLA government imprisoned, executed, or exiled thousands of landowners, rural clan leaders, Muslim and Christian clerics, peasants who resisted collectivization, and party officials.   Hoxha's social and economic policies, whicheven prohibited private ownership of automobiles, exercised a brake on Albania's development and meant that in some areas collective agriculture was not even mechanized.   Despite gains in food production and industrialization, by the 1980s Albania was widely regarded as having the lowest standard of living Europe, but Hoxha's isolationist policies left a populace so out of touch with the outside world that many thought that Albania was the most prosperous country in Europe.\n</p>\n<p> In 1948 Hoxha broke relations with Yugoslavia and drew closer to the Soviet Union, and to Joseph Stalin, for whom he held a life-long admiration.   Indeed, after Stalin's death and Nikita Krushchev's \"secret speech\" denouncing him, Hoxha and the PLA broke with the Soviet Union and formed a bloc with the Communist Party of China in denouncing the post-Stalin USSR as \"revisionist\" and \"social-imperialist\" . (See, for example, his speech at the Meeting of 81 Communist Parties in Moscow in 1960, <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hoxha/works/nov1960.htm\" target=\"_top\">\"Reject the Revisionist Theses of the XX Congress of the CPSU and the Anti-Marxist Stand of Krushchev's Group! Uphold Marxism-Leninism!\"</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>However, Hoxha's relations with the Maoists were not entirely smooth.  For one thing they had differing notions of \"protracted people's war.\"   Mao and his followers world-wide insisted that in peasant countries urban insurrection must occur in the last stages of the revolutionary war, which until then would have the countryside as its theater of operations.  Hoxha insisted, on the other hand, that the cities ought not to be left until last but that actions must be carried out simultaneously in city and countryside.    As revolutionary movements gathered momentum in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, continents with large rural populations, these issues were at the center of intense debates between \"Hoxhaists\" and Maoists.  \n</p>\n<p>Relations grew further strained as the cult of personality around Mao grew, China drew closer to the United States and other capitalist countries, and as China's stature and influence increased internationally.   Eventually, Hoxha broke with that country in 1978 after the death of Mao Zedong and China's rapprochement with the West.  In that year he published <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm\" target=\"_top\"><em>Imperialism and the Revolution</em></a>, in which he declared that Mao Zedong was not a Marxist-Leninist and that there were no Marxist-Leninists in China.  From then on, Hoxha's Albania turned in on itself as Hoxha, having alienated every ally and workers' government, declared that Albania not only would become a model socialist republic on its own, but that it was the only socialist country left in the world.\n</p>\n<p>Hoxha retired from active politics in 1981, but not without carrying out a final purge in which the several leading party members and government officials were executed.   The reins of government were handed to Hoxha's proteg&eacute;, Ramiz Alia, who suceeded him upon his death in 1985.\n</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>See:</em> <strong><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hoxha/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Hoxha Reference Archive</a></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../h.htm\">Index of the Letter H</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

Hume died in the year of the American War of Independence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHume denied theological doctrines and acknowledged the evils that religion had wrought upon humanity. How was one to develop then a &quot;secular&quot; system of philosophy and morality? What answer could be given to Berkeley's &quot;proof&quot; that the concept of a material world beyond sensation was a &quot;metaphysical absurdity&quot;? How could we get on with science and industry, trade and conquest, without religion?</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHume accepted Berkeley's proof, but developed the philosophy of <em>Scepticism</em>, a British compromise, in which, while the knowledge we gain from experience cannot constitute theoretcial knowledge or necessity, it is good enough for practical purposes, sufficient for practical life. The Sun has risen every morning so far, so its reasonable to work on the assumption that it will probably rise again tomorrow. In place of ethics, Hume embraced the Utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, in which an act is good if it produces the &quot;greatest happiness for the greatest number of individuals&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHume was a contemporary of Immanuel Kant, with whom his philosophy may well be compared. Kant is dealing with the same crisis of knowledge, but in the distinctly German, rather than British, way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hume.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": " \r\nGerman philosopher, the founder of Phenomenology, a method for the description and analysis of consciousness, and aiming to resolve the opposition between Empiricism and Rationalism by indicating the origin of all philosophical and scientific systems in the interests and structures of experience.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHusserl was born into a Jewish family and completed his qualifying examinations in 1876 in the neighbouring city of Olm&uuml;tz. He then studied physics, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy at the universities of Leipzig, Berlin, and Vienna. In Vienna he received his PhD in 1882 with a dissertation entitled <span class=\"book\">Contributions to the Theory of the Calculus of Variations</span>. In the autumn of 1883, Husserl moved to Vienna to study with <a href=\"../../people/b/r.htm#brentano-franz\">Franz Brentano</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHusserl received a decisive impetus from Brentano and his circle of students where the spirit of the Enlightenment, with its religious tolerance and its quest for a rational philosophy, was very much alive. Husserl's striving for a more strictly rational foundation found its corroboration here. Such a foundation meant for him not only a theoretical act but the moral meaning of responsibility in the sense of ethical autonomy. In Vienna Husserl converted to the Evangelical Lutheran faith, and one year later, in 1887, he married Malvine Steinschneider, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher from Prossnitz, who was to be his indispensable support in life. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1886 Husserl went to Carl Stumpf, the oldest of Brentano's students, who was professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Halle. In 1887 Husserl qualified as a lecturer in the university. He had become a close friend of Stumpf, and was indebted to Stumpf for many suggestions in the formation of his own descriptive concepts. The theme of Husserl's thesis, <span class=\"book\">On the Concept of Number: Psychological Analyses</span>, already showed Husserl in the transition from his mathematical research to a reflection on a psychological source for the basic concepts of mathematics. These investigations were an earlier draft of his <span class=\"book\">Philosophy of Arithmetic</span> which appeared in 1891. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe title of his inaugural lecture in Halle was <span class=\"book\">On the Goals and Problems of Metaphysics</span>. In the traditional sense metaphysics is the study of Being. Though the text is lost, it is clear that Husserl already understood his method of the analysis of consciousness to be the way to a new universal philosophy and metaphysics, which he hoped would displace all previous schemes. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe years of his teaching in Halle (1887-1901) were later seen by Husserl to have been his most difficult. He often doubted his ability as a philosopher and believed he would have to give up his occupation. The problem of uniting a psychological analysis of consciousness with a philosophical grounding of formal mathematics and logic seemed insoluble. But from this crisis there emerged the conviction that the philosophical grounding of logic and mathematics must commence with an analysis of the experience that lies before all formal thinking. Husserl made an intensive study of the <a href=\"../../terms/e/m.htm#empiricism\">British Empiricists</a>, such as Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and <a href=\"../../people/m/i.htm#mill-john-stuart\">J S Mill</a>, and the logic and semantics stemming from this tradition, especially the logic of Mill, and studied the attempts at a &quot;psycho-logic&quot; grounding of logic then being made in Germany. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe fruits of this work were presented in the <span class=\"book\">Logical Investigations</span> (1900-01), which employed a method of analysis that Husserl now designated as &quot;phenomenological.&quot; After the publication of the <span class=\"book\">Logical Investigations</span>, Husserl was called, at the instigation of <a href=\"../h/i.htm#hilbert-david\">David Hilbert</a> to the University of G&ouml;ttingen. Husserl's time of teaching in G&ouml;ttingen, from 1901 to 1916, was important as the source of the Phenomenological movement. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe phenomenological analysis of experienced reality - i.e., of reality as it immediately presents itself to consciousness - drew not only the German students who were unsatisfied with the Neo-Kantianism that then prevailed in Germany but also many young foreign philosophers who came from the traditions of Empiricism and <a href=\"../../terms/p/r.htm#pragmatism\">Pragmatism</a>. From about 1905, Husserl's students formed themselves into a group with a common style of life and work. Standing in close personal contact with their teacher, they always spoke of him as the &quot;master&quot;. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHusserl himself had developed an individual style of working: all of his thoughts were conceived in writing, and during his life he produced more than 40,000 pages. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHusserl was still at G&ouml;ttingen when Max Scheler, who was at that time a lecturer in Jena and who later became an important Phenomenologist, came in contact with Husserl (1910-11). Husserl's friendship with <a href=\"../../people/d/i.htm#dilthey-wilhelm\">Wilhelm Dilthey</a>, also falls within this period. Husserl later acknowledged that his encounter with Dilthey had turned his attention to the historical life out of which all of the sciences originated and that, in so doing, it had opened for him the dimension of history as the foundation of every theory of knowledge. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the G&ouml;ttingen years, Husserl drafted the outline of Phenomenology as a universal philosophical science. Its fundamental methodological principle was what Husserl called the phenomenological reduction. It focuses the philosopher's attention on uninterpreted basic experience and the quest, thereby, for the essences of things. In this sense, it is &quot;eidetic&quot; reduction. On the other hand, it is also the reflection on the functions by which essences become conscious. As such, the reduction reveals the ego for which everything has meaning. Hence, Phenomenology took on the character of a new style of transcendental philosophy, which repeats and improves Kant's mediation between Empiricism and Rationalism in a new way. Husserl presented its program and its systematic outline in the <span class=\"book\">Ideas; General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology</span> (1913). With this work, Husserl wanted to give his students a manual. The result, however, was just the opposite: most of his students took Husserl's turn to transcendental philosophy as a lapse back into the old system of thought and rejected it. With the onset of the war, the phenomenological school fell apart. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1916 he was appointed Professor at the University of Freiburg. His inaugural lecture on <span class=\"book\">Pure Phenomenology, Its Area of Research and Its Method</span> circumscribed a new program of work. He had understood the War as the collapse of the old European world, in which spiritual culture, science, and philosophy had held an incontestable position. After this, his reflections were directed with special emphasis upon philosophy's task in the renewal of life. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe continued his attempt to clarify the relation between psychological and phenomenological analysis of consciousness and considered the grounding of logic in the <span class=\"book\">Formal and Transcendental Logic</span> (1929). </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this last period of his life, Husserl's teaching assumed a different style from that at G&ouml;ttingen. It did not lead to the founding of a new school and assumed more the character of a monologue. Nevertheless, numerous foreign guests usually took part in his seminar, and <a href=\"../../people/c/a.htm#carnap-rudolph\">Rudolf Carnap</a>, a leading figure in the <a href=\"../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle\">Vienna Circle</a>, also studied under Husserl. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLectures at the University of Amsterdam and later at the Sorbonne furnished the occasion for a new systematic presentation of Phenomenology, <span class=\"book\">M&eacute;ditations cart&eacute;siennes</span>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he retired in 1928, <a href=\"../../people/h/e.htm#heidegger-martin\">Martin Heidegger</a>, who was to become a leading <a href=\"../../terms/e/x.htm#existentialism\">Existentialist</a>, became his successor. Husserl had looked upon him as his legitimate heir. Only later did he see that Heidegger's chief work, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/heidegg2.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Being and Time</span></a> (1927), had given Phenomenology a turn that would lead down an entirely different path, and their relationship cooled after 1930. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn Hitler's seizure of power in 1933, Husserl was excluded from the university; but he received numerous visits by foreign philosophers and scholars. Condemned to silence in Germany, he received, in the spring of 1935, an invitation to address the Cultural Society in Vienna. There he spoke freely for two and one-half hours on <span class=\"book\">Philosophy in the Crisis of European Mankind</span> and repeated the lecture two days later. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHusserl also addressed the University in Prague in the fall of 1935, after which many discussions took place in the smaller circles. Out of these lectures came Husserl's last work, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/husserl.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the summer of 1937, the illness that made it impossible for him to continue his work set in and he died in April 1938 near Freiburg.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../h.htm\">Index of the Letter H</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

After South Korea declared independence, Kim was appointed as Prime Minister of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and became vice-chairman of the Workers Party of North Korea.

He rose rapidly in the socialist movement, being made Joint Assistant Secretary in 1907, a post he maintained until 1913. Inkpin took a leading role in the campaign against the &#8220;national&#8221; socialists, pro-imperialist forces, who controlled the journal <em>Justice</em>, which had been the official organ of the SDF. </p>\n<p>\nWith the reorganisation of the bulk of the SDF into the Social Democratic Party and then the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/r.htm#british-socialist-party\">British Socialist Party</a>, founded in 1911 in Manchester, as a result of the merger of the Social Democratic Party with other socialist groups, he began to take an even more central role. Inkpin succeeded H. W. Lee as the General Secretary of the BSP in 1913. </p>\n<p>\nDuring the First World War a sharp struggle developed in the party between the internationalist trend and the social-chauvinist trend headed by the long-term leader of the SDF, <a href=\"../h/y.htm#hyndman-henry\">H. M. Hyndman</a>. In February 1916 a group of the party&#8217;s active members founded the newspaper <em>The Call</em>, which played an important part in uniting the internationalists. Inkpin was editor of <em>The Call</em>, which became the BSP&#8217;s official organ, from 1916 to 1919. The annual conference of the BSP held at Salford in April 1916 condemned the social-chauvinists and they subsequently left the party. </p>\n<p>\nInkpin remained in the role of BSP national secretary until it joined with others to form the Communist Party in 1920. He was a key figure in the anti-war movement from 1914 and represented the BSP at the Zimmerwald Conference of peace forces in the international socialist movement and also took a leading role in agitation in support of the Russian Revolution. </p>\n<p>\nHe was active in the organising of the Leeds Conference 1918-9, attended by <a href=\"../m/a.htm#macdonald-ramsay\">J.

In 1919, Inkpin represented the BSP as an observer in Berlin during the famous Kapp Putch. </p>\n<p>\nHe was the key figure for the BSP at all the socialist unity conferences and committees during the 1919-21 period. Indeed, the main report at the founding congress&#8212;over the weekend of July 31 and August 1 1920&#8212;was given by Inkpin as Secretary of the Joint Provisional Committee of the Communist Party. In 1920, he was prosecuted by the British authorities for having printed and circulated Communist Party literature and was sentenced to six months in prison.

At the St. Pancras Congress held in March 1922, a Comintern report was endorsed and a Commission was established to carry through the reorganisation of the party from top to bottom. Harry Pollitt, R.

He then became its National Organiser during 1922-3 and was back again in 1923 as General Secretary. </p>\n<p>\nInkpin was one of twelve Communist leaders taken into custody between 15-17 October 1925, in anticipation of the impending General Strike, and charged with violation of the Mutiny Act of 1797. On 26 November a jury found all of them guilty and various sentences were imposed. Inkpin got six months and all of them were out of action in the vital period of preparing for the great strike. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1929, the much younger Harry Pollitt replaced Inkpin as General Secretary. In all Inkpin had led the Party for nine years, after 13 years as a senior official of Britain&#8217;s socialists.

        "content": "\nThe British working-class intellectual, Thomas Alfred Jackson, was born in London in 1879. Tommy Jackson&#8212;always T. A. to the world&#8212;he is remembered as the working-class autodidact. As a young man, he read classics works mainly since contemporary literature was too expensive. (A survey found that while 55 percent of working-class adults read books, they rarely bought new books.) He built up an impressive library by haunting used-book stalls and generally scavenging. His obsession with books led him to rather neglect his attire and appearance! </p>\n<p>\nDevoted as a young boy to Walter Scott&#8217;s Waverley novels, Jackson later realised that Scott &#8220;was a shocking old Tory, and a reactionary,&#8221; but he insisted that one could read Ivanhoe as a critique of capitalism, with &#8220;The gallantry and efficiency of Robin Hood, and his outlaws, the sturdy courage of the Saxons ... &#8221;</p>\n<p>\nHe was moved to radicalism by boyhood admiration for the Irish home-ruler, Parnell and developed into Second International Marxism out of opposition to the British aggression against the Boers. Jackson, early in life, declared himself Marxist Socialist. Reading secular material as a youth, he was profoundly influenced by the writings of <a href=\"../../people/d/a.htm#darwin\">Charles Darwin</a>, Robert Blatchford and T. H. Huxley, leading to his gradual abandonment of mainstream politics and Christianity.</p>\n<p>\nHe joined a study group connected with the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#sdf\">Social Democratic Federation</a>, studying history, economics, science, and political theory. In his autobiography, Jackson jumped wholeheartedly into debates concerning evolutionary socialism and scientific socialism, lecturing and writing on natural science and economics as part of a Marxist explanation for human existence. Certainly by 1900, Jackson was a member of the SDF. </p>\n<p>\nHe was one of the founders in 1904 of the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-great-britain\">Socialist Party of Great Britain</a>, a still extant but always tiny sect of Marxists believing in a long educational route to socialism. He is named in the Minutes of Inaugural Meeting held at Printers&#8217; Hall, Bartletts Passage, Fetter Lane, London, E.C. at 6pm on Sunday 12th June 1904 and was at the First Annual Conference, 20 April 1905, Communist Club, 107 Charlotte St, London. He held some capacity not exactly as the secretary of the SPGB but certainly in an acting capacity in this period.</p>\n<p>\nT. A. Jackson was in despair at &#8220;an almost total failure to agree as to what &#8216;Socialism&#8217; meant in terms of concrete, specific, political practice&#8221;. [John Callaghan, <em>Socialism in Britain</em>, Basil Blackwell (1990), pp. 27-29] Later, he was one of the founders of the British Communist Party and became a leading member and theoretician of the Communist Party for the rest of his life. </p>\n<p>\nAn important part of the Salford based Working Class Movement Library is the T. A. Jackson Irish Collection, which contains some seven hundred volumes on Irish history, among them notable early works such as <em>Wakefield&#8217;s Survey of Ireland</em>. Jackson&#8217;s own rather famous book, <em>Ireland&#8212;Her Own</em>, was published in 1946. It has since been credited with winning many Irish republicans to left ideas. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough he had no Irish ancestors, he was from well before the Easter uprising a tireless promoter of Irish freedom. After meeting <a href=\"../c/o.htm#connolly-james\">James Connolly</a> on a tour of England, Jackson was won to the cause. Afterwards he was closely associated with Connolly&#8217;s closest lieutenant, Con Lehane, who suggested that he write a Marxist history of Ireland. That book became <em>Ireland&#8212;Her Own,</em> which is dedicated to Lehane.</p>\n<p>\nJackson&#8217;s daughter married A. L. Morton, the celebrated Communist Party historian. T. A. Jackson died in 1955 and the Communist Party honoured the centenary of Jackson&#8217;s birth in 1979.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/\">Graham Stevenson</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/jackson-ta/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">T.

Whereas Saussure had insisted that the study of the structural relations within and between languages as they exist at any given time (synchonistic study) and the study of the changes in sounds and their relations over time (diachronic study) were completely separate and mutually exclusive, the Prague School said:</p>\n\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;It is the structural analysis of language in the process of development &#8211; the analysis of children's language and its general laws &#8211; and of language in the process of disintegration &#8211; aphasic language &#8211; which enables us to throw light on the selection of phonemes, the distinctive features, and their mutual relations, and to get closer to the main principles of this selection and of this interdependence so as to be in a position to establish and explain the universal laws which underlie the phonological structure of the world's languages&#8221;.[<a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm\" target=\"_top\">Lectures on Sound and Meaning</a>, 1942]</p>\n<p>\nJakobson also held that Saussure's key insight that sounds had an essentially arbitrary relation to meaning, meaning being determined by their stuctural relations with other sounds which differed in this or that way, was an overstatement.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1933, Jakobson became Professor of Russian Philology Masarykova University in Brno, Czechoslovakia, but the impending Nazi invasion forced him to flee Sweden, where he found work as visiting professor.

Committed suicide after being imprisoned for &#8220;leftism&#8221; in 1927. His wife Maria, also a leading Bolshevik, survived in labour camps until after Stalin's death, and published her autobiography in the 1980s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAdolph Joffe was born in Simferopol, Russia, on 10th October, 1883. The son of a wealthy merchant, he became involved in revolutionary activity while a student in the late 1890s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJoffe joined the Social Democratic Party in 1903 and the following year became involved in smuggling political propaganda to Baku. He moved to Moscow during the 1905 Russian Revolution. The following year he was forced into exile. He lived in Berlin before being expelled from Germany in May, 1906. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJoffe now moved to Vienna where he edited Pravda with Leon Trotsky. He often visited Russia and in 1912 he was arrested and after spending ten months in solitary confinement before being exiled to Siberia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1917 Joffe escaped from Siberia and made his way to Petrograd. He was elected to the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolshevik Central Committee. During the October Revolution Joffe was the chairman of the Military Revolutionary Committee. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn December, 1917, Joffe went with Leon Trotsky as a member of the Russian delegation at Brest-Litovsk that was negotiating with representatives from Germany and Austria. They had the difficult task of trying to end Russian participation in the First World War without having to grant territory to the Central Powers. By employing delaying tactics Joffe and Trotsky hoped that socialist revolutions would spread from Russia to Germany and Austria-Hungary before they had to sign the treaty. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter nine weeks of discussions without agreement, the German Army was ordered to resume its advance into Russia. On 3rd March 1918, with German troops moving towards Petrograd, Vladimir Lenin ordered Joffe and Trotsky to accept the terms of the Central Powers. The Brest-Litovsk Treaty resulted in the Russians surrendering the Ukraine, Finland, the Baltic provinces, the Caucasus and Poland.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Leon Trotsky took control of the Red Army during the Civil War, Joffe replaced him as Commissar for Foreign Affairs and carried out negotiations with Turkey and Germany. While in Berlin he was accused of planning a communist revolution and was expelled from the country.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJoffe was a loyal supporter of Leon Trotsky and after Joseph Stalin gained power was sent him abroad as a diplomatic. In 1927 Joffe was one of the few leading Bolsheviks who was willing to defend Trotsky. After the expulsion of Trotsky from the Central Committee, Joffe decided to commit suicide. Adolph Joffe died on 16th November, 1927. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJoffe wrote in the <em>Granat Encyclopaedia of the Russian Revolution</em>:</p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nIn 1904 I was instructed by the Central Committee to convey literature to Baku and to conduct propaganda there. I joined the Baku SD organization, but I had to leave Transcaucasia in the same year to avoid arrest, and I was sent to Moscow for the same sort of work. I was soon exposed there, too, so I took refuge abroad, where I arrived immediately after the events of 9 January 1905. I straightaway returned to Russia and took part in the Revolution in various towns. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nTrotsky wrote about Adolph Joffe in <em>My Life</em>:</p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nJoffe was a man of great intellectual ardour, very genial in all his personal relations, and unswervingly loyal to the cause. In connection with the activities of the Pravda Joffe went to Russia for revolutionary work. He was arrested in Odessa, spent a long time in prison, and was later exiled to Siberia. He was not set free until February 1917, as a result of the revolution of that month. In the October revolution which followed he played one of the most active parts. </p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nJoffe tried to make his death a service to the same cause to which he had dedicated his life. With the same hand that was to pull the trigger against his own temple half an hour later, he wrote the last evidence of a witness and the last counsel of a friend. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAdolph Joffe&#8217;s suicide letter sent to Leon Trotsky on 16th November, 1927: </p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nI have never doubted the rightness of the road you pointed out, and as you know, I have gone with you for more than twenty years, since the days of 'permanent revolution'. But I have always believed that you lacked Lenin unbending will, his unwillingness to yield, his readiness even to remain alone on the path that he thought right in the anticipation of a future majority, of a future recognition by everyone of the rightness of his path. </p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nPolitically, you were always right, beginning with 1905, and I told you repeatedly that with my own ears I had heard Lenin admit that even in 1905, you, and not he, were right. One does not lie before his death, and now I repeat this again to you. But you have often abandoned your rightness for the sake of an overvalued agreement or compromise. This is a mistake. I repeat: politically you have always been right, and now more right than ever. Some day the party will realize it, and history will not fail to accord recognition. Then don't lose your courage if someone leaves you know, or if not as many come to you, and not as soon, as we all would like.</p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nYou are right, but the guarantee of the victory of your rightness lies in nothing but the extreme unwillingness to yield, the strictest straightforwardness, the absolute rejection of all compromise; in this very thing lay the secret of Lenin's victories. Many a time I have wanted to tell you this, but only now have I brought myself to do so, as a last farewell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://spartacus-educational.com/\">Spartacus Schoolnet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\nSwiss psychologist and psychiatrist who founded Analytic Psychology, the first great rival to <a href=\"../f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Sigmund Freud</a>'s psychoanalysis. Jung proposed and developed the concepts of the extroverted and introverted personality and archetypes which have been influential in psychiatry and are the basis of the Myer-Briggs Personality types. Drawing on concepts from astrology and mythology, Jung introduced the idea of the Collective Unconscious, wherein figures repeatedly appearing in dreams, myths etc., are supposed to have a substantial, non-material reality, and Jung openly declared himself a philosophical idealist.</p>\n<p>\nThe son of a pastor, Jung had a lonely childhood and from an early age was observing his father's failing belief in religion and the difficulties of the other adults around him. As a teenager he was already reading widely in philosophy, and attended the Universities of Basel and Zurich and graduated as a psychiatrist in 1900. </p>\n<p>\nJung then went to work at the Burgh&ouml;lzli Psychiatric Clinic in Z&uuml;rich and became its Director in 1903. At Burgh&ouml;lzli, Jung applied the method of free association, which had been applied earlier by <a href=\"../f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Freud</a>, and identified groups of words that stimulated strong responses, which Jung took to be related to the patient's suppression of some common underlying disturbance, and which he took to have a sexual content. Jung coined the term <em>complex</em> to refer to these clusters of associations and the psychological condition behind them. </p>\n<p>\nThese researches gave Jung an international reputation, and from 1907 Jung collaborated closely with Freud, leaving the Institute to set up his own practice in Zurich in 1909, while continuing to lecture at the University of Zurich. Jung's findings confirmed many of Freud's ideas, and he was widely thought of as the most likely successor to Freud. However, like very many others in the years to follow, Jung did not share Freud's obsessive and exclusive focus on sexuality as the root of psychosis and this soon lead to an acrimonious split. Jung's <span class=\"book\">Psychology of the Unconscious</span> established his international standing, and Jung resigned from Freud's International Psychoanalytic Society in 1914. </p>\n<p>\nOne of the difficulties in appreciating Jung's achievement is that he focussed his work very much on the study of patients with extreme personality disorders; however, the mental structures that Jung was describing are equally characteristic of normal mentality. The most widely known of these structures was his identification of the <em>Extroverted</em> (outward-looking) and <em>Introverted</em> (inward-looking) personality types. Later he described four functions of the mind &#8211; Thinking and Feeling, the different ways in which people evaluate situations (&#8220;decision instruments&#8221;), and Sensing and Intuition, the different ways in which people organise their conception of the world. In any given person, one or the other of these functions will predominate over the other. Jung presented these ideas in his 1921 <span class=\"book\">Psychological Types</span>, the first modern theory of personality.</p>\n<p>\nThe other aspect of Jung's work which has been very influential is his approach to the analysis of dreams. After his break with Freud, Jung made an extensive study of his own dreams, taking extensive notes as soon as he awoke. Jung identified numbers of particularly vivid images, which he began to see were to be found not only in his dreams, but appeared in Mythology, and Religion across the ages, as well as being commonly reported by other people in their dreams. He coined the term <em>Archetypes</em> for these images &#8211; instinctive, universal images and associated behaviour patterns, and ascribed their appearance in the individual's mind to a <em>Collective Unconscious</em>, shared by everyone.</p>\n<p>\nThis linking of individual psychological experiences with belief patterns found throughout history led Jung to a study of the history of religion and social beliefs which was to be his main focus for the remainder of his life.</p>\n<p>\nIn later years he became Professor of Psychology at the Federal Polytechnical University in Z&uuml;rich (1933-41) and Professor of Medical Psychology at the University of Basel (1943). Jung's belief that Germany held a special position in Europe, a view he was not shy to express in public, led to his being wrongly branded as a Nazi sympathiser.

In philosophy he was the founder of  the \"Critical Philosophy\"; immediate precursor of Hegel. Kant confronted the problem posed by <a href=\"../../people/h/u.htm#hume-david\">Hume</a> showing that if knowledge could only be derived from experience, then in fact there could be no knowledge of a world \"beyond sensation\" - and yet positive knowledge clearly did exist. In studying the forms of cognition and its limits, Kant developed a philosophy riddled with contradictions which provided the material upon which Hegel was able to build. Kant held that \"things-in-themselves\" (beyond sensation) were in principle unknowable - only \"phenomena\" are knowable. Showing that opposite propositions about the nature of reality can be proved, Kant held that these contradictions are only \"seeming\" and knowledge of \"things-in-themselves\" is accessible only by Faith. The influence of Kant is still far more extensive than that of Hegel among today's philosophers and social theorists.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe philosophical world into which Immanuel Kant entered was one riven by apparently irresolvable contradictions. The period from Kant's beginning work on his major work, <span class=\"book\">Critique of Pure Reason</span>, in 1769 and the publication of its authoritative second edition in 1787 was the period of the immediate gestation of the French Revolution. But the Revolution was not bringing forth a clear new philosophical view of the world. On the contrary, supporters of the Revolution adhered to divers schools of philosophy, hardly even able to speak the same philosophical language.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKant lived in the <a href=\"../../places/p/r.htm#prussia\">Prussia</a> of Frederick the Great, an absolutist monarch who raised Prussia to the status of a European power in which the arts and sciences flourished, but where politcal life was virtually totally absent. A contemporary of Goethe, the great composer, scientist and philosopher, Kant was in his earlier years also absorbed with scientific problems and developed important ideas of the evolution of the Solar System, Galaxies, and the retardation of the rotation of the Earth by the tides. During this period he tended towards empiricism and was influenced by the Scepticism of David Hume.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, from when he began work on what was to become the <span class=\"book\">Critique of Pure Reason</span> (his later works were <span class=\"book\">Critique of Practical Reason</span> and <span class=\"book\">Critique of Judgment</span>), Kant became intensely dissatisfied with the state of war which seemed to exist in philosophy, and took upon himself the task of resolving this conflict.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThree readings from the <span class=\"book\">Critique of Pure Reason</span> are included in the Reference Archive:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nFrom the last section, <em>Transcendental Doctrine of Method</em>, a short piece is included which gives a glimpse of the genesis of Kant's views, including a concise criticism of his former mentor, David Hume:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/reason/ch04.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Impossibility of a Sceptical Satisfaction of Pure Reason</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nFrom the Introduction, the opening pages, in which Kant unfolds the principle concepts of his system:&nbsp;synthetic and analytic judgments, a priori and a posteriori, etc.: <em><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/reason/ch01.htm\" target=\"_top\">Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nFrom about a quarter of the way through the <span class=\"book\">Critique</span>, the section entitled <em><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/ethics/kant/reason/ch02.htm\" target=\"_top\">Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding</a>,</em> where the consequences, so to speak, of Kant's approach are brought out.

He was incarcerated at the Jalpaiguri jail, where he came into contact\r\nwith the communist leaders, most notably, with <a href=\"../../../glossary/people/m/a.htm#mazumdar-charu\">Charu Mazumdar</a>. Upon his release, Sanyal joined the CPI and worked\r\nto organize peasants and tea plantation workers in the Darjeeling district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in this district that the Naxalbari uprising broke out in 1967, after a sharecropper was attacked over\r\na land dispute with the landlord.

Senyal and Mazumdar formed the AICCCR in 1967. The movement would inspire the creation\r\nof the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) in 1969, which Sanyal announced on 22 April, Lenin’s birthday, in Calcutta. \r\nThe Party was to wage a <a href=\"../../../glossary/terms/g/u.htm#guerrilla-war\">guerrilla war</a> for seizure of power. This line was pushed by its chief ideologue Mazumdar,\r\nin opposition to Sanyal who in his <i>Report on the Movement of Terai Peasants</i> held that an agrarian program and mass\r\norganizations were necessary. Thus, the Sanyal-wing focused on the democratization of the organization in rural areas.\r\nIn <i>More on Terai Movement</i>, he stated that the peasants wanted the right to till the land, rather than capture state power. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanyal was arrested in 1970 and spent 7 years in an Andhra Pradesh jail, after having been convicted in\r\nthe Parvatipuram case, which saw uprisings against landlords in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Upon his release,\r\nSanyal denounced the armed struggle and accepted <a href=\"../../../glossary/terms/p/e.htm#peaceful-road\">parliamentary democracy</a>. \r\nHe formed the Organizing Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (OCCR), which in 1985 merged with \r\nthe Communist Organization of India (Marxist-Leninist), with Sanyal as its leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, Sanyal, who was also the Bengal Tea Garden Labor Union General Secretary at the time,\r\nwas arrested for staging a ‘rail-roko’ that disrupted the Delhi-bound train for 20 minutes at \r\nthe New Jalpaiguri railway station, to protest the failure to hold talks between the management of \r\na tea garden and the laborers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Sanyal suffered a stroke, after which his health began deteriorating further. \r\nHe refused to leave his village and go to Calcutta for treatment.

        "content": "\r\nKarl Kautsky (16 October 1854-17 October 1938), was one of the best-known theoreticians of the Second International and until 1914 he was thought by many socialists to be the veritable &#8220;Pope of Marxism.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p> Karl Kautsky was born in 1854 in Prague, the son of an Austrian mother and  a Czech father. His father, Johann Kautsky, was a painter and his mother, Minna Jaich Kautsky, a novelist and actress whose novels were admired by Engels. The family moved to Vienna when he was seven years old and after the elite Vienna Gymnasium (Grammar School) he attended the University of Vienna in 1874, joining the Austrian Social Democratic party in 1875 and working as a journalist for them. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in Zurich who were supported financially by Karl Höchberg and who smuggled socialist material into the Reich at the time of the Anti-Socialist Laws. Influenced by <a href=\"../b/e.htm#eduard-bernstein\">Eduard Bernstein</a>, Höchberg&#8217;s secretary, he became a Marxist and in 1881 visited Marx and Engels in England.</p>\r\n<p>In 1883 he founded the monthly <em><a href=\"../../periodicals/d/i.htm#die-neue-zeit\">Die Neue Zeit</a></em> in Stuttgart which became a weekly in 1890 and was its editor until 1917. The journal became immensely influential intellectually in socialist circles both in Germany and internationally. From 1885 to 1890 he worked with Engels in London and while there he published <em>Karl Marx&#8217; ökonomische Lehren</em>, later translated in 1925 as <em>The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx</em> which was probably the most widely read Marxist work on economics among <a href=\"../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp\">SDP</a> activists. It was so influential that long after Lenin had denounced him as a renegade it was still being used at the Moscow Lenin School in 1931 as by far the best treatment of the subject. Unfortunately his work on the French Revolution, <em>Die Klassengegensätze von 1789</em> (1889, 2nd ed. 1908), written at the same time, has never been translated into English.</p>\r\n<p>He went back to Vienna in 1890 where he married his second wife Luise Ronsperger (1864-1944) who was later to die in Auschwitz and, after the repeal of the German Anti-Socialist Law, they went to live in Stuttgart. His draft of the SPD programme, approved by Engels, was accepted at the Erfurt Congress in 1891 and became another of his highly influential publications and at least three different translations into English were made of it. He started to develop a Socialist agrarian programme. His main work on this, <em>The Agrarian Question</em>, has only been recently translated (1998) and is still in copyright so not available here on the MIA. After the death of Engels, to whom he was closer than he had been to Marx, he wrote a warm tribute to him.</p>\r\n<p>In 1896 he polemicised with <a href=\"../../../archive/bax/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Belfort Bax</a> on the Marxist conception of history and in 1897 moved with his family to Berlin and in a series of articles in his paper called for participation of the SPD in the Prussian elections despite the disgracefully undemocratic constitution. The electoral process could be used a tribune to raise the consciousness of the workers and recruit them to socialism. In 1898 he took up the question of colonialism and the nationalities question in Austria. On colonialism he was one of the first Marxists to see its importance and to take an intransigent stand against it. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position in the later 1890s, later translated as <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/bernstein/works/1899/evsoc/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><em>Evolutionary Socialism</em></a> (1908) Kautsky denounced him in articles and in an important book, <em>Bernstein und das sozialdemokratische Programm</em>, Stuttgart, 1899. Again there is no English translation of this very important work though there is a French one, <em>Le Marxisme et son critique Bernstein</em>. Kautsky correctly perceived that Bernstein&#8217;s emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the &#8220;progressive&#8221; bourgoisie and a non-class approach though in fact Bernstein&#8217;s approach to colonial questions would not strike many people today as excessively ethical. Kautsky thus appeared as the intellectual leader of the revolutionary left wing of the SPD though the growth of the Trade Union fraction was making the party more and more inclined to reformism. However it takes two to tango and the Imperial and Prussian governments showed not the slightest inclination to yield to democratic pressure from an opposition with the mildest of demands. In that situation it was possible for Kautsky to maintain his revolutionary credentials since there was little prospect of a viable reformist current in Wilhemine Germany. Above all Kautsky was opposed to non-working class alliances in the Imperial German situation.</p>\r\n<p>In 1901 he handed over his ownership of <em>Die Neue Zeit</em> to the SPD while remaining editor. As an internationalist he opposed Socialist support for foreign tariffs and protection which he felt was at the expense of working class living standards. The SPD was less successful in influencing the Catholic than the Protestant working class and so he analysed the reactionary policies of the Catholic Church. In 1904 and 1905, under the influence of Russian events, Kautsky, although far more cautious than Rosa Luxemburg, argued against the SPD right wing that the whole question of the mass strike should be studied and not dismissed. However he never advocated such a mass strike in any specific situation &#8211; his demand that it should be considered as an option remained quite abstract though in theory he advocated a joint parliamentary and direct action approach in the Imperial German state to press for democratic reforms with the proviso that such action should have a good chance of success. At the Congress of the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-international\">Second International</a> at Stuttgart in 1907 he successfully attacked the pro-colonialist faction. <em>The Foundations of Christianity</em> was written in 1908. <em>Der Weg zur Macht</em>, (1909) translated as <a href=\"../../../archive/kautsky/1909/power/index.htm\"><em>The Road To Power</em></a>, and praised by Lenin, is sometimes thought to be his most &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; work. There is a poorer older version but an excellent new translation by Meyer (1996) exists which it is still in copyright and is available in many libraries.</p>\r\n<p>Up to the outbreak of World War One, in addition to writing on themes already mentioned, he dealt with new questions such as anti-Semitism and inflation as well as articles on Finance Capital, Imperialism and national rivalries together with improved scholarly editions of Marx. His theories on imperialism, for over time his position changed, differed somewhat from that of Lenin. In particular he did not seem to believe that imperialism would drive to war, rather he saw it as a reactionary social phenomenon which appealed to the decaying class of the aristocracy and some marginal capitalist ones and was doomed. Only a fraction of the great mass of articles that he had written up to this point were translated into English and since many of the analyses were brilliant, even if he had much less to say on tactics, they deserve to be made available to a larger international audience as only through the medium of English can the largest number of people be reached today.</p>\r\n<p>In 1914 the crisis struck and war was declared. At the meeting of the Reichstag caucus on 3 August 1914 which decided to vote for the war credits next day, Kautsky, not a member of the Reichstag himself, stated that the character of the war could not be determined, and therefore the right to defence of the fatherland had to apply to all countries involved in the war. He wanted the Party to demand from the government an assurance that it wanted no conquests, and if the government agreed the war credits should be approved, if not, not. This course of action was clearly utopian. He was utterly unprepared for the horror as he had increasingly tended to believe, as his pre-war theories of &#8220;Ultra Imperialism&#8221; suggest, that capitalism was sufficiently rational not to go to war. In June 1915, about ten months the war had began and when it had become obvious that this was going to be long sustained and appallingly costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Bernstein and Haase against the right and denounced the government&#8217;s annexationist aims. The SPD was dominated by its pro-war and Trade Union wing and tried to muzzle him so eventually Kautsky reluctantly split in 1917 and, together with Bernstein and Haase, joined the USPD as its right wing. In June 1917, after the first revolution in Russia he stated that this should lead to democracy but not to socialism since Russia was too undeveloped economically so Socialism would have to wait. In September 1917 the SPD dismissed him as editor of <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>. By this time he was becoming a more marginal figure as the &#8220;storm of the world&#8221; was crushing the SPD &#8220;centre&#8221; and strengthening the left of Luxemburg and Liebknecht. The collapse of the Imperial state in 1918 through military defeat and immense working class privation threw up a real revolutionary situation for which he was quite unprepared theoretically.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after the <a href=\"../../events/o/c.htm#october\">Bolshevik revolution</a> he denounced, in the <em><a href=\"../../../archive/kautsky/1918/dictprole/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</a></em> (1918), all attempts to bring socialism forcibly to backward societies like Russia but he served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short lived SPD-USPD government revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany (<em>Die Deutschen dokumente zum Kriegsausbruch</em> ..., 1919, <em>The Guilt of Wilhelm Hohenzollern</em>, also 1919). In response to Lenin&#8217;s accusations of being a renegade he wrote <a href=\"../../../archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><em>Terrorism and Communism</em></a> in 1919.</p>\r\n<p>After 1919 he became steadily less important. He visited Georgia in 1920 and wrote a book in 1921 on this Social Democratic country still independent of Soviet Russia and in 1920, when the USPD split, with a minority of that party he went back into the SPD. At the age of 70 he moved back to Vienna with his family in 1924 where he remained until 1938. In that period he continued his scholarship on the letters of Engels and his criticisms of Soviet Russia seeing that country as doomed by its inherent backwardness. He wrote something on \r\n<a href=\"../../terms/f/a.htm#fascism\">Fascism</a> after 1933 but he was also critical of the workers rising against Dollfuss in Vienna in 1934 but published his views anonymously and thus wrote about the Nazis in 1934 that &#8220;we should guard against overestimating the superiority of Hitler&#8217;s power&#8221; and that when capitalist democracy is threatened &#8220;we do not in any way regard ourselves as driven to the necessity of answering the destruction of democracy by an armed insurrection.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In 1938 he fled to Czechoslovakia at the time of Hitler&#8217;s Anschluss, and thence by plane to Amsterdam where he died in the same year. His memoirs, on which he was working were only completed up to 1883 and were published posthumously in 1960.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\nSee: <a href=\"../../../archive/kautsky/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Kautsky Archive</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Further Reading:<br />\r\nCarl Schorske, <em>German Social Democracy 1905-1917 &#8211; The development of the Great Schism</em>, Harvard Historical Studies, Harper and Torchbooks 1954.<br />\r\nDick Geary, <em>Karl Kautsky</em>, Manchester University Press, 1987.<br />\r\nJohn H.

In 1917, at the beginning of what he described as his &#8220;slow motion&#8221; conversion to Marxism, Kawakami wrote a series of articles on the question of poverty, entitled <em>Bimb&#333; monogatari</em> (<em>Tale of Poverty</em>), which created a sensation at the time and established him as an influential author. Criticisms of this book by Marxists, combined with the impact of the Rice Riots in Japan and the Russian Revolution, encouraged Kawakami to question his own assumptions and study Marx more earnestly. In the 1920s Kawakami presented his new, Marxist views in his journal <em>Research on Social Problems</em>. In the course of the decade he would produce an astounding volume of articles, pamphlets, and books on Marxist political economy. He resigned from his position at Kyoto Imperial University to become actively involved in the Communist movement. Eventually he was arrested for his activities and spent the years 1933 to 1937 in prison.

This program culminated in the &#8220;Proletarian University of Detroit,&#8221; within which Keracher was the most notable and popular teacher. It was here that Keracher came in contact with the Socialist publisher Charles H. Kerr.</p>\r\n<p>Through this work, Keracher became the leader of the Socialist Party in Michigan, while Michigan became the fastest-growing and most radical state organisation of the Party, frequently at odds with the more conservative national leadership. </p>\r\n<p>In August 1918, a group around Keracher launched <em>The Proletarian</em> (later, <em>Proletarian News</em>), adopting the principles of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB). However, the group became more aligned with the Bolsheviks and was expelled from the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in May, 1919. The ostensible reason for the expulsion was the Michigan section&#8217;s vehement antireligious stance which was contrary to the Party&#8217;s statutes.</p>\r\n<p>A few weeks later, in September 1919, Keracher participated in the founding of the Communist Party in Chicago. However, unlike most of those who were joining the Communist Party at this time, Keracher did not believe in an imminent Bolshevik Revolution in the United States. He opposed the Communist Party&#8217;s &#8220;underground&#8221; work and opposed the formation of Left unions.</p> \r\n<p>In January 1920, Keracher&#8217;s Michigan group (including those associated with the group who lived outside that state) was expelled from the Communist Party charged with &#8220;Menshevism.&#8221;  Whilst Keracher continued to support Bolshevism, he denied that socialism had been established in Russia. Six months later, in June 1920, the Michigan group formed the Proletarian Party, and Keracher remained the leader of the Proletarian Party for the rest of his life.</p>\r\n<p>John Keracher was the author of countless easy-to-read basic pamphlets, mainly on Marxist economics, as well as articles and editorials in <em>Proletarian News</em>. As the Proletarian Party grew, local branches emerged in at least 38 U.S. cities. Although there were branches on both coasts, its stronghold was still the industrial Midwest. </p>\r\n<p>The party achieved considerable impact through its emphasis on worker education, despite its relatively small size. Many of the party&#8217;s members graduated to become prominent labor leaders, especially in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The party is credited by some with inciting the 1937 Flint sit-down strike. </p>\r\n<p>Keracher was a gifted street speaker and indefatiguable lecturer, and his popularisations of Marxism were used, not only by his own Party, but by other socialist groups, the IWW and Free Thinking societies.</p>\r\n<p>Charles H. Kerr, wishing to retire, sold Keracher the controlling interest in his publishing house, and Keracher and his comrades mnanaged the firm, continuing its tradition as a broad, socialist press though very hard times.</p> \r\n<p>Keracher moved from Detroit to Chicago in the 1920s, moving to Los Angeles in the 1950s, where he died in 1958. The Proletarian Party finally disappeared in 1971. </p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/keracher/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">John Keracher Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After graduating from Cambridge (1875), he was a lecturer in moral science there (1884-1911) and then served as registrar of the university (1910-25). He was active in the foundation of the Economics Tripos at Cambridge. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKeynes&#8217;s most important contributions to economics were as a logician and methodologist. His two chief works are <span class=\"book\">Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic</span> (1884), which was popular for its clarity of expression and avoidance of mathematical symbolism, and his classic work on economic methodology, <span class=\"book\">The Scope and Method of Political Economy</span> (1891). This work categorised the various approaches to economics as inductive and deductive, with Keynes adopting a syncretistic position. At a time when the German-speaking world was engaged in the <span class=\"book\">Methodenstreit</span> (&quot;battle of methods&quot;) between the Austrian economic school led by Carl Menger, which advocated a deductive approach and stressed the importance of pure theory, and the followers of German economist Gustav Schmoller, who insisted on the importance of inductive studies, Keynes, by contrast, insisted that both induction and deduction were required. He felt that inductive reasoning provided the general premises upon which deduction had to be based and that deduction resulted in generalisations or laws which then had to be tested by inductive procedures. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKeynes was the father of the most influential economist of the 20th century, <a href=\"#keynes-john-maynard\">John Maynard Keynes</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His most important work, <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a></span> (1935-36), advocated a remedy for economic recession based on a government-sponsored policy of full employment. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKeynes was born into a moderately prosperous family of the professional elite. His <a href=\"#keynes-john-neville\">father</a> was an esteemed economic scholar and later academic administrator at the University of Cambridge. His mother, the daughter of a minister endowed with advanced opinions, was one of the first female graduates of the same university. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn obviously gifted youngster, though he had a somewhat delicate constitution, he excelled both as a mathematician and as a scholar of the classics and showed a talent for the management of student societies. His undergraduate essay on <span class=\"book\">The Political Philosophy of Edmund Burke</span> showed an early interest in political philosophy. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt King&#8217;s College, Cambridge, he blossomed as a polemical speaker, becoming president of the University Union Society. Gradually, as he came under the influence of Alfred Marshall, the leading Cambridge economist, his mathematical interests diminished, and his attachment to politics and economics increased. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nCambridge introduced Keynes to an important circle of writers and artists. The early history of Bloomsbury, that exclusive circle of the cultural elect, which counted among its members Leonard and Virginia Woolf, the painter Duncan Grant, and the art critic Clive Bell, centres upon Cambridge and the figure of Lytton Strachey. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter graduating from Cambridge, Keynes became a civil servant and moved to the India Office in Whitehall. His experience there formed the basis of his first major work, which is still the definitive examination of pre-World War I Indian finance and currency. He then returned to Cambridge, where he taught economics with great success until 1915. The onset of World War I brought him back to government employment, where he was daily concerned with the economic management of the war. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccompanying Lloyd George to the Versailles Peace Conference as an economic adviser, Keynes soon became so distressed at the political chicaneries of the proceedings and the unrealistic character of the reparations policies to be imposed upon a defeated Germany that his health deteriorated, and he resigned his post. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe composed the indictment of the Versailles settlement that by Christmas 1919 reached the bookstores as <span class=\"book\">The Economic Consequences of the Peace</span>. The permanent importance of this polemical essay lies in its economic analysis of the excessive weight of reparations upon the German economy and the improbability that they ever would be paid. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Cambridge, to which Keynes now returned, he was esteemed as the most brilliant student of Alfred Marshall and A.C. Pigou, the two eminent Cambridge economists. Although the tone of Keynes&#8217;s major writings in the 1920s was occasionally sceptical, he did not directly challenge the conventional wisdom of the period that held laissez-faire. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKeynes&#8217; <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/economics/keynes/1920/pure-induction.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Treatise on Probability</span></a>, published in 1920, was described by Bertrand Russell as \"the most important work on probability for 55 years\", and shows that if a hypothesis has even the smallest finite probability, then it can be transformed into cerainty by sufficiently many observations. In this way he sought to overcome Humean scepticism by the assertion that theoretcially grounded hypotheses need only be shown to have finite probability to form the basis of science and rational action. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKeynes&#8217; epistemology began from the British idealist utilitarian G. E. Moore, \"in which universals originate and exist only in the mind; and although a concept may be chosen by reason and art to describe a collection of imperfectly similar units, nevertheless, that concept cannot be assumed to exist in real life. ...Platonic metaphysics was ... manifested in the <span class=\"book\">Treatise</span> as the doctrine of rational intuition, ... our state of knowledge of practical affairs is not sufficient, except in trivial instances, ... but we can anticipate the future by seeing, in an artistic but rational way, that there is a pattern to the facts. ... Nevertheless, his world of elusive change is not consistent with utilitarianism, and Keynes criticised that doctrine repeatedly and without a word of qualification. Not only did the <span class=\"book\">Treatise</span> deny that there is any generally predictable connection between an action and its outcome, but even where the consequences were known, Keynes&#8217; ethics advocated &#8217;being good&#8217; rather than &#8217;doing good&#8217; ... Keynes referred to this doctrine as a logic of motives rather than of consequences.\" [from <span class=\"book\">The significance of Keynes&#8217; Idealism</span>, Athol Fitzgibbons] </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1925 he opposed England&#8217;s return to the gold standard at the pre-war dollar-pound ratio of $4.86; and, long before the Great Depression, supported the Liberal Party&#8217;s program of public works to take the unemployed off welfare. But respectable economists still relied upon the expected automatic adjustments of the free market. Since Keynes could not yet offer a theoretical refutation of his colleagues&#8217; opinions, his agitation for public works had little political effect. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs a journalist he extended his reputation, writing in the <em>New Statesman</em>, <em>The Times</em> and the <em>Manchester Guardian</em>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the United States Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s 1932 landslide presidential victory over Herbert Hoover attested to the political bankruptcy of laissez-faire as an antedote to the Great Depression. Keynes&#8217; enduring triumph was his composition in the early 1930s of the most influential treatise composed by an economist thus far in this century, comparable to Adam Smith&#8217;s <span class=\"book\">Wealth of Nations</span> and Malthus&#8217; <span class=\"book\">Essay on Population</span>. The <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a></span>, which appeared in 1935-36, is a highly technical, even abstruse exposition of new ideas that had been partly foreshadowed in his <span class=\"book\">Treatise on Money</span> (1930).The central message is that in a depression, there was no wage so low that it could eliminate unemployment. Accordingly, it was wicked to blame the unemployed for their plight and explained the origins of unemployment and depression by aggregate demand - i.e., the total spending of consumers, business investors, and public agencies. When aggregate demand was low, sales and jobs suffered. When it was high, all was well. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom these generalities there flowed a powerful and comprehensive view of economic behaviour. Because consumers were limited in their spending by the size of their incomes, they were not the source of business cycle fluctuations. The dynamic actors were business investors and governments. In depressions the thing to do was either to enlarge private investment or to create public substitutes for private investment deficiencies. In mild economic contractions, monetary policy in the shape of easier credit and lower interest rates just might stimulate business investment and restore the aggregate demand caused by full employment. Severer contractions required as therapy the sterner remedy of deliberate public deficits either in the shape of public works or subsidies to afflicted groups. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring World War II and after, one Western country after another affirmed its new commitment to maintain high employment. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe <span class=\"book\">General Theory</span> was Keynes&#8217;s last major written work. In 1937 he suffered a severe heart attack. Two years later, though not completely recovered, he returned to teaching at Cambridge, wrote three influential articles on war finance entitled <span class=\"book\">How to Pay for the War</span>, and served once more in the Treasury as an all-purpose adviser. As the war drew to a victorious conclusion, Keynes turned his thoughts to the design of international financial institutions calculated to limit the spread of depression. At the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 he played a prominent part. But the institutions that resulted from the conference, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - two agencies that survive into the 1980s - bear much stronger marks of the orthodox theories of the United States Treasury of that time than of Keynes&#8217;s thinking. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis last major public service was his brilliant negotiation in the autumn and early winter of 1945 of a multibillion-dollar loan granted by the United States to England. He was now both a member of the Court of the Bank of England and, as Lord Keynes of Tilton, a peer of the realm. Keynes died in 1946. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/economics/keynes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">J M Keynes Archive</a> and <a href=\"../../../archive/pilling/works/keynes/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Crisis of Keynesian Economics, A Marxist View</a> (Geoff Pilling, 1986).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../k.htm\">Index of the Letter K</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

        "content": "\n<p>British Marxist historian, who specialised in world history and the history of Empire, alongside historical interests in numerous areas of history, politics and literature. </p>\n<p>Victor Gordon Kiernan, was a British Marxist historian, known for his general studies of the history of Imperialism, Empire and World History. Kiernan was an excellent general historian, who wrote on numerous historical areas and on numerous historical subjects, particularly in intellectual history and political history. His work covered the history of Empire, but also ancient history, Horace, Urdu poetry, Shakespeare, Religion, Methodism and the French Revolution, the Spanish Revolution of 1854, the social struggles of the seventeenth-century, mercenaries, the history of armies, elites in history, British diplomacy, British diplomatic history in China and India, tobacco, the history of the United States, the history of Great Britain, and the history of European Empires in the nineteenth-century and twentieth-century. A committed and life-long Marxist and socialist, Kiernan was an outstanding figure among British left-wing historians in the twentieth-century. </p>\n<p>Professionally, Kiernan was a writer and a historian, teaching history in India between 1938 and 1946, and at the University of Edinburgh from 1948 until his retirement in 1977. As a historian he was a generalist but specialised in the history of Empire and the history of the World after 1500.</p>\n<p>Kiernan was born in Ashton-on-Mersey, Manchester, United Kingdom, in 1913. His parents came from a religious and non-conformist background. His father, John Edward Kiernan, was a translator for the Manchester Ship Canal, specialising in Spanish and Portuguese.  Kiernan was educated at Manchester Grammar School. An excellent student of Classics and Languages, Kiernan won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he completed his tertiary education, gaining a double-starred First in History (B.A.,1934; M.A., 1937). </p>\n<p>Following his education, Kiernan travelled to India in 1938, to teach at the Sikh National College and Aitchison College in Lahore, India (now Pakistan). He returned to Britain in 1946. In  1948, Kiernan was appointed to a teaching post in history at the University of Edinburgh. In 1970, Kiernan was made Professor of Modern History at Edinburgh. He retired in 1977. </p>\n<p>Politically, Kiernan was a Socialist, a Communist and a Marxist. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1934, over the  struggle against Fascism, the nature of the Great Depression and his belief that Britain&#8217;s capitalist elites had betrayed the interests of Britain&#8217;s working poor in the Depression years and been weak and cowardly in failing to properly confront Fascism in Europe.  During his time in India, Kiernan remained involved in Party work, particularly in delivering messages from the CPGB and the Comintern to the Communist Party of India, and in establishing Marxist study groups among Indian students.  Kiernan remained in the CPGB until 1959, when he left over his lingering disgust over the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Despite this Kiernan remained a Marxist and a socialist. </p>\n<p>During his membership of the CPGB, Kiernan was heavily involved in the Communist Party Historians Group &#8211; a group of CPGB members interested in history and historical discussion. Kiernan was a vital and energetic member of the group from 1946  until 1959.  During his time in the CPGB, over 25 years, he was a well-liked and respected member, especially by the other historians in the CPGB.  E.J. Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson  and Rodney Hilton, all noted Kiernan as among the best of the British Marxist historians produced by the twentieth-century.  After leaving the CPGB, Kiernan was heavily involved in left-wing historical groups and debates.</p>\n<p>Kiernan was a very prolific historian. His first two books, published in 1939, were studies of British diplomacy in China during the first half of the 1880s (<em>The Dragon and St. George</em> and <em>British Diplomacy in China, 1880 to 1885</em>). These were followed up by numerous other books, articles, essays and historical reviews, across his long and prolific career. A key work of his, which appeared in 1969, was  <em>Lords of Human Kind</em>, a study of European Empires from 1500 to 1914 and their impact on social relations in the world, particularly European attitudes towards the rest of the World.  In this book Kiernan charted the impact of capitalism and imperialism on the modern world, particularly on the development of modern racism and modern social structures. The book, a classic since publication, has gone on to be a defining book of historical studies of the European Empires of the nineteenth-century. Kiernan&#8217;s work on Empire famously de-constructed the economic and social basis of Imperialism to show its disastrous effects on the modern world.  Other key works by Kiernan included a study of European duellists and duelling (<em>The Duel in European History</em>), a short history of the United States and U.S. Imperialism (<em>America: From White Settlement to World Hegemony</em>), biographies of Horace and Shakespeare (<em>Horace:Poetics and Politics</em>,  <em>Shakespeare: Poet and Citizen</em>), multiple studies of Western Imperialism (<em>Marxism and Imperialism: Studies</em>,  <em>European empires from conquest to collapse, 1815-1960</em>, and <em>Imperialism and its contradictions) </em>and a history of Tobacco <em>(Tobacco: A History). </em>As stated most of Kiernan&#8217;s work involved historical subjects after 1500 and after the establishment of European overseas Empires after 1492.</p>\n<p>Kiernan was also heavily involved in the founding of the left-wing Historical Journal <em>Past and Present</em>. In the first issue he contributed a ground-breaking study of the role of Methodism in Great Britain during the period of the French Revolution of 1789-1815 (<em>Evangelicalism and the French Revolution</em>). From this he contributed numerous other articles and essays to the journal, including studies of Mercenaries in late Feudal Societies (<em>Foreign Mercenaries and Absolute Monarchy</em>), and a study of seventeenth-century European societies (<em>State and Nation in Western Europe</em>). Kiernan also published extensively on historical and political subjects in the <em>New Left Review</em> and the <em>Socialist Register</em>.  Many of these essays dealt with the later history of Imperialism and Colonialism, and the final falls of the Spanish, Portuguese, and British Empires. </p>\n<p>Kiernan&#8217;s historical work is primarily known for its breadth and his extensive historical interests. His writing style combined the best of the Marxist approach to history with the best of the British literary tradition. Kiernan&#8217;s work was not limited by historical period or historical genre. He was a genuine master of all areas of history and historical research.</p>\n<p>Kiernan&#8217;s most pioneering work was primarily in the area of European Imperialism and European Empires in the nineteenth-century. His classic study of the social relationships in the European Empires, <em>Lords of Human Kind</em> (1969), remains a classic historical study of both the origins and impacts of European Imperialism and European Empire. <em>Lords of Human Kind</em> remains his most well-known work.</p>\n<p>Kiernan was also a committed literary scholar and was an expert in Urdu poetry. Kiernan was particularly familiar with the poetry of  Ghalib (1796-1869),  Iqbal (1877-1938), and Faiz (1911-1984), some of the most important Poets to emerge from the Indian sub-continent. In his career Kiernan produced ground-breaking translations of the poems of both Iqbal and Faiz; which helped to popularise both writers among readers in the West and to expand literary interest in the West for the Indian sub-continent. Kiernan was a great proponent of the idea that good literature belonged to the whole of humanity, and was not simply limited to the Western canon.</p>\n<p>Kiernan&#8217;s career as a historian was one of the most productive and most wide-ranging  in the historical profession. His work is still highly regarded as some of the finest produced in the Marxist tradition and his studies of Empire and Imperialism, especially, have yet to be rivalled.  He remained committed to the ideals of socialism.</p>\n<p>In his private life Kiernan was married twice. His first marriage, to the Indian dancer Shanta Gandhi,  lasted from 1938 to 1946, and ended in divorce. His second marriage: to the Canadian scholar Heather Massey,  lasted from 1984 until his death in 2009. \n<p>Kiernan died at his home in Stow, Scotland, on the 17th February 2009. He was aged 95.</p>\n<p>Selected Publications: <em>The Dragon and St. George: Anglo-Chinese relations 1880-1885</em> (1939), <em>British Diplomacy in China, 1880 to 1885</em> (1939), <em>Poems from Iqbal, Translation</em> (1955), <em>The Revolution of 1854 in Spanish History</em> (1966), <em>The Lords of Human Kind.

His parents died when he was young and he was brought up by his grandmother until he was seven when he was sent to an orphanage.</p>\n<p>\nAt the Kazan Technical School he became a Marxist and joined the Social Democratic Party in 1904. He took part in the 1905 Revolution in St. Petersburg. He was arrested but was released after three months in prison. </p>\n<p>\nKirov now joined the Bolshevik faction of the Social Democratic Party. He lived in Tomsk where he was involved in the printing of revolutionary literature. He also helped to organize a successful strike of railway workers. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1906 Kirov moved to Moscow but he was soon arrested for printing illegal literature. Several of his comrades were executed but he was sentenced to three years in prison. The prison had a good library and during his stay he took the opportunity to improve his education.</p>\n<p>\nKirov returned to revolutionary activity after his release and in 1915 he was once again arrested for printing illegal literature. After a year in custody he moved to the Caucasus where he stayed until the abdication of Nicholas II in March, 1917. </p>\n<p>\nAfter the October Revolution Kirov was sent to fight the anti-Bolshevik forces in the Caucasus. He fought in the Red Army until the defeat of General Anton Denikin in 1920.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1921 Kirov was put in charge of the Azerbaijan party organization and the following year helped organize the Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.</p>\n<p>\nKirov loyally supported Joseph Stalin and in 1926 he was rewarded by being appointed head of the Leningrad party organization. He joined the Politburo in 1930 and now one of the leading figures in the party, and many felt that he was being groomed for the future leadership of the party by Stalin.</p>\n<p>\nIn the summer of 1932 Joseph Stalin became aware that opposition to his policies were growing. Some party members were publicly criticizing Stalin and calling for the readmission of Leon Trotsky to the party. When the issue was discussed at the Politburo, Stalin demanded that the critics should be arrested and executed. Kirov, who up to this time had been a staunch Stalinist, argued against this policy. When the vote was taken, the majority of the Politburo supported Kirov against Stalin. </p>\n<p>\nIn the spring of 1934 Kirov put forward a policy of reconciliation. He argued that people should be released from prison who had opposed the government's policy on collective farms and industrialization. Once again, Joseph Stalin found himself in a minority in the Politburo. </p>\n<p>\nAfter years of arranging for the removal of his opponents from the party, Joseph Stalin realized he still could not rely on the total support of the people whom he had replaced them with. Stalin no doubt began to wonder if Kirov was willing to wait for his mentor to die before becoming leader of the party. Stalin was particularly concerned by Kirov's willingness to argue with him in public. He feared that this would undermine his authority in the party.</p>\n<p>\nAs usual, that summer Kirov and Joseph Stalin went on holiday together. Stalin, who treated Kirov like a son, used this opportunity to try to persuade him to remain loyal to his leadership. Stalin asked him to leave Leningrad to join him in Moscow. Stalin wanted Kirov in a place where he could keep a close eye on him. When Kirov refused, Stalin knew he had lost control over his protégé.</p>\n<p>\nSergei Kirov was assassinated by a young party member, Leonid Nikolayev, on 1st December, 1934. Stalin claimed that Nikolayev was part of a larger conspiracy led by Leon Trotsky against the Soviet government. This resulted in the arrest and execution of Genrikh Yagoda, Lev Kamenev, Gregory Zinoviev, and fourteen other party members who had been critical of Stalin.</p>\n<p>\nIn <em>The Granat Encyclopaedia of the Russian Revolution</em> Kirov wrote:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\nThe prison library was quite satisfactory, and in addition one was able to receive all the legal writings of the time. The only hindrances to study were the savage sentences of courts as a result of which tens of people were hanged. On many a night the solitary block of the Tomsk country prison echoed with condemned men shouting heart-rending farewells to life and their comrades as they were led away to execution. But in general, it was immeasurably easier to study in prison than as an underground militant at liberty. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/\">Spartacus Schoolnet</a>.</p>\n\n"

In his political life he straddled the gap between the\nfirst and second internationals, between the German refugee socialists in\nLondon and the workers of the East End, and between the anarchists and\ncommunists of the first British socialist parties. After the collapse of the\nSocialist League he settled as a confirmed anarchist. He died in 1923.  </p>\n\n<p>Frank Kitz's first political involvement was with the Democratic\nand Trades Alliance, the last remnant of the First International in England. By\n1874 he was their secretary.  In 1875 he also became Secretary of the Manhood\nSuffrage League<p> In 1877 he formed the English Revolutionary Society as part of the Social\nDemocratic Club, intended to form a bridge between the English working class and\nthe mainly German social-democratic refugees. During this period he became\nstrongly influenced by the Blanquist Johann Most, and edited a\nshort-lived English language version of Most's newspaper, <em>Freiheit</em>. In\n1881 he was the English delegate to the Social Revolutionary and\nAnarchist Congress.  </p> \n\n<p> Shortly after this he changed direction and together with\nJoseph Lane founded the Labour Emancipation League, a propagandist group\nworking mainly in the East End, with a programme combining historic chartist\ndemands for full suffrage and free education with a call for nationalisation of\nlanded property. The Labour Emancipation League spent a short and unhappy\nperiod affiliated to the Social Democratic Federation, merging with the\nSocialist League when this split from the SDF.  </p> \n\n<p>Kitz was a key member of the Socialist League, founding\nmany new branches, organizing meetings and giving talks. As party secretary\nhe acted as a bridge between William Morris and the more extreme anarchists, while\nremaining firmly convinced of the correctness of anti-parliamentarianism. Kitz\nand Morris were the two SL organizing committee delegates to the 1889 Paris\nCongress of the Second International; both spoke. As the factionalism within\nthe Socialist League increased, Kitz temporarily took over editorship of the\nCommonweal from Morris. When the anarchists finally drove Morris out of the\nparty, Kitz left soon afterwards. After a period outside politics, he\nre-emerged as a speaker for the Freedom group of anarchists in the 1900s.

Such sensations are formed under the influence of an intrinsic faculty to create simple, symmetrical and closed figures according to immanent subjective laws. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKoffka was associated with the University of Giessen (1911-24) and served as a subject (1912), along with K&ouml;hler, in experiments on perception conducted by Wertheimer. Their findings led Koffka, Wertheimer, and K&ouml;hler to stress the holistic approach that psychological phenomena cannot be interpreted as combinations of elements: parts derive their meaning from the whole, and people perceive complex entities rather than their elements. Gestalt psychology drew upon the methods of <a href=\"../../people/h/u.htm#husserl-edmund\">Edmund Husserl</a> and the ideas of <a href=\"../../people/m/a.htm#mach-ernst\">Ernst Mach</a> and the <a href=\"../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle\">Vienna Cricle</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKoffka conducted a great amount of experimental work, but he is perhaps best known for his systematic application of Gestalt principles to a wide range of questions. One of his major works, <span class=\"book\">The Growth of the Mind</span> (1921), applied the Gestalt viewpoint to child psychology and argued that infants initially experience organised wholes in the barely differentiated world about them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1924 Koffka began a series of visits to several American universities, and in 1927 he was appointed professor of psychology at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., where he remained for the rest of his life. A major work, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/koffka.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Principles of Gestalt Psychology</span></a> (1935), dealt with a wide range of applied psychology but contributed mainly to the study of perception, memory, and learning.</p>\r\n\r\n"

Born in Russia and educated in Berlin, he lectured on Hegel's <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes in Paris from 1933-1939. After World War Two, Koj&egrave;ve abandoned philosophy and took up an Economic planning post representing France in the Common Market, until his death in 1968.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn  1947 his lectures were published as <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/kojeve.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Introduction to the Reading of Hegel</span></a>. He was the first to attempt to combine Marx, Hegel and  Heidegger, and consequently he must be regarded as the most important source of the French post-War radicalism associated with <a href=\"../../people/s/a.htm#sartre-jean-paul\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, <a href=\"../../people/m/e.htm#merleau-ponty-maurice\">Maurice Merleau-Ponty</a>, <a href=\"../../people/d/e.htm#de-beauvoir-simone\">Simone de Beauvoir</a>, <a href=\"../../people/f/a.htm#fanon-frantz\">Frantz Fanon</a>, <em>et al</em>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKoj&eacute;ve's reading of Hegel focussed on the &#8220;master-slave dialectic&#8221;, and he re-cast the whole of Hegel's system around the concept of Recognition exhibited in the Master-Slave dialectic. The dialectic of recognition occupies only one small section in the <em>Phenomenology</em>, but in Hegel's first systematic work, <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hegel/seindex.htm\" target=\"_top\"><em>System of Ethical Life</em></a> (1802), recognition plays a central role in the development of mediation. So in this sense, Koj&egrave;ve may be said to be true to Hegel.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith the rise of the social movements after World War Two, this theme became the central axis of Continental philosophy. Koj&egrave;ve traces Hegel's philosophy from Aristotle and Plato, and understands Hegel's dialectic as a summing up of the development of objective products of human culture, rather than the work of Spirit. Koj&egrave;ve insisted that history had come to an end and that now nothing really new can happen in the world - reality has become rational. Koj&egrave;ve carried this conclusion into practice by abandoning philosophy and devoting the rest of his life to economic planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee his 1934 <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/dk/kierkega.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Introduction to the reading of Hegel</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kolchak was was admired by the aristocracy and bourgeoisie alike for possessing the &#8220;romantic\" traits of chivalry and duty to the King above all else, as the servant of god.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n As a young officer Kolchak had taken part in the dangerous Arctic explorations, and had fought with great bravery in the defense of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese war.  After the defeat of the Russian Navy, he led a small group of officers who reorganized the leading brass of Russia's Navy. His thorough and efficient work over the next decade were awarded with a promotion to Rear-Admiral at the very young age of 43.  By June 1916, when he was forty-four years old, Kolchak was appointed Vice-Admiral in command of the Black Sea Fleet, where he received acclaim for courage and efficiency in setting minefields close to Turkish shores.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Soviets grew in strength after the <a href=\"../../events/f/e.htm#february-revolution-1917\">February Revolution</a>, Kolchak refused to remain in the Navy and shortly emigrated to the United States and England.  He returned to Russia after the <a href=\"../../events/o/c.htm#october-revolution-1917\">October Revolution</a>, landing in the Far Eastern Siberian port of Vladivostok.  Kolchak publicly proclaimed his full support of England in its efforts to overthrow the Soviet government and was assigned to coordinate the military maneuvers of the various interventionist forces in the region. Ataman Semenov, also operating in the region, ignored Kolchak as did the Japanese.  Kolchak was undeterred, and set plans to gain command of the <a href=\"../../orgs/w/h.htm#white-army\"> White Army</a> in the Don region, but as he reached Omsk he was persuaded to join the newly established White government (\"the directory\") as Minister of War.  Shortly after his joining, on November 18 1918, while visiting the soldiers at the front, his czarist comrades overthrew the directory and appointed Kolchak supreme ruler and commander-in-chief, establishing an autocratic military dictatorship.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLandlords, accompanied by soldiers, took from the Siberian peasants what they had &#8220;seized for themselves\".  In factories, factory owner's returned with soldiers to forcibly remove workers' ownership of the factories.  Untold numbers of workers and peasants were shot, beaten, raped, and imprisoned.  All political factions who opposed Kolchak's dictatorship were imprisoned, including the right-wing of the Socialist revolutionary party, who at one time had been a part of the directory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe peasantry and workers of Omsk revolted on Dec. 21, 1918, outraged by the brutality of Kolchak and his overthrow of the directory.  A number of imprisoned right-wing Socialist revolutionaries were successfully liberated by the revolting population. To suppress the revolt, Kolchak ordered soldiers to open fire, killing over 300 unarmed civilians.  The people were successfully dispersed.  In the weeks following 166 civilians were shot dead for having ties to instigating the revolt.  The Socialist revolutionaries, who had been freed from imprisonment, gave themselves up in fear of reprisals.  They were promptly taken to the banks of the Irtysh River, and shot.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKolchak's military campaign was no less brutal. In late December 1918 a section of the Siberian Army, led by General Gajda under the command of Kolchak, marched westward over the Ural mountains and captured the city of Perm. The Red Army responded by a heroic crossing of the Volga River, liberating the towns of Ufa and Orenburg (directly south of Perm).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKolchak then unleashed a full offensive into southern Russia from Perm.  His 40,000 strong Western Army pushed back the Soviet 5th Army which held the city of Ufa, with less than 10,000 men and women in its defense.  After months of courageous fighting, the Soviet 5th Army was forced to fall back, and on March 13 Kolchak's Army occupied Ufa.  In the following weeks Kolchak continued to drive his armies farther into the heart of Russia, separating them to capture the two major ports on the Volga River: Kazan, 450 kilometers northwest of Ufa, and Samara (later renamed Kuybyshev), 400 kilometers southwest of Ufa.  In the North, the remnants of Kolchak's Northern Siberian Army left Perm and marched west, towards the large industrial city of Vyatka (later renamed Kirov), some 400 kilometers to the west.  If successful, Kolchak would establish a strong Eastern front, and would only have to rely on his British collaborators in the North, the French in the South West, and Denikin in the South to ensure the strangulation of the Soviet government from the peoples of Russia.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKolchak's advances, however, were halted not only by the Red Army, but also by the Russian peasantry who would not tolerate Kolchak's brutality.  As most of his forces were now West of the Urals, his dictatorship in Siberia began to crumble. While his officers in Siberia continued their brutal suppression of the peasantry, the soldiers under their command refused to carry out orders.  The supply lines to Kolchak soldiers in the West began to falter, and their morale began its steady decline, with soldiers defecting to the Red Army everyday.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the end of April, the Red Army began its counteroffensive.  Led by Mikhail Frunze, Kolchak's Western Army slowly began to fall back.  By June 9, the city of Ufa was liberated again, and Kolchak's armies were forced to flee east of the Ural mountains. The Red Army was relentless.  Kolchak's forces had bordered themselves up in the city of Chelyabinsk, but they could not withstand the force of the Red Army.  By November 14, 1919, almost a year to the day that Kolchak had established a military  dictatorship in Omsk, the Red Army, with the help of the revolting peasantry and the soldiers under Kolchak's command, liberated the city of Omsk.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn January, 1920, Kolchak proclaimed Denikin his successor as leader of the white armies.  Kolchak retreated east, attempting to flee Russia through Vladivostok, but was killed by the Red Army.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In 1913 he married Hedda Gagliardi, with whom he collaborated in political and theoretical work throughout his life. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nKorsch returned to Germany on the outbreak of war; he opposed the war but was conscripted and although he never carried a weapon, was twice decorated with the Iron Cross. He returned to lecture at Jena and in 1917 joined the Independent German Socialist Party (USPD), a left split from the social-chauvenist SPD, and when the USPD split, Korsch joined the Communist Party (KPD). Korsch participated actively in the revolutionary ferment of those years. During the height of the workers' uprising Korsch wrote hypothetical economic programs for a national economy based on workers' councils, emphasising workers' management of enterprises. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the decline of the movement, Korsch began to emphasise the need for ideological struggle, and criticised the objectivism of the Marxism, which he saw as having been inherited uncritically from the leadership of the Second International. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the time Korsch published his <a href=\"../../../archive/korsch/1923/marxism-philosophy.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Marxism and Philosophy</span></a>, Korsch was a member of the Th&uuml;ringian Provincial Parliament for the KPD and became Minister for Justice, with the specific aim of facilitating a planned Communist uprising.

He also opposed the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy and argued that the Comintern had become an instrument of Russian foreign policy. In the crisis that followed, Korsch tried to hold a middle position between the Comintern and a move to form a new party, but he found himself isolated. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter 1928, he continued to write, and began a close friendship with Bertolt Brecht which remained until Brecht's death in 1956. He fled Germany on the night of the Reichstag fire in 1933. Korsch continued to write on Marxism including the origins of Marx's thought from Hegel. From 1936 until his death in 1961 he lived in the US, working at the Institute for Social Research and collaborating with Kurt Lewin.<!-- By the early 1950s he was affected by increasing pessimism, but the death of Stalin and signs of change after Stalin's death revived his hopes and his interest turned to events in the colonial world and in China.

Kritsman, possibly the best economist in the Bolshevik Party, with a short-lived career since he withdrew from active political life by the early thirties and almost certainly died in the purges.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKritsman was expelled from the University of Odessa in 1910 when he was 20 and completed his studies abroad. On returning to Russia he joined the Bolshevik party in 1918 and was part of the bloc known as the Left Communists. &#8216;Left Communism had numerous adherents within the party&#8217; writes Sam Oppenheim. This faction which included Preobrazhensky, Bukharin, Kollontai, Obolensky [Osinsky], Pyatakov and many other Bolsheviks wanted immediate, full nationalisation and workers&#8217; control, were strong supporters of planning, and were especially strongly represented in the regional and local economic councils known as the sovnarkhozy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Kritsman is today mainly known for his studies of the countryside, he also wrote a major study of the economy of &#8216;War Communism&#8217; which Serge complained remained untranslated in any European language as late as 1930, describing the book as &#8216;a remarkable economic analysis&#8217;. (In fact, a German translation had appeared in 1929.) This work was called <i>The Heroic Period of the Great Russian Revolution</i>. Extracts from the German translation suggest a strong liking for hegelian terminology (as with Rubin&#8217;s work).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the main part of the 1920s he occupied various leading academic positions, including that of Professor of Economics at Moscow University. Under NEP and as a member of the Communist Academy, he pioneered a remarkable school of agrarian research which came to be known as the &#8216;Agrarian Marxists&#8217;. This dedicated itself to field studies of the renewed emergence of capitalism among Russian peasant households, using what he and his colleagues saw as more rigorously Marxist criteria of class differentiation. This aspect of Kritsman&#8217;s work later became the subject of a superb monograph by Terry Cox called Peasants, Class, and Capitalism (1986).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nK. believed that in a planned economy there were no &#8216;objective laws&#8217;. For him &#8216;mass creativity was the basic characteristic of communism&#8217;. He described the famous November 1917 decree on workers&#8217; control as &#8216;half-measures, therefore unrealisable&#8217;. What he meant by this was that it did not go far enough in enabling workers to start the process of managing enterprises as opposed to simply supervising existing capitalist managements. &#8216;It [the decree] was the implied expression of a weakness, still to be overcome, of the working class movement.&#8217; Osinsky, another Left Communist, wrote that the workers&#8217; control slogan &#8216;failed when it sought to convert itself into a system&#8217;. For K. collective management was the &#8216;specific, distinctive mark of the proletariat…distinguishing it from all other social classes…the most democratic principle of organisation&#8217;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe and the other Left Communists of 1918 were strongly opposed to Lenin&#8217;s tactical defense of &#8216;state capitalism&#8217; (a regime under which Lenin counted on &#8216;the cooperation of Russian capitalism and, even more so, of large foreign capitalist interests&#8217;, Lewin, Lenin&#8217;s Last Struggle, p. 26) and opposed to its various corollaries, above all, one-man management (the disavowal of workers&#8217; control even in the limited Russian sense of this term) and Lenin&#8217;s endorsement of Taylorism as &#8216;scientific and progressive&#8217;.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

While recalling how a conquered France had humbled herself before the Russian tzars, he did not foresee how a conquering France would humble herself before American bankers. He exclaimed: \"Are we going to live through the same thing? Not by any means!\" He was applauded by the entire hall. And then what rainbow prospects, he said, are opened by the war: \"All are beginning to understand that we must build a new life on new socialist principles. . . . Lloyd George is making speeches imbued with the socialist spirit. . . . In England, in France and in Italy, there is forming a new comprehension of life, imbued with socialism-unfortunately state socialism.\" If Lloyd George and Poincare have not yet \"unfortunately\" renounced the state principle, at least Kropotkin has come over to it frankly enough. \"I think,\" he said, \"that we will not be depriving the Constituent Assembly of any of its rights-I fully recognize that to it belongs the sovereign decision upon such questions-if we, the Council of the Russian land, loudly express our desire that Russia should be declared a republic.\" Kropotkin insisted upon a confederative republic: \"We need a federation such as they have in the United States.\" That is what Bakunin's federation of free communes had come down to! \"Let us promise each other at last,\" adjured Kropotkin in conclusion, \"that we will no longer be divided into the left and right halves of this theater. . We all have one fatherland, and for her we ought all to stand together, or to lie down together if need be, both Lefts and Rights.\" Landlords, industrialists, generals, Cavaliers of St. George, all those who did not recognize Zimmerwald, extended to the apostle of anarchism a well-earned ovation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\nLeon Trotsky, <a href=\"../../../archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch30.htm\">History of the Russian Revolution</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/kropotkin-peter/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Peter Kropotkin Archive</a>, and <a href=\"../../../subject/anarchism/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Anarchism Subject Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n"

Kuhn introduced the idea of a &#8220;Paradigm&#8221; which allows only certain kinds of questions to be asked about a science while excluding others, until contradictions build-up to a point where a sudden change of Paradigm takes place, and the whole science is rapidly reconstructed under the &#8220;new paradigm&#8221;. Kuhn developed a kind of sociology of scientific community to study how these paradigms both constrained and promoted the development of scientific knowledge. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter studying Physics at Harvard, Kuhn did his PhD in the history of science and subsequently taught and wrote on the history and philosophy of science at Harvard, the University of California (Berkeley), Princeton and M.I.T. until his retirement in 1991. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his first book, <span class=\"book\">The Copernican Revolution</span> (1957), Kuhn studied the development of the heliocentric theory of the solar system during the Renaissance. In his landmark second book, <span class=\"book\">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</span>, he generalised what he described in the first book. In a conception which is strongly reminiscent of Hegel&#8217;s conception of the development of knowledge, he argued that scientific research always works within a certain &#8220;paradigm,&#8221; or closed system of concepts and methods which exclude dissident views which cannot be fitted into the system. During such a period of &#8216;normality&#8217;, researchers simply refine theories and develop their implicaitons; puzzling or anomalous results or facts are simply excluded. Over time, however, the weight of these anomalies builds up and eventually trigger a crisis in which attention is suddenly turned to what was previously ignored, basic assumptions and long-held opinions are overthrown and eventually some new way forward emerges and the old system of ideas falls into disrepute and the whole science is again reworked under the new &#8220;paradigm&#8221;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKuhn was a part of a widespread movement interested in Cognitive Science in the post-World War Two period. While sharing an element of social-relativism with Structuralism and Functionalism, Kuhn's theory has the great benefit of disclosing the inner dynamic hidden within an social structure.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nItalian philosopher and socialist, father of Italian Marxism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLabriola was born in Cassino in 1843. He studied Hegelian philosophy at the University of Naples under Bertrando Spaventa, who saw in the new Italian State the realization of the Hegelian ideal. Spaventa&#8217;s brothers Bertrando and Silvio were also typical exponents of the historical right, liberal but not democratic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLabriola&#8217;s first published work was a critique of Zeller (a teacher of Greek philosophy at the University of Heidelberg), clearly inspired by Bertrando Spaventa&#8217;s Hegelianism. After studying under A. Tari, F. De Sanctis and B. Spaventa at the University of Naples, Labriola abandoned orthodox Hegelianism, writing in 1869 a sharp criticism of the Hegelian A. Vera&#8217;s <em>Lectures on the Philosophy of the History</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBetween 1870 and 1874 (before the fall of the Right), Labriola wrote for liberal political journals, such as <em>Gazzetta di Napoli</em>, <em>Il Piccolo</em>, <em>L&#8216;Unità Nazionale</em> and <em>Monitore di Bologna</em>. From these articles one can already notice Labriola&#8217;s concern to study in a concrete way the needs of the popular masses, particularly national education, understood as intellectual and moral reform, a topic that is found again and again in his philosophical writings of this period (<em>The Origin and nature of the passions in the Ethics of Spinoza</em> of 1866, the <em>The Doctrine of Socrates according to Senofonte, Platone and Aristotle</em> of 1871, the <em>On Moral freedom and the Morality of Religion</em>, both of 1873). In 1874 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy and Pedagogy at the University of Rome. Subsequently he lectured on philosophy, philosophy of history and pedagogy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLabriola progressively modified his ideas, separating Hegel&#8217;s historicism from his idealism, especially thanks to the ethical psychology of Johann Friedrich Herbart. State, religion and school became for Labriola the means to realise a progressive political strategy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTowards the second half of the 1880s, responding to the spontaneous People&#8217;s Movement which had grown up around the figure of Garibaldi, and then around Bakunin, Labriola began to move more and more to the left, convinced that a completely democratic revolution was possible only if it first of all went to the defence of the working masses (for Labriola, the urban working class). At first he was attracted to radicals like Clevises, then to Socialists like Turati. Labriola came see that the State was more and more captive of a decadent and corrupt bourgeoisie. Between 1880 to 1886 he lectured on the State, its origins and its functions. Progressively the idea matured in his mind that the true motive force of history is to be found in the political movement of the popular masses. That is in the society rather than in the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the period 1887 to 1890, he looked towards a process of democratic transformation of the State and civil society setting out from the Commune. He became convinced that &#8220;radical Jacobinism&#8221;, excluding the collective involvement of the broadest layers of society, in reality favoured just the radical elite. In short, he elaborated a strategy for building a base for social democracy that had as its characteristic element involvement in local government, rather than focussing on achieving popular self-government. In order to understand this phase of his thought, see <em>Problems of the Philosophy of History and Socialism</em> (1889).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAround 1890 he began to study the works of Marx and Engels and became convinced that in the modern world the most creative and revolutionary force is the working class Socialist movement. He entered into an intense correspondence with the leading exponents of European Socialism: Engels, Kautsky, Bernstein, Georges Sorel. He considered German Social Democracy to be a model for Italy, although he considered Italy to be a more backward nation. He was the main organiser of the May Day demonstrations in Rome in 1891. His <em>Essays on Historical Materialism</em> was not only the first work of Marxism to be written in Italy, but established Labriola as one of the greater European Marxist theorists of that time. The main feature of this work was its opposition to &#8220;Neo-Kantian Marxism\": proposing a choice between &#8220;ethical Marxism&#8221; and &#8220;scientific Marxism,&#8221; Labriola did not have doubts in preferring the second.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLabriola addressed himself to Turati, calling for the promotion of a true left-wing, proletarian socialism. Turati was the Socialist leader in the most modern city of Italy, Milan, and the editor of &#8220;Critica sociale&#8221; which began publication in 1891. The differences between the two were remarkable: Labriola wanted a small, homogenous, combative, Marxist party of workers; Turati wanted instead a broad party open to heterogenous elements, pragmatic and reformist. At the founding conference of  the party in Genoa in 1892, Turati responded to Labriola, in removing the anarchistic elements, but the program remained eclectic. However, Labriola succeeded in convincing Turati to engage the party in the defense of the Sicialian <em>movimento dei Fasci</em>. At this time the contrast between manufacturer-agrarian bloc of the dominant classes and opposition bloc of workers and peasants was not yet clearly delineated in the countryside. However in the party, because of its own theoretical ambiguities (&#8220;social-positivist,&#8221; Labriola would say), three opposing currents would very soon develop.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was for this reason that Labriola preferred to dedicate himself to theoretical studies, without tying himself to the organization. In his last years he was engaged in a debate which ignited on the legacy of Marxism, on its infuence in philosophy and on political strategy. Labriola saw in this debate much the same differences as he had earlier analysed in the comparison of Bernstein and Sorel and of Gentile and Croce. He died in 1904, but in 1927-28 his <em>Letters to Engels</em> were published.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis major works are:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\na) <em>In memory of &#8220;Communist Manifesto&#8221;</em> (1895), in which he asserts that <em>The Manifesto</em> has the form of a forecast, based on a genetic examination of the general crisis of nineteenth-century capitalism. Labriola preferred to use the term &#8220;genetic Marxism&#8221; rather than &#8220;dialectics&#8221; because &#8220;the dialectic,&#8221; was such a misused word, it could provide an opening through which some travesty of metaphysics could re-enter; On the other hand, he never spoke about &#8220;Scientific Socialism,&#8221; but always about &#8220;Critical Communism,&#8221; because of the danger of Positivism;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nb) <em>On historical materialism</em> (1896), in which he criticised the reduction of historical materialism to an abstract schema to be applied to reality, without taking account of the interdependence of the relationship of base to superstructure. History, Labriola said, providing the basis of Gramsci&#8217;s future reflections, can be understood as a complex social organism: it is impossible to understand it by studying economic processes alone, but requires also the study of social psychology;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nc) <em>Correspondence on Philosophy and Socialism</em> (1898), is a collection of 12 letters to Georges Sorel, in which the absurdity of Positivism&#8217;s fatalistic scientific-functional concept of social evolution is exposed. Here Labriola&#8217;s criticism was turned, in particular, to the Darwinist interpretations of the human development. It is in these letters that Labriola speaks for the first time about historical materialism as the &#8220;philosophy of the praxis&#8221;;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">\r\nd) <em>From One Century to the Next</em> (1900-1, published posthumously by Croce, who from his youth had been interested in Marxism thanks to Labriola). In this work, Labriola proposes that a true proletarian revolution could only be possible after capitalism had completed the entire cycle of its development, including expansion into the colonies. In an interview of 1902, of which a great fuss has been made, he expressed a favorable attitude Italian colonialism in Africa.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nTranslated by Andy Blunden from a biography by Enrico Galavotti, with minor alterations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTrotsky says in his autobiography, <em>My Life</em>:</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;It was in my cell <span class=\"context\">[in 1898]</span> that I read with delight two well-known essays by an old Italian Hegelian-Marxist, Antonio Labriola, which reached the prison in a French translation. Unlike most Latin writers, Labriola had mastered the materialist dialectics, if not in politics &#8211; in which he was helpless &#8211; at least in the philosophy of history. The brilliant dilettantism of his exposition actually concealed a very profound insight. He made short work, and in marvellous style, of the theory of multiple factors which were supposed to dwell on the Olympus of history and rule our fates from there.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;Although thirty years have gone by since I read his essays, the general trend of his argument is still firmly entrenched in my memory, together with his continuous refrain of &#8216;ideas do not drop from the sky.&#8217; After Labriola, all the Russian proponents of the multiplicity of factors, Lavrov, Mikhaylovsky, Kareyev, and others, seemed utterly ineffectual to me. Many years later I was wholly at a loss to understand some of the Marxists who had succumbed to the influence of the sterile treatise on &#8216;Economics and the Law,&#8217; written by the German professor, Stammler. It was just another of the innumerable attempts to force the great stream of natural and human history, from the amoeba to present-day man and beyond, through the closed rings of the eternal categories &#8211; rings which have reality only as marks on the brain of a pedant.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/labriola/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Antonio Labriola Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As head of the Clinic at the Faculty, he introduced Freudian practices to France; gained widespread recognition through a series of seminars he held at the Univesity of Paris in 1953; in 1964, he founded the L&#8217;&Eacute;cole Freudienne de Paris, but wound it up in 1980 because of its alleged failure to adhere strictly to Freudian principles.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was influenced by <a href=\"../k/o.htm#kojeve-alexander\">Alexander Koj&egrave;ve</a>&#8217;s lectures on Hegel in Paris and discussions with <a href=\"../s/a.htm#sartre-jean-paul\">Sartre</a> and <a href=\"../m/e.htm#merleau-ponty-maurice\">Merleau-Ponty</a>; he also translated <a href=\"../h/e.htm#heidegger-martin\">Heidegger</a>&#8217;s works into French, absorbing much of Heidegger&#8217;s views on language.

        "content": "\r\n<p>\r\n19th century English anti-parliamentarist socialist agitator, a founding member of the Social Democratic Federation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane was born in 1851 in the village of Benson near Wallingford, his father was a cordwainer and his mother was illiterate. Lane had virtually no education, and from an early age he worked on the land. At an early age he also developed an interest in radical politics. He later recalled that during the General Election of July 1865 he &#8220;attended all political meetings in Borough of Wallingford,&#8221; and questioned the successful Liberal candidate, Sir Charles Dilke, about the abolition of the Game Laws and the House of Lords.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane came to London soon where he witnessed the National Reform League demonstration in July 1866, when angry crowds broke into the park to establish the right of public meeting there an event which hastened the passage of the second Reform Bill, extending the vote to most working-class men in urban areas. In London, Lane worked as a carter, but he managed to fit an increasing amount of political activity into his spare time. During the early 1870s he seems to have been involved in the Land Tenure Reform Association led by the radical philosopher John Stuart Mill and in the republican campaign led by the radical politician Sir Charles Dilke. He was also later said to have belonged to an English section of the International Working Men&#8217;s Association and to have supported the Paris Commune in 1871, but this seems to derive from a misunderstanding of his later activities. There is no evidence that Lane began to move beyond radicalism before the end of the 1870s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy 1880, however, Lane was involved in several working-class organisations in central London which played an important part in the transition from radicalism to socialism on the British left. The first organisation was formed as the Democratic and Trades Alliance Association in 1874, and became the Manhood Suffrage League in 1875. Its members included several old Chartists, and from 1874 to 1877 its secretary was Frank Kitz, a leading activist in radical, socialist and then anarchist politics for nearly half a century. Lane is first recorded taking part in the discussion in the meetings at the Queen&#8217;s Head in Little Pulteney Street in January 1879. The second organisation was the English Section of the Social Democratic Club, which was formed by Kitz in 1877 to link native radicals and foreign (mainly German) socialists living in exile in London, and which acquired its own premises in Rose Street. Its German Section was dominated by Johann Most, a former Socialist Deputy in the Reichstag who produced <em>Die Freiheit</em>, which began as a socialist weekly in 1879 but turned towards anarchism during 1880. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe third organisation was the Marylebone Radical Reform Association, which was formed in 1879. In January 1880 Lane took the lead in forming its third branch, which held meetings at the Black Horse in Marylebone High Street, near his place of work in Paddington Street. This branch soon moved to the left, and changed its name to the Marylebone Radical Association in April 1880. The fourth organisation was called the Local Rights Association for Promoting Rental and Sanitary Reform, and was actually a front for even more radical activity in 1880.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the General Election of April 1880, which resulted in a landslide victory for the Liberal Party, Lane led the Marylebone radicals in pestering the two local Liberal candidates with traditional radical demands for Irish Home Rule, nationalisation of the land, and abolition of the House of Lords. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Marylebone radicals rejected a Conservative offer to pay for a radical candidate to split the Liberal vote. But a former Conservative called H.M. Hyndman did offer himself as an independent candidate, with a programme of liberalism at home and imperialism abroad, and he tried to get radical support too. Lane refused, later recalling that &#8220;I told him it was only a waste of time.&#8221; But when Gladstone&#8217;s new Liberal Government soon disappointed radical hopes, some of his comrades continued discussions with Hyndman, and the result was the formation in June 1881 of the Democratic Federation, a coalition of middle-class and working-class radicals under Hyndman&#8217;s leadership, working towards an independent labour party with a policy inspired by Marx. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane was involved in the beginning of this process, but soon turned to other activity. In March 1881 he was involved in the Freiheit Defence Committee, which was formed when Most was arrested for welcoming the assassination of the Tsar in <em>Die Freiheit</em>. As well as raising public support for press freedom and arranging a legal defence for Most (who got sixteen months&#8217; hard labour), the committee produced seven issues of an English <em>Freiheit</em> from April to June, edited by Kitz and published by the English section of the Social Democratic Club. At the same time Lane was involved in producing and distributing <em>The Radical</em>, a leftist weekly produced by Frank Soutter and Samuel Bennett from 1880 to 1882.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEarly in 1881, Lane moved to East London, where he spent the rest of his life. He first settled in Hackney, forming a new club, which was called the Socialistic Working Men&#8217;s Association in May, the Homerton Section of the Social Democratic Club in June, and the Homerton Social Democratic Club in July. Its original affiliation was with the Rose Street Club, which supplied it with some literature, but it soon became independent. From the start it was unequivocally socialist, and Lane practised the same politics as he preached. He acquired a printing press to produce his own literature, pasting up posters all over the area.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Homerton club held meetings on Sunday evenings at the Lamb and Flag in Homerton High Street, until they were closed down by the police at the beginning of 1882.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane was one of two delegates sent by the Homerton Social Democratic Club to the Anarchist International Congress in London in 1881. Private meetings were held at a public house in Charrington Street, Somers Town, during the third week in July; and a large public meeting was held at the Cleveland Town Hall on 18 July. Although the six English delegates were not anarchists, most of the forty foreign ones were, and Lane recalled that he met &#8220;Kropotkin, Malatesta, etc.&#8221; The Congress confirmed the policy of propaganda by deed, following the repression of socialist propaganda by any other method throughout Continental Europe, and tried to re-establish a socialist international. The English delegates were not reported to have said much in the proceedings. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Homerton Club was silenced, Lane widened his aim to cover the whole East End. He joined a group led by Kitz in organising open-air meetings at Mile End, agitating about housing conditions in the slums, intervening in various meetings and demonstrations with provocative leaflets and banners. They caused a sensation by bringing a banner defending tyrannicide to the Hyde Park mass assembly against Irish Coercion in July 1882. The sensation must have been sharpened by the fact that the banner was a quotation from <em>The Revolutionary Epick</em>, written in 1834 by other than Disraeli, the Conservative leader who had died in 1881. In 1882 Kitz and Lane joined Ambrose Barker and Tom Lemon of the Stratford Dialectical and Radical Club in forming the Labour Emancipation League, based at Mile End and Bethnal Green, which soon became the most important working-class organisation in the growing socialist movement. Its programme included six traditional radical points (adult suffrage and secret ballot; direct legislation by referendum; abolition of standing army; free secular education; freedom of speech, press and assembly; free administration of justice) and two definitely socialist ones (equalisation of wealth; socialisation of production). When the first secretary, Aaron Moseley, resigned Lane took over and established himself as the most effective socialist organiser in London. His old organisation was not completely superseded by the Labour Emancipation League. It continued to exist as the Homerton Socialist Club, and Lane was one of its two signatories to the <em>Manifesto to the Working Men of the World</em>, an unsuccessful appeal for the re-establishment of the International Working Men&#8217;s Association which was issued by the London socialist organisations in July 1883. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane never achieved much of a reputation as a writer or a speaker. Most of his writings were anonymous ephemera. In 1887 William Morris wrote that &#8220;his obvious earnestness and good faith make him a convincing speaker,&#8221; but the <em>Daily News</em> described him as &#8220;a humble sort of man&#8221; who &#8220;dropped his h&#8217;s recklessly.&#8221; His real gift was for the organisation of agitation and propaganda, and it was in 1882 that this really bore fruit. Lane later recalled:</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;This my mode of operations. Take a room, pay quarter&#8217;s rent in advance, then arrange list of lecturers for the three months, then get bills printed, one for each week, then each week paste up bills in streets all around. By the end of the three or six months I had got a few members and got them to take it over and manage it as a branch. I had generally two or three branches on my hands at once.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch branches quickly spread in East London, and the Labour Emancipation League extended its activities into Central and West London, bringing socialist ideas into the open at both indoor and outdoor meetings, and breaking into national politics. Meanwhile the coalition of the Democratic Federation had begun to break up. In 1882 it turned towards socialism, and in 1883 it adopted an openly socialist programme. In January 1884, it began publishing <em>Justice</em>, the first socialist weekly in Britain, and began working more and more closely with the Labour Emancipation League. Lane helped to distribute Justice, and agreed to arrange for delegates from the Labour Emancipation League to attend the annual conference of the Democratic Federation with a view to affiliation. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn August 1884, the Democratic Federation changed its name to the Social Democratic Federation, and adopted most of the programme and absorbed most of the leadership of the Labour Emancipation League. Lane was elected to the new Executive Council, and immediately joined the opposition to Hyndman&#8217;s authoritarian leadership, becoming a member of the caucus round Morris. The new coalition lasted only a few months, and by the end of the year the Social Democratic Federation split into an authoritarian minority led by Hyndman and an anti-authoritarian majority led by Morris. In December 1884, the majority seceded rather than expel the minority, and formed a new organisation called the Socialist League. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane signed both the statement explaining the split, <em>To Socialists</em>, and the <em>Manifesto of the Socialist League</em>, and he joined the Council of the new organisation. He brought with him most of the membership of the Labour Emancipation League, and also his printing press. He became the manager and joint publisher (with Morris) of the Socialist League paper, <em>The Commonweal</em>, and was also an occasional contributor from the first issue. He remained a leading figure in the Socialist League for four years, but he was often unhappy in it, resigning after personal differences temporarily from the Council in 1885 and permanently from the League itself in 1889.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Socialist League was itself yet another coalition, united at first mainly by hostility to Hyndman, and it soon developed parliamentarist and anti-parliamentarist fractions, &#8220;which are pretty commensurate with the Collectivists and Anarchists,&#8221; said Morris, who tried to hold the balance between them. At the first annual conference in July 1885, a draft parliamentarist constitution inspired by Engels was rejected, and abstinence from electoral activity was confirmed. (The Social Democratic Federation put up two candidates in the General Election of November 1885, paid for by Conservative money to split the Liberal vote. The Socialist League produced a leaflet, <em>For Whom Shall We Vote?</em>, concluding: &#8220;Do not vote at all!&#8221;) At the second annual conference in July 1886, the anti-parliamentarist policy was reaffirmed, but the parliamentarist fraction but factional fighting continued. Lane presented an anti-parliamentarist manifesto to the 1887 annual conference, but the Council decided not to print either of the &#8220;rival manifestoes,&#8221; as Morris called them, commenting privately that Lane&#8217;s was &#8220;a long lecture not at all fit for its purpose.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane therefore arranged to print his draft on his own responsibility. He got some support from Morris, who helped to pay for the printing, and also from Morris&#8217;s old friends Charles Faulkner and Philip Webb, and circularised the branches of the Socialist League. In the event the third annual conference in May 1887 rejected both manifestoes in favour of Morris&#8217;s &#8220;shelving resolution,&#8221; which repeated the original anti-parliamentarist policy and postponed the decision for another year. Lane published his manifesto in June, calling it <em>An Anti-Statist Communist Manifesto</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLane never returned to the socialist movement, but he kept in touch with some of his old comrades. He moved to Forest Gate, and during the decade before the First World War he produced occasional political leaflets. He died suddenly on 3 September 1920.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

From him we know that Lao Tzu was born in the state of Ch'u (presently eastern Honan Province). He writes about Lao Tzu's meeting with the philosopher Confucious (K'ung Fu-tzu) &mdash; two individuals who represented philosophies that would dominate Chinese culture and society for over 2,000 years. Ssu-ma Ch'ien explained:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\n\"When K'ung Fu-tzu went to Ch'u, he asked Lao Tzu to tutor him in the rites. Lao Tzu replied, \"The very bones of those you talk about have turned to dust. All that remains of them is their words. You know that when a noble lives in times which are good, he travels to court in a carriage. But when times are difficult, he goes where the wind blows. Some say that a wise mechant hides his wealth and thus seems poor. Likewise the sage, if he has great internal virtue, seems on the outside to be a fool. Stop being so arrogant &mdash; all these demands &mdash; your self-importance and your overkeen enthusiasm -- none of this is true to yourself. That is all I have to say to you.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote\">\r\nK'ung left and said to this followers, \"I know that a bird can fly; that fishes swim; that animals can run. Things that run can be trapped in nets. What can swim can be caught in traps. Those that fly can be shot down with arrows. But what to do with the dragon, I do not know. It rises on the clouds and the wind. Today I have met Lao Tzu, and he is like the dragon.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Ssu-ma Ch'ien later explains that Lao-tzu, having lived in Ch'u and practiced his philosophy for decades, left due to rampant corruption throughout the society. When he reached the border, the gatekeeper asked Lao Tzu to explain his philosophy, and this he reportedly did, in two sections with five thousand characters in a book called the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>. He was never again seen, and it would be some 300 years until Taoism became a major philosophical force throughout China.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Chelpanov was teaching psychology, and Leont'ev studied psychology with him. In 1924, Leont'ev graduated from what became the Faculty of Social Sciences. </p>\r\n<p>From 1924 to 1930 Leont'ev worked closely with Lev Vygotsky. In 1931, he was appointed to one of the psychological institutions in Kharkov, but his collaboration with <a href=\"../../people/v/y.htm#vygotsky-lev\">Vygotsky</a> continued. In 1950, Leont'ev became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of MGU. It was due to his hard work and efforts that this department became an independent Faculty in 1966. </p>\r\n<p>Leont'ev studied deliberate memory and attention and developed his own theory of activity which linked the social context to development. Leont'ev&#8217;s Activity Theory was the basis of much research in Russia, especially in the areas of play and learning.</p>\r\n<p>Alexei Leont'ev formulated the concept of activity as a systemic formation and unit of analysis for human sciences. Activity is a collective system driven by an object and motive. It is realized through individual actions driven by goals. Actions in turn are realized by means of routinized operations, dependent on the conditions of the action. To understand and facilitate development, we need to study and change entire collective activity systems, their objects and motives, not just isolated actions and skills. (<a href=\"http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/6.htm\">Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research</a>) </p>\r\n<p>Activity is always characterized by its object-orientation and it fulfils a specific purpose. The driving force for the activity is its motive: the motive is what drives the activity. As Leont'ev put it: &#8220;there can be no activity without a motive&#8221;. </p>\r\n<p>Action is the basic component of activity. Action is a means of realizing the activity and consequently satisfying the motive. The distinctive feature of an action is the fact that it is always goal oriented, it aims at satisfying a particular goal. </p>\r\n<p>The operational part of action refers to the specific circumstances surrounding its execution. Operations consitute the means by which an action is carried out. </p>\r\n<p>Leont'ev remained the Faculty Dean and the head of the Department of General Psychology until his death from a heart attack (<i>serdechno-sosudistoj nedostatochnosti</i>) in 1979. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/leontev/index.htm\">Leont'ev Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A\r\nlong time friend and sometimes attorney of <a href=\"../../people/l/u.htm#luxemburg-rosa\">Rosa Luxemburg</a>. After the murder of Lexemburg and Liebknecht, Levi put pressure on the authorities until the soldiers who murdered them were eventually convicted of the crime.</p>\r\n<p>Paul Levi was born on 11 March 1883 in Hechingen. As a barrister taking on political cases, he met, defended and came under the influence of Rosa Luxemburg. Levi proved his worth to the revolutionary workers&#8217; movement during the First World War, as Lenin pointed out in his defence in 1921. After Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches were murdered in 1919, he took the helm of the German Communist Party (KPD).</p>\r\n<p>Levi, however, soon developed differences with the leadership of the Communist International on various organisational and political issues, but his criticisms during the Second Congress of the Communist International were largely unpublished, supposedly because of a &#8216;paper shortage&#8217;. His differences came to a head over the KPD&#8217;s disastrous March Action of 1921. Having disagreed with the emissaries of the Communist International when he attended the Livorno congress of the Italian Communist Party, and resigned as the KPD&#8217;s Chairman in February 1921, he was out of the way in the lead-up to the March Action. Discussions of this affair at the Third Congress of the Communist International took place more in private than at plenary sessions, and thus the devastating criticisms of it by Lenin and Trotsky, fully concurring with Levi, are not apparent from the minutes and resolutions. Faces and reputations had to be saved, a split prevented, and a new orientation outlined. Diplomacy played a large part in the elaboration of a balance.</p>\r\n<p>Expelled from the KPD, Levi remained a Reichstag deputy until his death, representing the Social Democratic Party (SPD), whose left wing he led. He published the weekly <em>Sozialistische Politik und Wirtschaft</em>, which analysed and commentated on events. This later merged with <em>Klassenkampf</em>, the journal of the SPD&#8217;s Marxist left wing. This grouping was to form the SAP in 1931. Commenting on the tragic death of Levi, Arthur Rosenburg, in his classic study <em>Geschichte der Weimarer Republik</em> (Frankfurt am Main, 1961), described how he had &#8216;continually developed as a proletarian statesman&#8217;, and how, with his calls for &#8216;the Socialist workers to return to determined class struggle if they wished not merely to preserve their own existence but also the democratic republic... in the coming crisis, decisive sections of the German proletariat should have listened to Levi&#8217; (p196). Levi fell to his death on 9 February 1930. The circumstances were never clarified. He was still investigating, at considerable personal risk, the murders of Luxemburg and Liebknecht in an attempt to bring the killers to trial, and some have suggested that he was himself murdered. But the consensus is that his death was an accident. Only one month later, with the fall of the &#8216;Grand Coalition&#8217; led by Hermann Müller, the Weimar Republic effectively came to an end.</p>\r\n<p>Articles by Levi can be found in H Gruber (ed), <em>International Communism in the Era of Lenin</em> (New York, 1966 and 1972). These are &#8216;The Lessons of the Hungarian Revolution&#8217;, &#8216;The Munich Experience: An Opposing View&#8217;, &#8216;The Beginning of the Crisis in the Communist Party and the International&#8217;, and a large chunk of &#8216;Our Course Against Putschism&#8217;. The 1966 edition contains Gruber&#8217;s useful essay &#8216;Paul Levi and the Comintern&#8217;, which is omitted from the 1972 edition. Readers of German can refer to Charlotte Beradt&#8217;s biography <em>Paul Levi: Ein demokratischer Sozialist in der Weimar Republik</em> (EVA, Frankfurt am Main, 1969). Richard Lowenthal&#8217;s <em>The Bolshevisation of the Spartacus League</em> (St Anthony&#8217;s Papers, no 9, London, 1960) gives an in-depth treatment of the KPD and its relations with the Executive Committee of the Communist International. The recently published essay by the young Russian historian Alexander Vatlin, &#8216;\"Genosse Thomas&#8221; und die Geheimtätigkeit der Komintern in Deutschland 1919-1925&#8217;, in <em>Die Komintern 1919-1929</em> (Decaton, Mainz, 1993), draws upon the activities of the ECCI in Germany, and its conflicts with the KPD&#8217;s leadership in the early 1920s.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/levi-paul/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Paul Levi Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He was one of four children in a middle class Jewish family. They moved to Berlin when he was aged 15 and he was enrolled in the Gymnasium. In 1909 Kurt Lewin entered the University of Freiberg to study medicine. He then transferred to the University of Munich to study biology. Around this time he became in involved in the socialist movement. His particular concerns appear to have been the combating of anti-Semitism, the democratization of German institutions, and the need to improve the position of women. Along with other students he organized and taught an adult education program for working class women and men. </p>\r\n<p>While working for his doctorate at the University of Berlin he developed an interest in Gestalt psychology. He was wounded while serving in the German army. In 1921 he joined the Psychological Institute of the University of Berlin, where he lectured in philosophy and psychology. His work became known in America and he was invited to spend six months as a visiting professor at Stanford (1930). Lewin worked briefly with the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, but with the political position worsening in Germany, in 1933 he and his wife and daughter emigrated in the USA, where he became a citizen in 1940. Kurt Lewin was first to work at the Cornell School of Home Economics, and then, from 1935 to 1944, at the University of Iowa. </p>\r\n<p>At the University of Iowa he undertook research linked to the war effort including a study of troop morale, psychological warfare, and reorienting food consumption away from foods in short supply. At the same time he spoke frequently on minority and inter-group relations and worked with the American Jewish Congress in New York and was involved in studies of religious and racial prejudice. In 1944 he was a founder of the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. In 1946, working with community leaders and group facilitators he developed the idea of &#8216;T&#8217; groups or &#8216;basic skill training groups&#8217;. This theory was concerned with the process of group learning and collective decision-making. Lewin&#8217;s ideas drew from Gestalt psychology and parallels many of Dewey&#8217;s ideas about group learning.</p>\r\n<p>Lewin died of a heart attack in February 1947.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In 1917 he was elected vice president of the UMWA. Three years later he became president of what was then the largest trade union in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1921 Lewis, with the support of William Z.

In 1935 Lewis joined with the heads of seven other unions to form the Congress for Industrial Organisation (CIO). Lewis became president of this new organization and over the next few years attempted to organize workers in the new mass production industries. This strategy was successful and by 1937 the CIO had more members than the American Federation of Labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lewis had been a Republican but supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 and 1936 presidential campaigns. Although Lewis favoured many aspects of the New Deal, he was opposed to Roosevelt standing again in 1940. Lewis threatened to resign as president of the Congress for Industrial Organisation if Roosevelt was elected. He carried out this threat but retained his leadership of the United Mine Workers of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1940s Lewis led a series of strikes that resulted in increased wages for miners. This resulted a growth in union members to 500,000. Congress responded to the success of unions such as the UMWA by passing the Taft-Hartley Act (1947) that placed new restrictions on trade unions. Lewis held the post of president of the United Mine Workers of America until 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Llewellyn Lewis, who served as chairman of the UMWA's Welfare and Retirement Fund after his retirement, died in Washington on 11th June, 1969. </p>\r\n <p class=\"inline\">From <em>http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAlewisJL.htm</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n"

He joined the SDLP in exile and joined the editorial board of <em>Iskra</em>. </p>\n<p>\nLitvinov returned to Russia in 1903 and after the 1905 Revolution became editor of the SDLP's first legal newspaper, <em>Novaya Zhizn</em> (New Life). </p>\n<p>\nWhen the Russian government began arresting Bolsheviks in 1906, Litvinov left the country and spent the next ten years living in London where he was active in the International Socialist Bureau. </p>\n<p>\nAfter the October Revolution, Litvinov was appointed by Lenin as the Soviet Government's representative in Britain. However, in 1918, Litvinov was arrested by the British Government and held until exchanged for Bruce Lockhart, the British diplomat who had been imprisoned in Russia.</p>\n<p>\nLitvinov was then employed as the Soviet Government's roaming ambassador. It was largely through his efforts that Britain agreed to end its economic blockade of the Soviet Union. Litvinov also negotiated several trade agreements with European countries.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1930 Stalin appointed Litvinov as Commissar of Foreign Affairs. A firm believer in collective security, Litvinov worked very hard to form a closer relationships with France and Britain. In 1933 he successfully persuaded the United States to recognize the Soviet government.</p>\n<p>\nHis Jewish origins created problems for Stalin during his negotiations with Germany in 1939 and was replaced by Vyacheslav Molotov just before the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact.</p>\n<p>\nAfter the outbreak of war with Germany, Stalin appointed Litvinov as Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs. He also served as Ambassador to the United States (1941-43).

He became the most successful writer in America in the early 20th Century.

His years in the Klondike searching for gold left their mark in his best short stories; among them, <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, and <i>White Fang</i>. His best novel, <i>The Sea-Wolf</i>, was based on his experiences at sea. His work embraced the concepts of unconfined individualism and Darwinism in its exploration of the laws of nature. London was a socialist and supporter of the workers movement, but like many socialists of his time, especially in the &#8220;settler nations,&#8221; he was prone to racism and was a populist rather than a communist.

His ideas contributed to linking behavioural patterns to an evolutionary past, and known for his work on the roots of aggression. In the 1960s, along with Robert Ardrey and Desmond Morris, his animal stories were popularised to prove that human beings were basically animals and capitalist society no more than the expression of their animal nature.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe son of a surgeon, Lorenz showed an interest in animals at an early age, caring for sick animals from a nearby Zoo and keeping records of bird behaviour in a diary. He studied medicine for two semesters at Columbia University, before returning to study in Vienna, but all throughout, he maintained his detailed observations of animal behaviour. He was awarded a PhD in zoology in 1933. He established colonies of birds on his estate to facilitate his studies, and the observations he published soon gained him an international reputation. In 1935, he described <em>imprinting behaviour</em>, in which ducklings learn to follow their real or foster parents, Lorenz causing much amusement with the ducklings that had adopted him as their parents.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1936, Lorenz founded the German Society for Animal Psychology, and in 1937, he was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy and animal psychology at the University of Vienna.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom 1942 to 1944 he served as a physician in the German army and was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. He was returned to Austria in 1948 and headed the Institute of Comparative Ethology at Altenberg from 1949 to 1951. In 1950 he established a comparative ethology department in the Max Planck Institute. From 1961 to 1973 he served as director of the Max Planck Institute for Behaviour Physiology, in Seewiesen, and in 1973, together with Frisch and Tinbergen, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning animal behavioural patterns.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLorenz's work centred on the identification of behavioural patterns that are evolved and inherited by individuals of a species in the same way that anatomical features are inherited, and how specific drives are associated with each behavioural pattern and activate it in response to given stimuli or even <em>autonomously</em> (a cat <em>needs</em> to chase mice, even when it's not hungry). He also studied how animals respond when conflicting basic drives are activated, putting the animal in a kind of quandry, which makes the action of the drive and the associated behaviour particularly graphic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLorenz applied his ideas to the behaviour of humans, with controversial philosophical and sociological implications. In a popular book, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/lorenz.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">On Aggression</span></a> (1963), he argued that fighting and warlike behaviour in man are innate drives. While fighting in lower animals has a positive survival function, he observed, such as the dispersion of competitors and the maintenance of territory, war-like tendencies in humans needed to be ritualised into socially harmless or useful behaviour patterns (like sporting competitiveness). In another work, <span class=\"book\">Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge</span> (1973), Lorenz examined the nature of human thought and intelligence and attributed the problems of modern civilisation to the way in which basic drives were being frustrated or manifested in anti-social directions by the conditions of modern life.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nAdolph Lowe (born Adolf L&ouml;we) was for a long time the <em>eminence grise</em>  of the New School for Social Research founded in 1918 in New York. A veteran of World War I, Lowe helped plan the postwar demobilization of the German army, and served in the Socialization Committee which sought to nationalize the German economy. In 1922, Lowe joined the Ministry of Economics of the Weimar Republic. </p>\r\n<p>In 1926, Lowe joined the Kiel Institute of World Economics, a center dedicated to business cycle research whose other members included Fritz Burchardt, Gerhard Colm, Jacob Marschak and Hans Neisser. In 1926 he published a critique of the existing division between business cycle literature and equilibrium economic theory, and called for the development of a specialised theory of economic fluctuations. </p>\r\n<p>Drawing on Marx&#8217;s scheme of extended reproduction, Lowe found a new manner of conceiving motion in business cycle theory. Lowe&#8217;s concern with changing multisectoral structure over the cycle, as outlined in his 1926 essay, preceded and inspired a similar notion in the young Friedrich Hayek&#8217;s business cycle theory. Lowe&#8217;s own subsequent work, in particular the analysis of the &#8220;traverse&#8221; from one growth equilibrium to another (1952, 1954, 1976), has its roots in this paper. </p>\r\n<p>Lowe gravitated to the University of Frankfurt in 1931 where he came into fruitful contact with Horkheimer, Adorno and other members of the &#8220;Frankfurt School&#8221; &#8212; an influence that never left him. As a cosmopolitan, social democrat, ex-member of the German Socialization Committee and an architect of the Weimar Republic, Adolph Lowe&#8217;s position in Nazi-controlled Germany was quite untenable and he was one of the first to be removed. He left in 1933 to take up a position at the University of Manchester. Lowe left England in 1940, being perceived as an &#8220;enemy alien&#8221; &#8212; in spite of his naturalization and past history. His <em>Price of Liberty</em> (1936) outlines some of his impressions of Great Britain. </p>\r\n<p>During his stay at Frankfurt and Manchester, Lowe moved away from business cycle research he had pursued at Kiel and towards social philosophy and economic methodology. His famous 1935 <em>Economics and Sociology</em>, was a &#8220;plea for cooperation in the social sciences,&#8221; criticising notions of mechanistic rationality and the assumption of the constancy and uniformity of individual behavior. </p>\r\n<p>Lowe arrived at the New School for Social Research as the director of the &#8220;Institute of World Affairs&#8221; &#8212; that institution&#8217;s attempt to resurrect the old Kiel Institute. His indefatigable efforts in this regard led him to temporarily suspend his work on economic methodology and social structure. </p>\r\n<p>His 1951 article attacking the &#8220;mechanistic approach&#8221; to economics signalled his return to this field. His pre-war questions began to take a more definite form around this time &#8212; namely, in two issues which dominated the rest of his career, the &#8220;economic traverse&#8221; and &#8220;instrumental analysis&#8221;. Underlying both of these concepts was the recognition of changing and heterogeneous behavioral patterns &#8212; the crux of Lowe&#8217;s pre-war musings. If this is granted, then the approach of orthodox economic theory practically irrelevant as the object of study was continuously changing. As noted, the analysis of the &#8220;traverse&#8221;, already contained in his Kiel work, but only really formulated in the 1950s (e.g. 1952, 1954, 1955), addressed the issue of movements from a particular growth path to another and the detailing of the implied adjustment paths and the modifications in behavioral and economic structures which both engender and are implied by them. Thus, the dynamics behind the traverse, he envisioned to be related to socio-economic evolution which should not, indeed could not, be considered an exclusively economic phenomenon. He continued developing his ideas on the relationship between evolution and growth, in particular, outlining the role of changing behavior and multiple behavior patterns on the resulting economic process. His position is perhaps best outlined in his masterful and inspiring <em>On Economic Knowledge</em> (1965). </p>\r\n<p>Lowe &#8220;retired&#8221; in 1963, remaining at the New School as a lecturer, until he returned to Germany in 1983. Lowe died at the age of 102. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nLowenthal was born in Frankfurt in 1900, the son of assimilated Jews (his father was a physician), and he came of age during the turbulent early years of the Weimar Republic. He jointed the newly founded Institute in 1926 and quickly became its leading expert on the sociology of literature and mass culture as well as the managing editor of the journal it launched in 1932, the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung. Heterodox and independent Marxists, open to new intellectual currents such as psychoanalysis, and predominantly Jewish, the Institute&#8217;s members swiftly fled Germany when Hitler came to power in 1933. After a year in Geneva, they settled in New York, where Columbia University gave them shelter. Lowenthal maintained a close relationship with his colleagues, even during the war when several of them moved to California and he began to work with the Office of War Information in Washington. Although Horkheimer, Adorno, and Friedrich Pollock returned to Frankfurt to reestablish the Institute after the war, Lowenthal, like former members Herbert Marcuse, Franz Neumann, Otto Kirchheimer, and Erich Fromm, chose to remain in the United States. After seven years as research director of the Voice of America, and another seven years at the Stanford Center for the Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences, he joined the Berkeley Speech Department in 1956 and shortly thereafter the Department of Sociology. Although officially retiring in 1968, Lowenthal remained vigorously active in departmental and University affairs until virtually the end of his life. From 1968 to 1972, he served on the Budget Committee, and in 1973-74, chaired the Sociology Department.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe celebrated private seminar he conducted with graduate students interested in the sociology of literature was launched during the student strike of 1970 and continued to meet through the last months of 1992. As two of its participants, Jim Stockinger and Terry Strathman, remember it, the seminar produced a remarkable &#8220;cross-generational dialogue,&#8221; whose focus on literature &#8220;was particularly liberating&#8221; for sociologists unaccustomed to literary analysis. &#8220;Good wine, cheese, hearty and spirited debate and a large dose of German conviviality,&#8221; they recalled, &#8220;made these evenings unforgettable experiences.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLowenthal's publications were collected during the 1980s, both in German, by the Suhrkamp Verlag, and in English, by Transaction Press. Most notable among them were <em>Prophets of Deceit</em> (written with Norbert Guterman in 1949), <em>Literature and the Image of Man</em> (1957) and <em>Literature, Popular Culture, and Society</em> (1961). Also included were his early writings on Jewish themes and his last ruminations on postmodernism, against whose dangers he warned. His autobiographical reflections, including fascinating conversations with the German sociologist Helmut Dubiel, were published by the University of California as <em>An Unmastered Past</em> in 1987. The extensive interviews he gave in 1989 to another German interlocutor, Frithjof Hager, dealt with postmodernism and other contemporary themes; they stimulated a collection of responses by European and American scholars published in honor of his ninetieth birthday as <em>Geschichte Denken: Ein Notizbuch für Leo Lowenthal</em> by the Reclam Verlag of Leipzig. For his eightieth, he had been the recipient of a Festschrift of celebratory essays in the journal <em>Telos</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the last decade of his life, Lowenthal was richly honored on both sides of the Atlantic. Awarded the Berkeley Citation and the Federal Republic of Germany's Distinguished Merit Cross in 1985, he also received honorary doctorates from the University of Siegen, the Free University of Berlin, and the University of Hamburg. Further, he was given the city of Frankfurt&#8217;s Goethe Medal and Adorno Prize, as well as a year at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. In 1985, the first full-length appreciation of his work was published by Michael Kausch as <em>Erziehung und Unterhaltung: Leo Lowenthals Theorie der Massenkommunikation</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the final survivor of the Frankfurt School&#8217;s inner circle, he achieved international recognition as a symbol of its remarkable collective achievement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLowenthal&#8217;s training in collaborative scholarship and his broad humanistic learning allowed him to play a leading role both in the institutional and intellectual life of the campus as a whole. An early supporter of the Free Speech Movement, but troubled by the excesses that followed, he was a leading member of the faculty committee chaired by Charles Muscatine that produced the widely admired report published as Education at Berkeley.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLowenthal displayed an extraordinary ability to maintain close friendships with scholars in disparate fields and begin new ones with members of very different generations. He remained a vital presence long after his active teaching days were over. His quick, often acerbic wit, uncanny shrewdness in judging &#8211; and gleefully gossiping about &#8211; people, and manifest zest for living life fully never deserted him. Nor did his intransigent refusal to abandon the long-cherished ideals of his youth, even as he soberly acknowledged the improbability of their ever being realized. Ruthlessly unsentimental and impatient with cant of any kind, he nonetheless refused to succumb to the sour cynicism of those who turn into the deadly adults Horkheimer and Adorno warned against.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://dynaweb.oac.cdlib.org:8088/dynaweb/uchist/public/inmemoriam/inmemoriam1993/@Generic__BookTextView/1841\" target=\"_top\">In Memoriam for Lowenthal</a>.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/lowenthal/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Leo Lowenthal Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../l.htm\">Index of the Letter L</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n"

His major contributions include the formulation of a Marxist system of aesthetics that opposed political control of artists and defended humanism and an elaboration of Marx's theory of alienation within industrial society. His <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm\" target=\"_top\">What is Orthodox Marxism?</a></span> and <span class=\"book\">The Changing Function of Historical Materialism</span>, demonstrated his creative and independent approach to Marxist theory.</p>\n\n<p>\nBorn into a wealthy Jewish family, Luk&aacute;cs had read Marx while at school, but was more influenced by <a href=\"../../people/k/i.htm#kierkegaard-soren\">Kierkegaard</a> and <a href=\"../../people/w/e.htm#weber-max\">Weber</a>.

In the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, Luk&aacute;cs joined the Hungarian Communist Party in 1918. After the overthrow of <a href=\"../../people/k/u.htm#kun-bela\">B&eacute;la Kun</a>'s short-lived Hungarian Communist regime in 1919, in which Luk&aacute;cs served as Commissar for Culture and Education, the Hungarian white terror brutally persecuted former government members.</p>\n\n<p>\nFleeing the White Terror, Lukacs moved to Vienna, where he remained for 10 years. He edited the review <em>Kommunismus</em>, which for a time became a focal point for the ultra-left currents in the Third International and and was a member of the Hungarian underground movement. In his book <a href=\"../../../archive/lukacs/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">History and Class Consciousness</span></a> (1923), he developed these ideas and laid the basis for his critical literary tenets by linking the development of form in art with the history of the class struggle. He came under sharp criticism from the Comintern, and facing expulsion from the Party and consequent exclusion from the struggle against fascism, he recanted. </p>\n\n<p>\nLuk&aacute;cs was in Berlin from 1929 to 1933, save for a short period in 1930-31, at which time he attended the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow. In 1933 he left Berlin and returned to Moscow to attend the Institute of Philosophy. He moved back to Hungary in 1945 and became a member of parliament and a professor of aesthetics and the philosophy of culture at the University of Budapest. In 1956 he was a major figure in the Hungarian uprising, serving as minister of culture during the revolt. He was arrested and deported to Romania but was allowed to return to Budapest in 1957, where, stripped of his former power and status, he devoted himself to a steady output of critical and philosophical works.  </p>\n\n<p>\nIn later years, Luk&aacute;cs repudiated many of the positions put in his early works which had formed the starting point for such writers as <a href=\"../../people/a/d.htm#adorno-theodor\">Adorno</a> and <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#fromm-erich\">Fromm</a>, and other tendencies which not only rejected the Stalinised version of Marxism, but departed from Marx's central principles.

He was educated at a missionary school and worked in Leopoldville (Kinshasa) and Stanleyville (Kisangani) as a clerk and journalist. In 1955 Lumumba became regional president of a Congolese trade union and joined the Belgian Liberal Party. He was arrested in 1957 on charges of embezzlement and imprisoned for a year. On his release he helped found the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) in 1958. In 1959 Belgium announced a five year path to independence and in the December local elections the MNC won a convincing majority despite Lumumba being under arrest at the time. A 1960 conference in Belgium agreed to bring independence forward to June 1960 with elections in May. Lumumba and the MNC formed the first government on June 23, 1960, with Lumumba as Prime Minister and Joseph Kasavubu as President. </p> \n<p>\nHis rule was marked by the political disruption when the province of Katanga declared independence under Moise Tshombe in June 1960 with Belgian support. Despite the arrival of United Nations troops unrest continued and Lumumba sought Soviet aid. In September Lumumba was dismissed from government by Kasavubu, an act of dubious legality. On September 14 a coup d'etat headed by Colonel Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko) and supported by Kasavubu gained power. Lumumba was arrested on December 1, 1960 by troops of Mobutu. He was captured in Port Francqui and flown to Leopoldville in handcuffs. Mobutu said Lumumba would be tried for inciting the army to rebellion and other crimes. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold made an appeal to Kasavubu asking that Lumumba be treated according to due process of law. The USSR denounced Hammarskjold and the Western Powers as responsible for Lumumba's arrest and demanded his release. </p> \n<p>\nThe United Nations Security Council was called into session on December 7 to consider Soviet demands that the U.N. seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo. Soviet Representative Valerian Zorin refused U.S. demands that he disqualify himself as Security Council President during the debate. Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, answering Soviet attacks against his Congo operations, said that if the U.N. force were withdrawn from the Congo &#8220;I fear everything will crumble.&#8221; </p> \n<p>\nFollowing a U.N. report that Lumumba had been mistreated by his captors, his followers threated (on December 9) to arrest all Belgians and &#8220;start cutting off the heads of some of them&#8221; unless Lumumba was released within 48 hours. </p> \n<p>\nThe threat to the U.N. cause was intensified by the announcement of the withdrawal of their U.N. Congo contingents by Yugoslavia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Indonesia, Morocco, and Guinea. The Soviet pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on December 14 by a vote of 8-2. On the same day, a Western resolution that would have given Hammarskjold increased powers to deal with the Congo situation was vetoed by the Soviet Union. </p> \n<p>\nLumumba was then transported on January 17, 1961 from the military prison in Thysville near Leopoldville to a &#8220;more secure&#8221; prison in Jadotville in the Katanga Province. There were reports that Lumumba and his fellow prisoners, Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, were beaten by provincial police upon their arrival in secessionist Katanga. </p> \n<p>\nTwo months later, Lumumba was executed along with his two aides. </p> \n<p>\nIn February of 2002, the Belgian government admitted to &#8220;an irrefutable portion of responsibility in the events that led to the death of Lumumba.&#8221; </p> \n<p>\nIn July of 2002 documents released by the United States government revealed that the CIA had played a role in Lumumba's assassination, aiding his opponents with money and political support, and in the case of Mobutu with weapons and military training.

In 1889, at 18 years old, Luxemburg's revolutionary agitation forced her to move to Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland, to escape imprisonment. While in Z&uuml;rich, Luxemburg continued her revolutionary activities from abroad,  while studying political economy and law; receiving her doctorate in 1898. She met with many <a href=\"../../orgs/r/u.htm#rsdlp\">Russian Social Democrats</a> (at a time before the R.S.D.L.P. split); among them the leading members of the party: <a href=\"../../people/p/l.htm#plekhanov\">Georgy Plekhanov</a> and <a href=\"../../people/a/x.htm#axelrod-pavel\">Pavel Axelrod</a>. It was not long before Luxemburg voiced sharp theoretical differences with the Russian party, primarily over the issue of Polish self-determination: Luxemburg believed that self-determination weakened the international Socialist movement, and helped only the bourgeoisie to strengthen their rule over  newly independent nations. Luxemburg split with both the Russian and Polish Socialist Party over this issue, who believed in the rights of Russian national minorities to self-determination. In opposition, Luxemburg helped create the Polish Social Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>\nDuring this time Luxemburg met her life-long companion Leo Jogiches, who was head of the Polish Socialist Party. While Luxemburg was the speaker and theoretician of the party, Jogiches complimented her as the organiser of the party. The two developed an intense personal and political relationship throughout the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>\nLuxemburg left Z&uuml;rich for Berlin in 1898, and joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/g/e.htm#gsdlp\">German Social Democractic Labour Party</a>. Quickly after joining the party, Luxemburg's most vibrant revolutionary agitation and writings began to form. Expressing the central issues of debate in the German Social Democracy at the time, she wrote <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Reform or Revolution</a> in 1900; against Eduard Bernstein's revisionism of Marxist theory. Luxemburg explained:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n \"His theory tends to counsel us to renounce the social transformation, the final goal of Social-Democracy and, inversely, to make of social reforms, the means of the class struggle, its aim. Bernstein himself has very clearly and characteristically formulated this viewpoint when he wrote: \"The Final goal, no matter what it is, is nothing; the movement is everything.\" </p> \n<p>\nWhile Luxemburg supported reformist activity (as the <em>means</em> of class struggle), the aim of these reforms was a complete revolution. She stressed that endless reforms would continually support the ruling bourgeois, long past the time a proletarian revolution could have begun to build a Socialist society. Luxemburg, along with <a href=\"../../people/k/a.htm#kautsky\">Karl Kautsky</a>, helped to prevent this revisionism of Marxist theory in the German Socialist party. (Further Reading: <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1904/06/05.htm\" target=\"_top\">1904: Social Democracy and Parliamentarism</a>)</p>\n<p>\nBy the 1905 Revolution in Russia, Luxemburg refocused her attention to the Socialist movement in the Russian Empire, explaining the great movement the Russian proletariat had begun:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n \"For on this day the Russian proletariat burst on the political stage as a class for the first time; for the first time the only power which historically is qualified and able to cast Tsarism into the dustbin and to raise the banner of civilization in Russia and everywhere has appeared on the scene of action.\"</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">\n<a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1905/02/08.htm\" target=\"_top\">Revolution in Russia</a></p>\n<p>\nLuxemburg stood by the Marxist theory of the Russian proletariat leading a Socialist revolution; in opposition to the Russian <a href=\"../../orgs/m/e.htm#menshevik\">Menshevik</a> and <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#srs\">Socialist-Revolutionary</a> parties, but in support of the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolshevik\">Bolshevik</a> party. Luxemburg moved to Warsaw to aid the Russian revolutionary uprising, and was imprisoned for her activities.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1906, Luxemburg began to strongly advocate her theory of <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1906/mass-strike/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Mass Strike</a> as the most important revolutionary weapon of the proletariat. This continual drive became a major point of contention in the German Social Democratic party, primarily opposed by <a href=\"../../people/b/e.htm#bebel\">August Bebel</a> and Karl Kautsky. For such passionate and relentless agitation, Luxemburg earned the nickname \"Bloody Rosa.\"</p>\n<p>\nBefore the first World War, Luxemburg wrote <em>The Accumulation of Capital</em> in 1913; a work explaining the capitalist movement towards imperialism. With the begining of World War I, Luxemburg stood ardently against the German Social-Democratic Parties' social-chauvinistic stand; supporting German aggression and annexations of other nations. Allied with <a href=\"../../people/l/i.htm#liebknecht-karl\">Karl Liebknecht</a>, Luxemburg left the Social Democractic party, and helped form the <a href=\"../../orgs/i/n.htm#internationale-group\">Internationale Group</a>, which soon became the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/p.htm#spartacus-league\">Spartacus League</a>, in opposition of Socialist national chauvinism, agitating instead that German soldiers turn their weapons against their own government and overthrow it. </p>\n<p>\nFor this revolutionary agitation, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were arrested and imprisoned. While in prison, Luxemburg wrote the <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Junius Pamphlet</a>, which became the theoretical foundation of the Spartacus League. Also while in prison, Luxemburg wrote on the Russian Revolution, most famously in her book: <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Russian Revolution</a>, where she warns of the dictatorial powers of the Bolshevik party. Here Luxemburg explains her views on the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n \"Yes, dictatorship! But this dictatorship consists in the <em>manner of applying democracy,</em> not in its <em>elimination,</em> but in energetic, resolute attacks upon the well-entrenched rights and economic relationships of bourgeois society, without which a socialist transformation cannot be accomplished. But this dictatorship must be the work of the <em>class</em> and not of a little leading minority in the name of the class -- that is, it must proceed step by step out of the active participation of the masses; it must be under their direct influence, subjected to the control of complete public activity; it must arise out of the growing political training of the mass of the people.</p>\n<p>\nWhile Luxemburg attacked the Soviet government being dominated by the strong hand of the Bolshevik party, she recognised the Civil War that was raging through Russia and the present need for such a government:</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n \"It would be demanding something superhuman from Lenin and his comrades if we should expect of them that under such circumstances they should conjure forth the finest democracy, the most exemplary dictatorship of the proletariat and a flourishing socialist economy. By their determined revolutionary stand, their exemplary strength in action, and their unbreakable loyalty to international socialism, they have contributed whatever could possibly be contributed under such devilishly hard conditions. The danger begins only when they make a virtue of necessity and want to freeze into a complete theoretical system all the tactics forced upon them by these fatal circumstances, and want to recommend them to the international proletariat as a model of socialist tactics.\" </p>\n<p>\nLuxemburg later opposed the newly formed Soviet government's efforts to come to Peace on all fronts, by signing the <a href=\"../../events/b/r.htm#brest-litovsk-treaty\">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> with Germany. (Further reading: <a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/1918/09/11.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Russian Tragedy</a>)</p>\n<p>\nIn November, 1918, the German government reluctantly released Luxemburg from prision, whereupon she immediately began again revolutionary agitation. A month later, Luxemburg and Liebknecht founded the German Communist Party, while armed conflicts were raging in the streets of Berlin in support of the Spartacus League.</p>\n<p>\nOn January 15, 1919, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, and Wilhelm Pieck; the leaders of the German Communist Party, were arrested and taken in for questioning at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin. While what happened is not known, save for the last sentence, one account is that they were told they were to be relocated; German soldiers escorted Luxemburg and Liebknecht out of the building, knocking them unconscious as they left. Pieck managed to escape, while the unconscious bodies of Luxemburg and Liebknecht were quietly driven away in a German military jeep. They were shot, and thrown into a river. </p>\n<p>\nWith the finest leaders of the German Communist movement murdered, the gates of rising German facism opened unhindered.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <strong><a href=\"../../../archive/luxemburg/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Rosa Luxemburg Internet Archive</a></strong></p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Off-site link:</em> <a href=\"http://revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv5n1/luxembrg.htm\">&#8216;If You Do Not Follow the Order You Will Be Shot&#8217;:  New facts about the murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg</a></p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n"

        "content": "\nLu Xun (Lu Hsun) was the pen name of Zhou Shuren. Lu is widely regarded as one of modern China&#8217;s most prominent and influential writers. His work frequently promoted radical change through criticism of antiquated cultural values and repressive social customs.</p>\n<p>Zhou was born into a poor family. His father was unable to provide for the family and he died during Zhou&#8217;s teenage years. Zhou&#8217;s mother was well-educated and she encouraged in his studies. Zhou demonstrated a keen intellect early in life. He studied at the Jiangnan Naval Academy, the School of Railways and Mines in Nanjing and the Medical College at Sendai in Japan. During the course of his studies, he became acquainted with social movements aimed at reforming and reshaping Chinese society.</p>\n<p>During the course of Zhou&#8217;s political and intellectual development, he concluded that a &#8220;literary movement&#8221; was needed to build awareness and incite action amongst the oppressed. As early as 1906, he decided to publish a literary magazine, but his early attempts at organizing such an endeavor were unsuccessful. In 1908, he joined the anti-Qing revolutionary party, Guang Fu Hui, and he remained involved with this group up to the Revolution of 1911 which resulted in the removal of the Qing Dynasty. Zhou was ultimately disenchanted with the results of the Revolution, for although the Qing Dynasty was unseated, the people of China languished amidst imperialist intervention and oppressive semi-colonial conditions.</p>\n<p>Zhou Shuren struggled with uncertainty as to how he could best utilize his political awareness while he immersed himself in the study of Chinese culture. He adopted the pen name of &#8220;Lu Xun,&#8221; partially in tribute to his mother, whose surname was Lu. With some encouragement from peers, Lu ultimately wrote and published his first story, &#8220;A Madman&#8217;s Diary,&#8221; in 1918. The story was published in the May Fourth movement&#8217;s magazine &#8220;New Youth&#8221; Lu&#8217;s work was well received and he followed up with a number of other short stories, including his celebrated tale of the Revolution of 1911, &#8220;The True Story of Ah-Q.&#8221; In 1923, Lu published &#8220;A Call to Arms,&#8221; which was an anthology of his most acclaimed works.</p>\n<p>Lu Xun quickly gained notoriety as a stirring, insightful, and prolific writer. In addition to writing, Lu worked as an editor, professor and dean of studies. Lu began studying Marxism-Leninism in 1928 and shortly thereafter, he undertook the translation of works concerning Marxist literary theory. Although Lu never joined the Chinese Communist Party, he was widely regarded as a Marxist in the later years of his life and he worked closely with communists in many anti-imperialist and anti-fascist campaigns. Lu advocated a united front by the CCP and the Kuomintang against the forces of Japanese imperialism. While afflicted with tuberculosis, Lu continued to write passionately about the struggle against Japanese aggression until his death in 1936.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <strong><a href=\"../../../archive/lu-xun/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Lu Xun Archive</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../l.htm\">Index of the Letter L</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

        "content": "\r\nErnest Mandel joined the Belgian affiliate of the Fourth International (FI, founded by Trotsky in 1938) when he was seventeen and has been a member of the Central Committee of this organization since 1941. He was active in the anti-Nazi resistance and was arrested and sent to a German prison camp in 1944. The Second World Congress of the FI, held after the war, elected him to a leadership position, which he has since maintained. During the 1950s and 1960s, when the Trotskyists operated within the Belgian Socialist Party, Mandel worked in the Economic Studies Commission of the Belgian Trade Union Federation, writing a report on economic concentration. He was expelled from the Socialist Party for opposing its coalition with the Christian Socialists and its acceptance of antistrike legislation. Mandel has been barred at various times from entering the United States, France, Switzerland, and Germany, where he nonetheless earned a doctorate in political economy at the Free University of Berlin. In 1978 he delivered the Alfred Marshall Lectures at Cambridge University.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to his prolific activity as an editor and writer for the Trotskyist and other leftist press, Mandel has published several volumes of political essays. By and large he has remained faithful to classic Trotskyist politics, calling (in Europe at least) for a united front of the FI with the Socialist and Communist parties in the formation of a &#8220;bourgeois workers&#8217; government,&#8221; with an eye to its eventual replacement, once the revolutionary insufficiency of the latter parties is seen by the masses, by a government of &#8220;transition to socialism&#8221; by the FI alone. The socialism to be established is conceived of as a matter of a nationalized economy with workers&#8217; control operating to the &#8220;technologically feasible&#8221; extent. In this the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia has shown the way, although the Stalinist-bureaucratic distortions of the socialism established by Lenin and Trotsky may require a political revolution to establish a workers&#8217; government answering to the socialist economy already in place.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOutside of Trotskyist circles, Mandel&#8217;s main impact has been as an economic writer. He is the author of books on the economic competition between Europe and America and on capitalism&#8217;s recent difficulties: his little Introduction to Marxist Economics is said to have sold several hundred thousand copies. His main contributions have been the two-volume Marxist Economic Theory (1962) and the massive Late Capitalism (1975). The former aims to show that it is possible, on the basis of the scientific data of contemporary science, to reconstitute the whole economic system of Karl Marx. It thus consists, on the one hand, of the compilation of an enormous mass of data and descriptive material bearing on the nature and history of capitalism and, on the other, of an attempt to integrate parts of bourgeois economics along with elements of the many conflicting Marxist schools into one comprehensive theory. The book includes a consideration of the Soviet economy as exemplifying the &#8220;transition to socialism,&#8221; marred though it is by Stalinist distortions. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLate Capitalism more particularly strives to explain the contemporary history of capitalism by its immanent laws of motion. &#8220;Late capitalism&#8221; is seen as characterized by the dominance of the multinational firm and by the involvement of the state in the national and international economy. Despite these modifications, however, capitalism remains under the sway of the crisis tendency diagnosed by Marx. As in the earlier book, Mandel&#8217;s explanation of this tendency involves the combination of a number of seemingly incompatible theories in a &#8220;multifaceted&#8221; approach, although at base Mandel follows Roman Rosdolsky in holding to a form of underconsumption theory. A novelty is Mandel&#8217;s attempt to integrate his eclectic conception into a version of the Kondratiev &#8216;long wave&#8217; theory of fifty-year cycles of upturns and downturns: this is used, finally, to explain both the long period of prosperity capitalism enjoyed after the last world was and its recent economic misfortunes. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom: <em>Biographical Dictionary of the American Left</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n"

He fled to Geneva in 1933 when Hitler came to power, then went to the United States in 1934, where he taught at Columbia University and became a US citizen in 1940. His <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/marcuse/works/reason/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Reason &amp; Revolution</span></a>, written in 1941, made an important contribution to the understanding of Hegel and his influence on Marx.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army during World War II, he headed the Central European Section of the Office of Intelligence Research after the war.

Marcuse observed that Post-War prosperity had managed to keep the masses intellectually and spiritually captive and his later works are permeated with pessimism. Although a open critic of the established order, Marcuse did not applaud the 1968 demonstrations by students, many of whom were his readers, believing the demonstrations to be misguided: &#8220;I still consider the American University an oasis of free speech and real critical thinking in the society,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Any student movement should try to protect this citadel . . .

        "content": "\r\nThe United States Socialist Party platform of 1916 called for the tactics of mass action and general strike as a means to prevent the impending war. A strong advocate of this approach, Mary Marcy, then a member of the SP's left-wing and editor of the <span class=\"book\"><em>International Socialist Review,</em></span> authored of a series of articles in that journal explaining how if workers united and shut down the mines, factories, and transportation, it would be workers, not the ruling class, that would have control of the military and of economic power. This is a position Marcy and the <em>ISR</em> would fearlessly maintain throughout the war years. Marcy also stressed that it is relatively easy for the ruling class to suppress such a revolt by getting rid of the leaders. But when mass action is independent of leaders? It is nearly impossible to stop a rank-and-file revolutionary movement. In her preface to <span class=\"book\"><em>The Life of Eugene Debs</em>,</span> she wrote, \"Men do not wage the great class struggle in the study, nor in the editorial rooms....The workers are the fighters and the thinkers of the revolutionary movements.\" Marcy and others in the left wing of the SP supported reforms such as shorter hours and higher wages, but only in order to educate workers in the class struggle.\r\n</p><p>It is not hard to understand how Mary Marcy came to be an outspoken, influential and respected revolutionary writer. Born in 1877 in Belleville, Illinois, Mary Tobias was orphaned as a child. She went to work as a teenager and a few years later taught herself stenography skills while raising her two younger siblings. She learned the consequences of being a political radical early when she was fired for wearing a William Jennings Bryan button to work in 1896--something forbidden by her employer, a maker of American flags. An impressed Clarence Darrow, learning of her dismissal, secured her a job at the University of Chicago where she got the perk of taking tuition-free classes. She studied there, among other things, psychology under John Dewey. In 1901 soon after she married Leslie Marcy, they moved to Kansas City where she took work in a packing firm. Two years later, they joined the SP. Apparently never holding a party office, her role was to educate and motivate workers as well as criticize the SP&#8217;s reformist right wing through her writings.\r\n</p><p>In 1904, Mary Marcy&#8217;s first series of essays were run in the <em>International Socialist Review.</em> The <em>ISR</em> was published by the Marcy&#8217;s good friend, Charles Kerr, from 1900 to 1918, when government repression caused it to fold. It was the only socialist paper to support the left wing of the SP as well as the IWW, a position reflected in Marcy's work. One of the early pieces published was Marcy&#8217;s was the serialized Marcy classic proletarian fictional work, <span class=\"book\"><em>Out of the Dump.</em></span> This was a strong attack on the \"scientific\" charity movement, again drawn on Marcy&#8217;s own work experience with Associated Charities.\r\n</p><p>Marcy dedicated herself to writing for workers in everyday language. She broke down economics into understandable parts with a series on Marxist economics in the <em>ISR</em> which later became the booklet <a href=\"../../../subject/women/authors/marcy/shop/index.htm\"><span class=\"book\">Shop Talks On Economics,</span></a> which was translated into many languages. She wrote stories for children in order to introduce them to historical materialism. She also reported on the major strikes of the day, technology in industry, farm and agricultural issues, elections, international policy, verse for a deck of Socialist playing cards, poetry, and a satirical play on free love.\r\n</p><p>Marcy&#8217;s focus in the last few years at the <em>ISR</em> was primarily analysis on the crisis surrounding the war. Marcy's writings on the women&#8217;s question are controversial. Clearly she put class struggle as primary, but neither did she think women were in any way intellectually inferior to men; encouraging them to join unions and the Socialist Party. Unfortunately a fuller explanation of Marcy&#8217;s thoughts and writings may never be known since she left no personal papers and much of what she had in personal records was taken during a Department of Justice raid on her home in 1919. By this time the <em>ISR</em> had ceased publication and she had left the SP to join the IWW. Marcy continued writing articles and letters to her correspondents around the world and worked in support of her comrades that were in prison or enduring government harassment.\r\n</p><p>When \"Big Bill\"  Haywood jumped bail and left for Russia in 1921, the Marcy&#8217;s lost their home which was put up for collateral. Worn down, disillusioned, and her health in decline, she committed suicide in 1922.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/marcy-m/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Mary Marcy Archive</a></p> \r\n\r\n\r\n"

His family was Jewish, but converted to Protestanism in 1824. The family was <a href=\"../../terms/p/e.htm#petty-bourgeois\">petty-bourgeois</a>; his father was a lawyer. After graduating from a Gymnasium (High School) in Trier, Marx entered the university, first\r\nat Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoring\r\nin history and philosophy. He concluded his\r\nuniversity course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesis\r\non the philosophy of Epicurus. At the time Marx was a\r\nHegelian <a href=\"../../terms/i/d.htm#idealist\">idealist</a> in his views. In Berlin, he belonged to\r\nthe circle of \"<a href=\"../../orgs/y/o.htm#young-hegelians\">Left Hegelians</a>\" (with <a href=\"../b/a.htm#bauer-bruno\">Bruno Bauer</a> and\r\nothers) who sought to draw atheistic and\r\nrevolutionary conclusions from Hegel&#8217;s philosophy. <a href=\"../f/e.htm#feuerbach-ludwig\">Ludwig Feuerbach</a> began to\r\ncriticize theology, particularly after 1836, and he began his\r\nturn to <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism\">materialism</a>, which in 1841 gained\r\nascendancy in his philosophy (<em>The Essence of Christianity</em>). \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter graduating from university, Marx moved to Bonn,\r\nhoping to become a professor. However, the\r\n<a href=\"../../terms/r/e.htm#reactionary\">reactionary</a> policy of the government made Marx\r\nabandon the idea of an academic career, after\r\nLudwig Feuerbach had been deprived of his chair in 1832 (and\r\nwho was not allowed to return to the university\r\nin 1836); and in 1841 the government had forbade the young Professor\r\nBruno Bauer to lecture at Bonn.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the begining on 1842, some <a href=\"../../terms/r/e.htm#revolutionary\">radical</a> bourgeois in the Rhineland (Cologne), who were in touch with the Left Hegelians, founded a paper in opposition to the Prussian government, called the <a href=\"../../periodicals/r/h.htm#rz\">Rheinische Zeitung</a>. Marx and Bruno Bauer were invited to be the chief contributors, and in October 1842 Marx became editor-in-chief and moved from Bonn to Cologne. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe newspaper&#8217;s revolutionary-democratic trend became more and more pronounced under Marx&#8217;s editorship, and the government first imposed double and triple censorship on the paper, and then on January 1 1843 suppressed it. Marx was forced to resign the editorship before that date, but his resignation did not save the paper, which suspended publication in March 1843. Of the major articles Marx contributed to Rheinische Zeitung, Engels notes, an article on the condition of peasant winegrowers in the Moselle Valley. Marx&#8217;s journalistic activities convinced him that he was insufficiently acquainted with political economy, and he zealously set out to study it. (See: <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/subject/newspapers/rheinische-zeitung.htm\" target=\"_top\">Marx&#8217;s articles for the Rheinische Zeitung</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1843, Marx married, at Kreuznach, a childhood friend he had become engaged to while still a student. His wife came from a bourgeois family of the Prussian nobility, her elder brother being Prussia&#8217;s Minister of the Interior during an extremely reactionary period &#8211; 1850-58.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the autumn of 1843, Marx went to Paris in order to publish a radical journal abroad, together with <a href=\"../r/u.htm#ruge\">Arnold Ruge</a> (1802-1880). Only one issue of this journal, <a href=\"../../periodicals/d/e.htm#dfj\">Deutsch-Franz&ouml;sische Jahrb&uuml;cher</a>, appeared. Publication was discontinued owing to the difficulty of secretly distributing it in Germany, and to disagreement with Ruge. Marx&#8217;s articles in this journal showed that he was already a revolutionary who advocated \"merciless criticism of everything existing\", and in particular the \"criticism by weapon\", and appealed to the masses and to the proletariat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlso in 1843, Feuerbach wrote his famous <em>Principles of the Philosophy of the Future</em>. \"One must have experienced for oneself the liberating effect\" of these books, Engels subsequently wrote. \"We [i.e., the Left Hegelians] all became at once Feuerbachians.\" </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn September 1844, <a href=\"../e/n.htm#engels\">Frederick Engels</a> came to Paris for a few days, and from that time on became Marx&#8217;s closest friend. Shortly after meeting, Marx and Engels worked together to produce the first mature work of <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#marxism\">Marxism</a> &#8211; <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01.htm\" target=\"_top\">The German Ideology</a>. In this work, largely produced in response to Feuerbach&#8217;s materialism, Marx and Engels set down the foundations of <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#marxism\">Marxism</a> with the  <a href=\"../../terms/h/i.htm#historical-materialism\">materialistic conception of history</a>, and broke from Left Hegelian idealism with a critique against Bruno Bauer and Max Stirner. \"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways;\" Marx wrote in an <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm\" target=\"_top\">outline for the begining of the book</a>, \" the point is to <em>change</em> it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the mid to late-1840s both Marx and Engels took a most active\r\npart in the then seething life of the revolutionary groups in Paris (of\r\nparticular importance at the time was <a href=\"../../terms/p/r.htm#proudhonism\">Proudhon's</a> \r\ndoctrine), which Marx broke into pieces in his  <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Poverty of Philosophy</a>, (1847).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the insistent request of the Prussian government, Marx was banished from Paris in 1845, considered by both governments a dangerous revolutionary. Marx then moved to Brussels. In the spring of 1847 Marx and Engels joined a secret propaganda society called the <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-league\">Communist League</a>. Marx and Engels took a prominent part in the League&#8217;s Second Congress (London, November 1847), at whose request they drew up the <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Communist Manifesto</a>, which appeared in February 1848. With outstanding clarity, this work outlines a new world-conception based on <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism\">materialism</a>. This document \r\nanalysises the realm of social life; the theory of the class struggle; the tasks of the <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communists\">Communists</a>; and the revolutionary role of the proletariat &#8211; the creators of a new, <a href=\"../../terms/c/o.htm#communism\">communist  society</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the outbreak of the Revolution of February 1848, Marx was banished from Belgium. He returned to Paris, whence, after the March Revolution, he went to Cologne, Germany, where <a href=\"../../periodicals/n/e.htm#nrz\">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</a> was published from June 1 1848 to May 19 1849, with Marx as editor-in-chief. The victorious counter-revolution first instigated court proceedings against Marx (he was acquitted on February 9, 1849), and then banished him from Germany (May 16, 1849). First Marx went to Paris, where he was again banished after the demonstration of June 13, 1849, and then went to London, where he lived until his death. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMarx&#8217;s life as a political exile was an extremely difficult one, as the correspondence between Marx and Engels clearly reveals. Poverty weighed heavily on Marx and his family; had it not been for Engels&#8217; constant and selfless financial aid, Marx would not only have been unable to complete <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Capital</a> but would have inevitably have been crushed by hunger and malnutrition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe revival of the democratic movements in the late fifties and\r\nin the sixties thrusted Marx back into political work. In 1864 (September\r\n28) the <a href=\"../../orgs/f/i.htm#first-international\">International Working Men&#8217;s Association</a> &#8211; the First\r\nInternational &#8211; was founded in London. Marx was the heart and soul of\r\nthis organization, and author of its <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1864/10/27.htm\" target=\"_top\">first address</a> and of a host of resolutions, declaration and manifestos. In uniting the labor movement of various forms of non-proletarian socialism (Mazzini, Proudhon, <a href=\"../b/a.htm#bakunin\">Bakunin</a>, liberal trade-unionism in Britain, <a href=\"../../terms/l/a.htm#lassallean\">Lassallean</a> deviations to the right, etc.), and in combating the theories of all these sects and schools, Marx here hammered out uniform tactics for\r\nthe proletarian struggle of the working in the various countries. (See Marx&#8217;s writings for the <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1864/iwma/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">First International</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing the downfall of the <a href=\"../../orgs/p/a.htm#paris-commune\">Paris Commune</a> (1871) &#8211; of which Marx gave a clear-cut materialistic analysis of these events in <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The\r\nCivil War In France</a>, 1871 &#8211; and the Bakunin cleavage in the International (See: <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1868/iwma/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Marx&#8217;s conflict with Bakunin</a>), the organization could no longer exist in Europe. After the <a href=\"../../events/h/a.htm#hague-congress\">Hague Congress of the International</a> (1872), the General Council of the International had played its historical part, and now made way for a period of a far greater development of the labor movement in all countries in the world, a period in which the movement grew in scope, and mass socialist working-class parties in individual national states were formed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMarx&#8217;s health became undermined by his strenuous work in the International and his still more strenuous writings and organising. He continued work on the refashioning of political economy and on the completion of Capital, for which he collected a mass of new material and studied a number of languages (Russian, for instance; Marx was fully fluent in German, French, and English). However, ill-health prevented him from completing the last two volumes of Capital (which Engels subsequently put together from Marx&#8217;s notes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMarx&#8217;s wife died on December 2, 1881, and on March 14, 1883, Marx passed away peacefully in his armchair. He lies buried next to his wife at Highgate Cemetery in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\nby V.I.

        "content": "\r\nBorn in Pomerania in 1904 and raised in Berlin by class-conscious parents, Mattick was already at the age of 14 a member of the Spartacists&#8217; Freie Sozialistiche Jugend. In 1918, he started to learn as a toolmaker at Siemens, where he was also elected as the apprentices&#8217; delegate on the workers&#8217; council of the company during the German revolution.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImplicated in many actions during the revolution, arrested several times and threatened with death, Mattick radicalized along the left and oppositional trend of the german communists. After the &#8216;Heidelberg&#8217; split of the KPD(Spartacus) and the formation for the KAPD in the spring of 1920, he entered the KAPD and worked in the youth organization Rote Jugend, writing for its journal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1921 &#8211; at the age of 17 &#8211; Mattick moved to Cologne to find work with Klockner for a while, until strikes, insurrections and a new arrest destroyed every prospect of employment. He was active as an organizer and agitator in the KAPD and the AAU in the Cologne region, where he got to know Jan Appel among others. Contacts were also established with intellectuals, writers and artists working in the AAUE founded by Otto Ruhle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith the continuing decline of radical mass struggle and revolutionary hopes &#8211; especially after 1923 &#8211; and having been unemployed for a number of years, Mattick emigrated to the United States in 1926, whilst still maintaining contacts with the KAPD and the AAU in Germany.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the USA, Mattick carried through a more systematic theoretical study, above all of Karl Marx. In addition, the publication of Henryk Grossmann&#8217;s principal work, <em>Das Akkumulations</em> &#8211; and <em>Zusammenbruchsgesetz des Kapitalistischen Systems</em> (1929), played a fundamental role for Mattick, as Grossmann brought Marx&#8217;s theory of accumulation, which had been completely forgotten, back to the centre of debate in the workers&#8217; movement. To Mattick Marx&#8217;s &#8216;critique of political economy&#8217; became not a purely theoretical matter but rather directly connected to his own revolutionary practice. From this time Mattick focused on Marx&#8217;s theory of capitalist development and its inner logic of contradictions inevitably growing to crisis as the foundation of all political thoughts with the workers&#8217; movement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTowards the end of the 20&#8217;s Mattick had moved to Chicago, where he first tried to unite the different German workers&#8217; orgainizations. In 1931, he tried to revive the <em>Chicagoer Arbeiterzeitung</em>, a newspaper steeped in tradition and at one time edited by August Spies and Joseph Dietzgen, but without success. For a period he joined the Industrial Workers of the World, who were the only revolutionary union organization existing in America which, in spite of national or sectoral differences, assembled all workers in One Big Union, so as to prepare the general strike to bring down capitalism. However, the golden age of the Wobblies&#8217; militant strikes had already passed by the beginning of the &#8217;thirties, and only the emerging unemployed movement again gave the IWW a brief regional development. In 1933 Paul Mattick drafted a programe for the IWW trying to give the Wooblies a more solid &#8216;Marxist&#8217; foundation based on Grossman&#8217;s theory, although it did not improve the organization&#8217;s condition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some unsuccessful attempts to exercise an influence from the outside on the leninist United Workers Party, Mattick finally founded a council communist group in 1934 with some friends who were originally from the IWW as well as with some expelled members of the UWP. The group kept close contacts with the remaining small groups of the German/Dutch left communism in Europe and published the journal <em>International Council Correspondence</em>, which up though the 30&#8217;s became a Anglo-American parallel to the Rätekorrespondenz from the Dutch GIC(H). Articles and debates from Europe were translated along with economic analysis and critical political comments of current issues in the US and elsewhere in the world.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nApart from his own factory work, Mattick organized not only most of the review&#8217;s technical work but was also the author of the greater part of the contributions which appeared in it. Among the few willing to offer regular contributions was Karl Korsch, with whom Mattick had come into contact in 1935 and who remained a personal friend for many years from the time of his emigration to the United States at the end of 1936.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the European &#8216;council communism&#8217; went underground and formally &#8216;disappeared&#8217; in the second half of the 30&#8217;s Mattick let &#8216;Correspondence&#8217; change its name &#8211; from 1938 to <em>Living Marxism</em>, and from 1942 to <em>New Essays</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThrough Karl Korsch and Henryk Grossman, Mattick also had some contact to Horkheimer&#8217;s Institut fur Sozialforschung (the later &#8216;Frankfurter School&#8217;). In 1936 he wrote a major sociological study on the American unemployed movement for the Institue, althought it remained in the Institute&#8217;s files, to be published only in 1969 by the SDS publishing house <em>Neue Kritik</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the United States&#8217; entry into the Second World War and the consequent persecution campaign directed against the entire critical intelligentsia, the left in America was liquidated by Macarthyism. Mattick retired, at the beginning of the 50&#8217;s, to the countryside, where he managed to survive through occasional jobs and his activity as a writer. In the postwar development Mattick &#8211; like others &#8211; made only small and occassional political activities, writing small articles for various periodicals from time to time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the 40&#8217;s and up through the 50&#8217;s Mattick went through a study of Keynes, and compiled a series of critical notes and articles against Keynesian theory and practice. In this work he developed Marx&#8217;s and Grossman&#8217;s theory of capitalist development further to meet the new phenomenons and appearences of the modern capitalism critically. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith the general changes of political scene and the re-emergence of more radical thought in the 60&#8217;s Mattick made some more extensive and important contributions. One main work was &#8216;Marx and Keynes. The Limits of Mixed Economy&#8217; from 1969, which was translated into several languages and had quite an influence in the post-68 student movement. Another important work was &#8216;Critique of Herbert Marcuse &#8211; The one-dimensional man in class society&#8217;, in which Mattick forcefully rejected the thesis according to which the &#8220;proletariat&#8221;, as Marx understood it had become a &#8220;mythological concept&#8221; in advanced capitalist society. Although he agreed with Marcuse&#8217;s critical analysis of the ruling ideology, Mattick demonstrated that the theory of one dimensionality itself existed only as ideology. Marcuse subsequentially affirmed that Mattick&#8217;s critique was the only serious one to which his book was subjected.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUp through the 70&#8217;s a lot of old and new articles were published in different languages for various publications. In the academic year 1974-75 Mattick was engaged as &#8216;visiting professor&#8217; at the &#8216;red&#8217; University-Center of Roskilde in Denmark. Here he held lectures on Marx&#8217; critique of political economy, on the history of the workers movement and served as critical co-referent at seminars with other guests such as Maximilian Rubel, Ernest Mandel, Joan Robinson and others. In 1977, he completed his last important lecture tour of the University of Mexico City. He spoke in West Germany only twice: in 1971 at Berlin and in 1975 at Hanover.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his last years Paul Mattick thus succeeded in getting an audience in new generations for his views. In 1978 a major collection of articles from over 40 years appeared as &#8216;Anti-Bolshevik Communism&#8217;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul Mattick died in February 1981 leaving an almost finished manuscript for another book, which was laler edited and published by his son, Paul Mattick Jr., as &#8216;Marxism – Last Refuge of the Bourgeoisie?&#8217;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20090221055640/www.kurasje.org/\" target=\"_top\">Kurasje-Archive</a>, which also has a number of Mattick's works.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/mattick-paul/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Paul Mattick Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

By the time of the 1905 revolution Mayakovsky was already working with the local Social Democrats, and when his family moved to Moscow a couple of years later he joined the Bolsheviks. He did propaganda work for the party until his arrest in 1908, which resulted in an imprisonment of eleven months.</p>\r\n<p>The imprisonment was crucial to his artistic and political development, as he spent the time reading the classics of world literature. Nevertheless, upon leaving prison he became a key figure of the artistic avant-garde in Moscow, becoming a Futurist, an artistic movement resolutely opposed to all that was old and bucolic, and which praised the city, speed, and modernity. As their manifesto said: &#8220;We alone are the face of our time. Time&#8217;s trumpet blares in our art of words. The past is stifling…Throw Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, etc, overboard.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>From this time until the revolutions of 1917 Mayakovsky was one of the most visible members of the Russian artistic scene. He wrote rough, declamatory poetry and cultivated the image of a hooligan, and poems he wrote during this period, like &#8220; The Cloud in Trousers&#8221; and &#8220;I,&#8221; were among the most important of the time.</p>\r\n<p>Though Futurism in its original Italian form led directly to fascism, Mayakovsky&#8217;s combination of Futurism and residual Bolshevism led him to welcome the October Revolution, and he put his considerable talents at the service of the new state. He produced posters, films and political poems in order to reach as broad a mass as possible. The death of Lenin profoundly moved him, and he gave countless readings in factories, clubs, and at party meetings around the Soviet Union of his poem &#8220;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>But he didn&#8217;t deny settle into a populist mode, and was a leading light of LEF, the Left Front in Literature, which included all the modernist figures in the Soviet arts world. When their magazine folded Mayakovsky traveled to Europe and the US in 1925-26, a trip which left him hating capitalism even more. It was this period that gave birth to poems like &#8220;Back Home,&#8221; where he asked &#8220;Gosplan to sweat/ in debate/ assigning me goals a year ahead.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>But he refused to see Soviet reality in strictly rosy colors, at one point even going so far as planning to write a poem entitled &#8220;Bad,&#8221; and in 1928 he wrote &#8220;The Bedbug,&#8221; a play that criticized the NEPmen of the previous years, while holding out the hope of a beautiful communist future. A critical failure, he followed it two years later with a more openly critical play about Soviet reality, &#8220;The Bathhouse,&#8221; which, after being turned down by Soviet censors, was reworked, mounted, and critically savaged, a writer for <em>Pravda</em> going so far as to say he was playing the Trotskyist&#8217;s game. </p>\r\n<p>Though he tried to defend himself in poetry in &#8220;At the Top of My Voice,&#8221; the attacks on &#8220;The Bathhouse,&#8221; and the threats implied by the constant attacks by RAPP, the Federation of Proletarian Writers, broke him physically and morally. He had also always had an emotionally stormy romantic life, including a long and intense affair with Lily Brik, a married woman whose sister Elsa was later to marry the French Communist poet Louis Aragon. All was coming apart at once, and after a stay in a rest home he, who had harshly criticized the poet Sergei Esenin for taking his own life in 1925, committed suicide on April 14, 1930. In his suicide note he wrote: &#8220;Do not blame anyone for my death and please do not gossip. The deceased terribly dislike this sort of thing. Mamma, sisters and comrades, forgive me &#8212; this is not a way out (I do not recommend it to others), but I have none other. Lily &#8212; love me…Comrades of VAPP [the all-union organization of RAPP] &#8212; do not think me weak-spirited. Seriously &#8212; there was nothing else I could do.

        "content": "\nGovan Mbeki was a warrior - a revolutionary, an educator, a publicist, organiser and leader of our people over many decades. A man who has brought with him the rare qualities of selflessness and utter devotion to the cause of the oppressed and exploited millions of our country.</p>\n<h5>\nMakings of a revolutionary</h5>\n<p>\nGovan Mbeki was born in the Transkei on 9 July 1910. He spent the better part of his early life in the Transkei and came to gain a first hand knowledge of the conditions and problems facing the majority of the small peasants in the area, a phenomenon which was to be found in most other parts of South Africa at the time.</p>\n<p>\nFrom being one of the most important producers of grain and wool for export at the time of the discovery of gold and diamonds the Transkei at the turn of the century was gradually being reduced to critical dependence on the developing capitalist economy ushered in by the mining revolution. It was the intimate knowledge gained during this time that enabled him to write with such incision on the relationship between migrant labour and capitalist production.</p>\n<p>\nGovan received his early education through mission schools. He passed his high school examinations and went on to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of Fort Hare. In 1936 he completed his degree in Politics and Psychology together with a Teaching Diploma.</p>\n<p>\nHis teaching career was short-lived. It ended with the sack on every occasion because of his political activities among the students and the local community, and for organising workers and trade unions. If the conditions in the Transkei made a deep impression on Govan, his experiences in Johannesburg, where he moved to early in 1929 completed the picture of the desperate plight of the African working people throughout the country: &#8220;Once again I saw the poverty of the black Africans. Where I lived - in the city and in the suburbs - police raids were always taking place. Either they wanted to check our passes, or were looking for illegal drink. No other event up till then had provoked my anger as much as those raids and I decided definitely to join the struggle to put an end to such a system.&#8221; </p>\n<p>\nEarlier in 1925 he had become interested in the activities of the Industrial and Commercial Worker&#8217;s Union (ICU), the first mass-based worker&#8217;s movement in South Africa of black workers.</p>\n<p>\nBy 1938 he had abandoned the idea of a career in teaching and back in the Transkei devoted himself to local politics and writing. The first publication was a magazine called &#8220;Territorial Magazine&#8221; later renamed &#8220;Inkundla Ya Bantu&#8221;. In 1939 he published his first essays in book form, &#8220;The Transkei in the Making&#8221;. By 1941 he was actively involved in a number of local and regional organisations such as the Transkei Voters Association, Transkei Organised Bodies, and the Transkei Territorial Authorities General Council, the Bunga, as it was commonly known, a government inspired creation of elected members, such as Govan, and nominated chiefs, which had very limited administrative powers in the Transkei.</p>\n<p>\nGovan was to refer to the latter organisation as a toy telephone: &#8220;You can say what you like but your words have no effect because the wires are not connected to an exchange.&#8221; </p>\n<p>\nGovan established widespread contacts during this period and working through such organisations. At the same time, through his writings and his activity, he came to be respected and accepted as &#8220;a man of the people&#8221;. Always the practical revolutionary Govan, even in this period, did not confine himself to agitating and organising people politically, but attempted to assist the small peasants by encouraging them to form simple co-operatives, to pool their resources and labour, so as to improve production. He published an easily understood pamphlet on co-operative farming.</p>\n<h5>\nThe Liberation Press</h5>\n<p>\nGovan Mbeki was among those who early on recognised the power of the written word as much as that of action by the people in the liberation struggle. As well as possessing a sharp mind, he had a literary ability which was capable of translating the reality of apartheid South Africa in its social, political, economic and other facets in to the written word. His early efforts were mainly due to his own initiative. But in 1954 he joined the editorial board of New Age which was to be the only national newspaper serving the liberation movement for the next eight years. Together with Ruth First and Brian and Sonya Bunting and the other members of the editorial board, Govan played an immensely important role in ensuring that the pages and columns reflected the conditions of the black peoples, their demands and aspirations.</p>\n<p>\nGovan and his staff on the &#8220;Eastern desk&#8221; of New Age were responsible for opening the eyes of black South Africans, especially the political leadership of the movement, to the fierce and bloody struggles in the countryside between the regime and the peasants from the period 1956 to 1960.</p>\n<p>\nIn November, 1962 the then Minister of Justice, JB Vorster, banned New Age, a fate which had befallen its predecessor, The Guardian, almost 10 years earlier. When the Editorial Board came out with its successor, Spark, Vorster went one step further by banning not the newspaper, but its editors and writers - stopping them from having anything to do with the preparation, editing, printing and distribution of the paper. Changing the names of the liberation newspapers had been the name of the game till them. Changing its makers proved impossible.</p>\n<p>\nRather than remain cut off from the movement Govan went underground. The first explosions of the armed struggle had already rocked South Africa on the 16th December, 1961.</p>\n<h5>\nSouth Africa: The Peasants&#8217; Revolt</h5>\n<p>\nBetween 1956 and 1960 one of the fiercest of confrontations between oppressor and oppressed in South Africa took place. The epic of the heroic resistance and violent confrontation is to be found in Govan Mbeki&#8217;s book &#8220;South Africa: The Peasants&#8217; Revolt&#8221;. The book, which was begun on rolls of toilet paper and smuggled out while Govan was awaiting trial under the Explosives Act, earned him international recognition and an honorary doctorate of Social Science from the University of Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>\nMuch of the book deals with the revolutionary potential of the poor peasants and agricultural workers. Between 1956 and 1960 revolts broke out in many parts of the countryside. Notably in Zeerust, Sekhukhuniland, Zululand and finally in Pondoland where the confrontation took on the form of a sustained armed conflict. The causes were many: the imposition of government-favoured chiefs, the deportation or arrest of popular ones; pass laws for women and increased state taxes; forced removals, cattle culling and dipping, land rehabilitation schemes. The terror and repression let loose was terrible as armed units of the fascist state moved in with armoured cars and helicopters. In Sekhukhuniland 16 peasants, including women, were executed. In Pondoland more than 5,000 were arrested and detained. In every area hundreds of arrests, imprisonment and deportations were taking place.</p>\n<p>\nThe height of organised revolt to white domination and its local lackeys was in Pondoland where the people set up their own administration - Intaba - The Mountain Committee. Resistance was skilfully organised, fearless and sustained.</p>\n<p>\nThe peasants, Govan concluded, had demonstrated to the movement in practice what it had always preached in theory, namely, impoverished peasantry, many of them semi-proletarians, constituted a revolutionary force of immense potential, once organised</p>\n<h5>\nArmed struggle</h5>\n<p>\nEven as editor of the New Age in the Eastern Cape, Govan was immersed in the practical politics of mass political mobilisation, organising branches of the ANC, publicising the movement&#8217;s policies. He was chairman of the ANC in the Eastern Cape, and places like New Brighton became synonymous with ANC militancy. At the same time he was an active member of the underground Communist Party.</p>\n<p>\nWhen the limits of peaceful, non-violent struggle were exhausted and the decision taken to continue the political struggle using all means, including armed struggle, Govan became one of the key figures of the underground leadership. It was in this capacity that he was arrested at Rivonia and later sentenced to life imprisonment with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Elias Motsoaledi, Ahmed Kathrada, Denis Goldberg, Raymond Mhlaba and Andrew Mhlangeni.</p>\n<p>\nOn June 26th, 1980 the Secretary General of the African National Congress, Alfred Nzo, announced the conferring of the time-honoured title of Isithwalandwe on Govan Mbeki. Govan was not present to receive the highest honour that his people and his movement can bestow on any individual, because he was serving a life imprisonment sentence on Robben Island.</p>\n<p>\nGovan was released from prison on 5 November 1987, and immediately continued with the work of the African National Congress.</p>\n<p>\nBesides &#8220;South Africa: The Peasants&#8217; Revolt&#8221;, Mbeki has also published &#8220;The Struggle for Liberation in South Africa&#8221; (1992) and &#8220;Sunset at Midday&#8221; (1996).</p>\n<p>\nAfter the historic democratic elections of 1994, Govan was elected Deputy President of the Senate.</p>\n<p>\nGovan Mbeki died in September 2001 in Port Elizabeth</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://www.anc.org.za/\" target=\"_top\">ANC Web site</a>.</p>\n<p>\nSee also <a href=\"../../../subject/africa/mbeki/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Govan Mbeki Archive</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../m.htm\">Index of the Letter M</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

        "content": "\r\nBorn June 19 1941, Ireland; died August 1 2007 England.</p>\r\n<p>Joe McCarney was a unique voice in the resurgence of Marxist theory and philosophy that took place in Britain in the 1970s and 1980s. He joined the Radical Philosophy group in 1976, and he was prominent thereafter as a contributor and a member of the editorial collective of the journal. In three meticulously argued books and a number of papers he developed a distinctive perspective on the thought of Marx and Hegel, which was deeply immersed in the original texts and yet thoroughly alive to the realities of present-day capitalism. His writings were a model of clarity both in their exposition of complex issues and in their exact English style.</p>\r\n<p>McCarney held a post as a lecturer in Philosophy at London South Bank University from 1969 until 2000. At the time South Bank was a magnet for working-class students, many of them mature, and also academics, such as McCarney, committed to social equality. The only full-time philosopher at South Bank, McCarney was a gifted teacher. He developed courses there on Political Ideology, Social Philosophy, Human Rights, and Medical Ethics. </p>\r\n<p>The central theme of McCarney&#8217;s work revolved around the question of the relationship of theory and practice in Marx. While it is clear that Marx envisaged his theoretical work as a force on the side of the proletariat in the class struggle, McCarney fiercely opposed the characterization of Marx&#8217;s theory as &#8216;critical social science&#8217;. He felt that its practical significance belongs to its peculiar nature as science, not as critique. In rigorously developing this conception, McCarney suggested that the key to it lay in Marx&#8217;s debt to Hegel. McCarney argued that &#8216;a certain conception of the theory-practice relationship constitutes the core of Marx&#8217;s Hegelianism and embodies the sense in which he remains all his life a faithful Hegelian&#8217;.?</p>\r\n<p>McCarney&#8217;s first book, <b>The Real World of Ideology</b> (1980), set itself squarely against the view (almost universal then and still extremely prevalent today) that by &#8216;ideology&#8217; Marx meant &#8216;false consciousness&#8217;, or a cognitively defective view of the world that was spontaneously produced by social structures. Marx never used the term &#8216;false consciousness&#8217;; it was a coinage of Engels&#8217;s, and even then did not mean what it was taken to mean. (For a review of this myth see McCarney&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm\" target=\"_top\"><b>Ideology and False Consciousness</b></a>&#8217;.) Using a wealth of textual evidence, McCarney argued that for Marx ideology simply meant ideas that serve to advance class interests. The function of ideology is to be the medium of class struggle in the realm of ideas; the ideology of a particular class will consist of the ideological weapons at its disposal in that struggle. As he put it, &#8216;the real world of ideology is class society and class conflict, and it disappears from the historical stage with the close of the epoch that is characterised by those conditions.&#8217;</p>\r\n<p>McCarney then pressed his case further, arguing that the current view of ideology was symptomatic of a &#8216;Western Marxism&#8217; that, in the wake of the defeats of the 1930s, resiled altogether from the idea of class struggle. The result was that figures such as Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Louis Althussser, and later the Althusserians and &#8216;Analytical Marxists&#8217; of his own time, had completely lost touch with the classical tradition of Marx, Engels and Lenin. (Lukács was exempted from this criticism. His most influential works were written while the optimism engendered by the October Revolution still obtained, of course.) </p>\r\n<p>McCarney&#8217;s <b>Social Theory and the Crisis of Marxism</b> (1990) set itself against the stream; as he said, the assumption that an emancipatory socialist theory must be essentially a critique of capitalist society is now so pervasive as to constitute a whole climate of opinion. The central feature of contemporary Marxism, he argued, was that it understood itself as a &#8216;critical theory&#8217; of society: a theory that showed that capitalism failed by some ethical or rational standard. Whether the standard was an external one, as in critiques based on freedom, equality or justice, or whether it was simply one of self-consistency, as in so-called &#8216;immanent critique&#8217;, McCarney asserted that such a conception of his theoretical work was utterly alien to Marx himself. Instead Marx began with the idea that socialism was the &#8216;hidden truth and emergent reality of capitalism&#8217; and that the working class was driven by its circumstances to become the agent that would bring this reality about. Marx conceived his own theory as articulating the understanding of the world that was anyway developing within the working class, so that it would facilitate the overthrow of capitalism without ever involving itself in a moral critique of it. So his theory was an expression of class struggle. (More controversially, McCarney went on to argue that it was no longer possible to identify the working class of the advanced capitalist countries as the agent that would bring about socialism. He added that today we must look to the oppressed masses of the &#8216;Third World&#8217; as the agent of revolution.)</p>\r\n<p>Marx&#8217;s conception of the logical status of his own work committed him to denying that revolutionary theory needs a moral, or indeed any normative, dimension. As McCarney acutely observed, Marx, like Hegel before him, had a kind of aristocratic, proto-Nietzschean, disdain for habits of complaining and fault-finding, and taking refuge in idealistic dreams. But if so, McCarney asked, how does Marx&#8217;s theory have practical significance? The answer lay in a form of knowledge which is expressive of the necessity inherent to its object. Dialectical theory surrenders to the life of its object and seeks to bring that life into the light of consciousness. It cannot add anything of its own without betraying its own character, and in particular must not seek to provide a normative commentary to mediate the stages in the life of the object. From this perspective a central role is assigned to the category of &#8216;contradiction&#8217;; it is above all contradictions that need bringing to light. Such an activity itself transforms the situation, not merely the conceptual field, where self-contradiction is concerned. The proletariat is compelled to rebel by the contradiction of its existence when it becomes aware of its own nature and the nature of its situation. The role of revolutionary theory is to be the self-consciousness of the emancipatory historical subject.</p>\r\n<p>Thus the immediate object of dialectical social science is provided by social contradictions, specifically the intersubjective contradiction of class society. Through the development of social scientific insight, subject classes achieve a grasp of the true nature of their situation. This process includes qualitative leaps made possible by the universalisng power of theoretical concepts. The whole development may be seen as actualizing the contradictions of the preconceptions derived from the ruling ideology and reality as it is experienced and understood. This is the substance of the idea that ratiocination about the desirability of social change is itself already a form of such change. Thus, it serves as the driving force of the dialectic of class-consciousness. More specifically, the conflict between classes can be superseded in a transition to a new society only if the historical process becomes conscious for one of the participants, the proletariat. The process of transition is explicated in terms of the directly transformative power of the discovery of self-contradictions by a historical subject.</p>\r\n<p>The shift from doctrinaire to revolutionary science is precisely that from a normative to a dialectical conception. Once it has taken place, theory is no longer a vision of what ought to be but the voice of an emergent movement of reality which in becoming articulate is enabled to develop its world-transforming potential. It was this conception of social theory, shared by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Lukács, that Marxists needed to recover and develop.</p>\r\n<p>However, the conception of Marxist theory for which McCarney was arguing depended implicitly not only on identifying a revolutionary agent but also on an underlying confidence that history was tending towards socialism, or in Hegelian terms that the rational was becoming real. It was perhaps this that led him to a study of Hegel&#8217;s philosophy of history in the 1990s, culminating in his <b>Hegel on History</b> (2000), a lucid exposition of Hegel&#8217;s conception of history as the emergence of universal human freedom. Hegel was convinced that a people once possessed of the spirit of freedom does not willingly surrender it. Rejecting transcendentalist readings of Spirit, McCarney concluded: &#8216;It is &#8220;We&#8221; who are responsible for sustaining history in its course and bringing it to an end in freedom.&#8217; He reacted to the failure of the Soviet experiment in a true Hegelian spirit, regarding the reunification of East and West as a natural resumption of the march of world history. He often remarked jovially: &#8216;The Absolute is not in a hurry.&#8217; He said he was more of a Marxist Hegelian than a Hegelian Marxist.</p>\r\n<p>He remained to the end of his life a quiet but principled opponent of capitalism, which he once described as &#8216;systematic violence and terror&#8217;. His conception of socialism was typically low key: &#8216;a truly human society, one that does not, by its nature, systematically obstruct the attempts of the mass of its members to cope with the burdens of being human&#8217;.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See: <a href=\"../../../archive/mccarney/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Joe McCarney Archive</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../m.htm\">Index of the Letter M</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

He taught in a number of lyc&eacute;es before World War II, during which he served as an army officer. In 1945 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Lyon and in 1949 was called to the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1952 he received a chair of philosophy at the Coll&egrave;ge de France. From 1945 to 1952 he served as unofficial co-editor (with <a href=\"../../people/s/a.htm#sartre-jean-paul\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>) of the journal <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nMerleau-Ponty's most important works of philosophy were <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/merleaup.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">The  Structure of Behaviour</span></a> (1942) and <span class=\"book\">Phenomenology of Perception</span>  (1945). Though greatly influenced by the work of <a href=\"../../people/h/u.htm#husserl-edmund\">Edmund Husserl</a>, Merleau-Ponty rejected his theory of the knowledge of other persons, grounding his own theory in bodily behaviour and in perception. He held that it is necessary to consider the organism as a whole to discover what will follow from a given set of stimuli. For him, perception was the source of knowledge and had to be studied before the conventional sciences.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nTurning his attention to social and political questions, in 1947 Merleau-Ponty published a group of Marxist essays, <span class=\"book\">Humanism and Terror</span>, the most sophisticated defence of Soviet communism in the late 1940s. He argued for suspended judgment of Soviet terrorism and attacked what he regarded as Western hypocrisy. The Korean War disillusioned Merleau-Ponty and he broke with Sartre, who defended the North Koreans.  </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1955 Merleau-Ponty published more Marxist essays, <span class=\"book\">The Adventures of the Dialectic</span>. This collection, however, indicated a change of position: Marxism no longer appears as the final word on history, but rather as a heuristic methodology. Later he returned to more strictly philosophical concerns.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nBorn on May 29, 1830, in an austere castle called Vroncourt (Haute-Marne) where her mother, Marianne Michel, was a maidservant. Her father was reputed to have been Laurent Demahis, the owner&#8217;s son, but her father may have been the owner himself, Etienne-Charles Demahis. Anyway, her grandparents raised her as a Demahis, and she received a liberal education from them. Her grandfather had her read Voltaire, Rousseau, and the <i>encyclopedists</i>, and her grandmother taught her to sing and play piano. Louise Michel&#8217;s <i>Mémoirs</i> describe her early years as idyllic. In 1850, following her grandparents&#8217; and father&#8217;s deaths, her stepmother drove her from the castle.</p>\r\n<p>She was forced to look for a way to earn her own living. She chose to become an elementary teacher and so attended a teacher&#8217;s training academy in Chaumont. In 1852, after obtaining her diploma, she opened a private school in Audeloncourt, not far from Vroncourt. But many parents didn&#8217;t like her methods: she took her pupils outdoors so they could discover nature and she also taught them to sing the <i>Marseillaise</i>. These actions led to her repeatedly being called to the <i>Préfet</i>&#8217;s office for a reprimand. Later, together with her friend Julie Longchamp, whom she had met in Chaumont, she opened a girl&#8217;s school in Millières, where she taught for two years.</p>\r\n<p>In 1856 she went to Paris, which always attracted her, to teach in a pension. Nine years later, she bought a private day-school in Montmartre. In this period she attended political meetings, where she met Théophile Ferré and his sister Marie, and became violently anticlerical. She also opposed the Second Empire. On July 12, 1870, along with 100,000 others, she went to the funeral of the journalist Victor Noir, who was killed by Pierre Bonaparte. Afterwards, in July, Napoleon III declared the war on Prussia. His troops were quickly overcome and he became a prisoner. </p>\r\n<p>The Third Republic was proclaimed on September 4, and soon thereafter the Prussians lay siege to Paris. She tried to keep her school open and find food for her students. Her friend Georges Clemenceau, Mayor of Montmartre, helped her.<br />\r\nLouise Michel was very politically engaged in this period; she even created with friends <i>Le Comité de Vigilance des Citoyennes du XVIIIème arrondissement</i> [the Vigilance Committee of the eighteenth arrondissement]. When the <i>bourgeois republic</i> tried to forcibly disarm Parisians, it led to the proclamation of the Paris Commune on March 28, 1871. Louise Michel became an ambulance nurse and soldier, belonging to the <i>Montmartre</i> sixty-first battalion. She was everywhere where she could feel the danger. Finally, she surrendered on May 24 because the <i>Versaillais</i> &#8211; current name of the authorities who were refugees in Versailles &#8211; arrested her mother and threatened to kill her. Her mother was then released, and Louise Michel was incarcerated in Satory prison.</p>\r\n<p>After having defended herself in court, on December 16, 1871, at the age of 41, she was condemned to be deported. While awaiting deportation to New Caledonia, Louise Michel and other prisoners from the Commune were imprisoned in Auberive (Haute-Marne). These included Beatrix Excoffon and Nathalie Lemel. On August 28, 1873, she embarked on the <i>Virginie</i>, arriving four months later at the fortress of Numbo, in the Ducos peninsula. Although life was difficult there, especially with respect to hygiene and food, she enjoyed it. When she was moved to West Bay, in May 1875, she came in contact with the native people and taught them to read and write. She even helped them withstand the French authorities. But she also assisted to their defeat. Later, in 1879, she left West Bay for Nouméa to become a teacher. In the years in exile she became more receptive to anarchist thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>Following the general amnesty for Commune prisoners, she returned to France. At that time, her mother just had a paralysis attack. Louise Michel was triumphantly welcomed by 10 000 persons on November 9, 1880, at St Lazare station in Paris. In this period she attended many meetings in France and abroad, where she spoke about her struggle for Social Revolution and anarchism. While such meetings were expensive, Louise Michel viewed them as a way for the middle-classes to contribute to the workers. </p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 1883, she and Emile Pouget led a demonstration of unemployed workers. She was arrested a month later and imprisoned in <i>St Lazare</i>. Again she defended herself at the trial, but was sentenced to six years in prison. She was transferred to the Clermont detention center (in Oise), which was strictly directed by <i>Versaillais</i>. However, in December 1884, she was authorized to join her mother&#8217;s bedside thanks to her friends Clemenceau, Rochefort and Vaughan. Her mother died on January 3, 1885. Louise Michel was released a year later, when she was 56. </p>\r\n<p>The next five years were spent alternating between attending meetings or in prison. There was even an attempt on her life during a meeting in Le Havre, in 1888, when the extremist Pierre Lucas shot her, but she quickly recovered. In 1890, tired of the gossip and calumny against her, she moved to London. Five years later, her friend Charlotte Vauvelle, who came from the anarchist circle of London, joined her and became a very precious help in her movings. She began to teach again and to lecture. She also gave free lessons of French. As an anarchist, she agreed with the anarchists&#8217; attempts in France. In the last ten years of her life, she traveled between London and Paris, participating in many political meetings and conferences. She also visited comrades in the Netherlands and Belgium. She died in Marseille on January 9, 1905, while on a lecture tour in the south of France.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">Hélène Saudrais: <a href=\"http://www.iisg.nl/collections/louisemichel/\" target=\"_top\">http://www.iisg.nl/collections/louisemichel/</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../history/france/paris-commune/michel-louise/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Louise Michel Archive</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n"

While holding that things did not exist outside of perception, Mill generally regarded the question of the existence of things outside of perception as a meaningless question to be given too much attention; Mill proposed induction as the only valid form of acquiring knowledge of perception, and belittled the role of deduction.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe eldest son of the British historian, political economist and philosopher <a href=\"#mill-james\">James Mill</a>, he was educated exclusively by his father, a strict disciplinarian. By the age of eight, he had read most of the Greek classics and made his own translation of many, read a great deal of history and started Latin, the geometry of Euclid, and algebra. By the age of 10 could read Plato and others with ease. About the age of 12, he began a thorough study of Scholastic logic, reading Aristotle in the original. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Spending most of his time with his father, Mill acquired much of his father's opinions and methods. <a href=\"../b/e.htm#bentham-jeremy\">Jeremy Bentham</a> was a family friend and the other principal influence of his ideas and at the age of 16, Mill established the <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1863/utility/ch01.htm\" target=\"_top\">Utilitarian Society</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom 1830-45, Mill contributed prolifically to a wide variety of journals and magazines on social, political, historical and literary questions and published a number of books and essays. During these years Mill also wrote his major works on logic and political economy. <a href=\"../../people/c/o.htm#comte-auguste\">Auguste Comte</a> was an influence here, but the main inspiration came from <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/newton.htm\" target=\"_top\">Isaac Newton</a>, whose physics he took as a model of scientific exposition. He determined himself to compose a Logic in which due place would be given to <a href=\"../../terms/i/n.htm#induction\">Induction</a> as opposed to deduction which was the principal focus of traditional expositions of Logic. <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1843/logic.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">A System of Logic</span></a> was published in 1843 including an attempt to formulate a logic of the human sciences based on causal explanation conceived in <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/hume.htm\" target=\"_top\">Humean</a> terms. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1844, he published the <span class=\"book\">Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy</span>, much as a disciple of <a href=\"../r/i.htm#ricardo-david\">David Ricardo</a>. He also studied the writings of early Socialists, but he never adhered to any element of socialism. In 1848, he published <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/principles-political-economy/ch301.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Principles of Political Economy</span></a>, in which he had arrived at the conclusion that value could only be the <em>average price</em> of a commodity, and the search for an <em>objective substratum</em> of value was mistaken, proposing instead that political economy should in future concentrate its attention on price-formation rather than &#8216;value&#8217;. Thus although Mill did not succeed in making this step himself, he can be seen as an important precursor for the &#8220;Marginal Revolution&#8221; of <a href=\"../w/a.htm#walras-leon\">Walras</a> and <a href=\"../j/e.htm#jevons-william\">Jevons</a>. Around the same time, Mill advocated the creation of peasant proprietorships as a remedy for the disorder in Ireland.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor 20 years, from 1836 (when his father died) to 1856, Mill had charge of the British East India Company's relations with the Indian states. On the dissolution of the British East India Company, Mill was offered a seat in the new council set up to govern India, but he declined it and retired with a pension of 1,500 pounds.

A controversial figure, Mills advocated a comparative world sociology and criticized intellectuals for not using their freedom responsibly by working for social change. For his part, despite a professorial chair and his books more widely read than any of the genre, he was a frenetic pamphleteer and agitator.</p>\r\n<p>His social theory was influenced by both Marx and Weber. His best-known book is <em>The Power Elite</em> (1956), explained the power structure of postwar American society in terms of the &#8220;power elite&#8221; which came to be known as the &#8216;military-industrial complex,&#8217; each serving each others&#8217; needs for the production and use of military spending. Mills&#8217;s other books include <em>White Collar</em> (1951), in which he discussed the propertyless middle-class whose loyalty maintained the position of the ruling elite, <em>The Sociological Imagination</em> (1959), <em>Listen, Yankee</em> (1960), and <em>The Marxists</em> (1962). </p>\r\n<p>In <em>The Marxists,</em> he wrote that political philosophy had to encompass not only an analysis of society and a set of theories of how it works but &#8220;an ethic, an articulation of <em>ideals.</em>&#8221; It followed that intellectuals should be explicit about their values and that research work should be supplemented by blunt writing that was meant to both inform and <em>mobilise</em>. </p>\r\n<p>Mills coined the term &#8220;New Left&#8221; with the open letter he wrote in 1960 entitled <em>Letter to the New Left</em> arguing for a move away from focus on labour issues, towards more &#8220;humanist&#8221; issues such as alienation, anomie, authoritarianism, and other ills of the modern affluent society. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../subject/humanism/mills-c-wright/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">C.

After completing his post-graduation in Mathematics, he  \r\njoined the Regional Engineering College at Durgapur, West Bengal in  \r\n1966 in the faculty of mechanical engineering. It was here that he  \r\nbecame actively involved with the Indian Communist Movement of the  \r\n'60s (popularly termed as the Naxalbari uprising) that challenged the  \r\nofficial policies followed by the Indian government in relation to  \r\nthe prevailing food crisis of the times, unemployment, poverty,  \r\ncorruption and general misrule by the Congress ministry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSharp ideological debates over the programme and political agenda to  \r\nbe followed by the Communist parties intensified during this period  \r\nleading to the birth of the Communist Party of India Marxist (CPI-M)  \r\nfrom the Communist Party of India (CPI) and then the Communist Party  \r\nof India Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) under the aegis of Charu Mazumdar.  \r\nIt is hardly surprising that by 1969, young Mishra decided the future  \r\ncourse of his career as a professional revolutionary and became a  \r\n\"whole-timer\" (full time activist) of the newly formed CPI-ML.

In the later half of the 1930s, Amakasu joined Tosaka&#8217;s Materialist Study Group, which was formed in 1932 and would serve as one of the last strongholds for leftwing intellectuals in the latter half of the 1930s. During the mid-Thirties, Amakasu wrote two books: <em>Geijutsu ron</em> (<em>Theory of Art</em>) and <em>Heegeru he no michi</em> (<em>The Road to Hegel</em>). In January 1940 he was arrested under the Peace Preservation Act, and spent the year in prison. Immediately following the war he was primarily engaged in criticism of the Japanese idealist philosophers Nishida and Tanabe, taking an active role in organizations aligned with the Japanese Communist Party, such as the Association of Democratic Scientists. Upon becoming a professor at Osaka City University in 1952, his primary field of interest shifted from philosophy to political economy. It was at that time that he also changed his family name from Amakasu to Mita. In his study of Marxist political economy, Mita carried over his interest in philosophy, particularly the ideas of Hegel, concentrating above all on Marx&#8217;s method in <em>Capital</em>.

He travelled widely, spending two years in England (1729-31), but was troubled by poor eyesight, and was completely blind by the time of his death in 1755.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis great work, <em>De l'esprit des lois</em> was published anonymously in 1748 and was enormously influential. He argued that the aristocracy protected the state from the absolutist despot (or monarchy) and from the despotism of the many. His was a purely political and rational defense, not economic. Montesquieu's motto was, Freedom-Liberty is the step-child of privilege. This allowed Montesquieu to defend the constitutional monarch as he claimed it was governed by honor. Montesquieu argued that the monarchs could become too passionate and the commons were too big and too egalitarian to rule properly. However, he portrayed the aristocracy as having and maintaining the honor that kept monarchies constitutional. But, he also warned that the aristocracy is doomed when it becomes self-interested, arrogant and parasitic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMontesquieu's most radical work situated the three French classes into a &#8220;checks and balances&#8221; &#8211; a termed he coined &#8211; of three sovereignties: the monarchy, the aristocracy and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of powers existing: the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. These powers were to be divided up amongst the three classes so that each would have a power over the other. This is so radical because it completely eliminates the clergy from the estates and because it erases any last vestige of a feudalistic structure. </p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/montesqu.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Spirit of Laws</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nMore was a very important politician and intellectual of his time, at the\r\npeak of his career being Lord Chancellor of England under Henry VIII. He was\r\na famous opponent of Protestantism, and wrote a number of extremely\r\npolemical works on the matter, finally being banned from publishing by the\r\ngovernment. He was eventually consigned to the Tower of London for his\r\ndogged defence of Catholicism, and then beheaded after being tried for\r\ntreason. For this he was canonised in 1935 by Pope Pius XI.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile for some More is inevitably remembered for his services to\r\nCatholicism, his &#8220;Utopia&#8221; is completely unconcerned with Catholic issues,\r\nand it is in bequeathing this word to the English language that he has had\r\nthe greatest influence. Although obviously founded from an ancient Greek\r\netymology, the term &#8220;utopia&#8221; as we use it actually originates in Thomas\r\nMore&#8217;s 1515 book of that name, and More&#8217;s book still provides us with a\r\ncomplex meditation on issues and questions that remain prescient, such as\r\n&#8220;What is a utopia?&#8221; &#8220;Is a utopia a mere fantasy, a guiding ideal, or\r\nsomething else?&#8221; &#8220;Can the utopian be more than an ideal?&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn our usage of this word it is often forgotten that many of these complex\r\nissues had already been played upon by More, and the word is even thrown\r\naround as a simple pejorative (see e.g. Engels&#8217; &#8220;Socialism: Utopian and\r\nScientific&#8221;). &#8220;Utopia&#8221; has come to signify the romance of an ideal unrelated\r\nto reality, and thus increasingly seems to signify something tragic or\r\nsimply pathetic; an unfulfilled or unfulfillable dream.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMore, however, was already well aware of these possible aspects to the\r\nutopian. The title of the book, for example, is famously a self-undermining\r\njoke: u-topia means &#8220;non-place&#8221; or &#8220;nowhere&#8221;. In fact, More revels in such\r\ntricks, and has the description of the island of Utopia narrated by a\r\n&#8220;Raphael Hythloday&#8221;, whose name roughly translates as &#8220;talker of nonsense&#8221;.\r\nIt is hard to fathom the extent to which such tropes are merely More&#8217;s\r\nmischievous sense of humour, and the extent to which they are a political\r\nsafeguard for a book which could have got him into trouble. Since the first\r\nhalf of the book contains a sustained social criticism of the England of his\r\nday, and the second proposes an alternative, it is impossible not to reason\r\nthat there is a great deal more at stake than More&#8217;s sense of humour; but is\r\nall this irony simply political self-defence? We can at least say that he\r\ndoes not merely mean to argue that &#8220;utopias&#8221; are by definition vacuous ideas\r\nthat are unworthy of attention.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe addenda to &#8220;Utopia&#8221; are commonly forgotten, but in many senses they are\r\nthe key to the rest of the book. These, presented as an assemblage of\r\ndocumentary fragments, tell us of a place that is on the fringes of real\r\nknowledge- an alphabet is known, but not included here; maps do not exist,\r\nbut one missing sailor knows the way, and so on. Most importantly, More\r\nrenders the apparent joke of his title distinctly ambivalent, as he tells us\r\nin verse that the island is not correctly the &#8220;nowhere place&#8221; of u-topia,\r\nbut the &#8220;good place&#8221; of eu-topia. His self-undermining joke is thus itself\r\nin a sense placed &#8220;under erasure&#8221;, and the island is reasserted as a good\r\nplace. Furthermore, he compares his Utopia to Plato&#8217;s Republic, and in doing\r\nso plays upon a tension between the ideal and the real:</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;I one of all other without philosophy<br />\r\nHave shaped for man a philosophical city.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nand,</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\n&#8220;For what Plato&#8217;s pen hath platted briefly<br />\r\nIn naked words as in a glass,<br />\r\nThe same have I performed fully.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith his many references to philosophical ideals, poetry and language, as he\r\ncompletes his book, it would seem that More is partly alluding to how\r\nutopias may be constructions of language, and that his is necessarily prior\r\nto completion &#8211; for the Utopian alphabet itself is missing. Yet we should not\r\nover-emphasise the latter poetic aspects of the book; rather, Utopia is a\r\nconstruction of two complementary halves, and the first of these is a piece\r\nof social criticism. More, in fact, seems to have consciously divided Utopia\r\nbetween real (the First Book) and ideal (the Second Book), and the whole can\r\nbe read as a play on the tension between these two, which is underlined by\r\nhis play on the names &#8220;Utopia&#8221; and &#8220;Eutopia&#8221;. Perhaps it is that More&#8217;s work\r\nshows us that social criticism must work between these two poles; that it\r\ntakes its authority not only from the positively real, but also from the\r\nimpossibly idealistic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the narrator says, speaking More&#8217;s thoughts at the conclusion to Book\r\nTwo: there is much to wish for in Utopia, though there may be doubt about\r\nsuch things ever coming to be. It is, however, certain that More wished that\r\nthe Utopian were not only &#8220;nowhere&#8221;, but that the Eutopian (the good place)\r\nmight actually come about.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/more/works/utopia/index.html\" target=\"_top\">Utopia</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">Rob Lucas</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Muralov was subsequently commander of the Moscow Military district, and a hero of the Civil War. Once Deputy Commissar of Agriculture, himself an agronomist, he was one of the few old Bolsheviks who, like Rykov and Shliapnikov, participated directly and actively in the 1905 revolution. Imprisoned for insufficient sycophancy to Stalin, and shot in 1937.</p> \r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nMy unbroken fighting friendship as well as my political friendship with Muralov began then. I must say at least a few words about the man. Muralov is an old Bolshevik who went through the revolution of 1905 in Moscow. In Serpukhov, in 1906, he was caught in the pogrom of the Black Hundred &#8211; carried out, as usual, under the protection of the police. Muralov is a magnificent giant, as fearless as he is kind. With a few others, he found himself in a ring of enemies who had surrounded the building of the Zemstvo administration. Muralov came out of the building with a revolver in his hand and walked evenly toward the crowd. It moved back a little. But the shock company of the Black Hundred blocked his path, and the cabmen began to howl taunts at him. &#8220;Clear a way,&#8221; ordered the giant without slackening his advance, as he raised the hand holding the revolver. Several men pounced on him. He shot one of them down and wounded another. The crowd drew back again. With the same even step, cutting his way through the crowd like an ice-breaker, Muralov walked on and on toward Moscow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nHis subsequent trial lasted for two years, and, in spite of the frenzy of the reaction that swept over the country, he was acquitted. An agricultural expert by training, a soldier in an automobile detachment during the imperialist war, a leader of the October fighting in Moscow, Muralov became the first commander of the Moscow military region after the victory. He was a fearless marshal of the revolutionary war, always steady, simple, and unaffected. In his campaigning he was a tireless living example; he gave agricultural advice, mowed grain, and in his free moments gave medical treatment to both men and cows. In the most difficult situations he radiated calm, warmth, and confidence. After the close of the war, Muralov and I always tried to spend our free days together. We were united too by our love of hunting. We scoured North and South for bears and wolves, or for pheasants and bustards. At present, Muralov is hunting in Siberia as an exiled oppositionist.</p>\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">\r\nIn the July days of 1917, Muralov held his head up, as usual, and encouraged many others. In those days, we all needed a lot of self-control to stride along the corridors and halls of the Taurid Palace without bowing our heads, as we ran the gauntlet of furious glances, venomous whispers, grinding of teeth, and a demonstrative elbowing that seemed to say: &#8220;Look! Look !&#8221; There is no fury greater than that of a vain and pampered &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; philistine when he begins to perceive that the revolution which has suddenly lifted him to the top is about to threaten his temporary splendor.<br />\r\n[From <a href=\"../../../archive/trotsky/1930/mylife/ch26.htm\">My Life</a>, Trotsky 1930]</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The trial showed that after the war broke out members of the R.S.D.L. group travelled through almost the whole of Russia for propaganda purposes, that Muranov, Petrovsky, Badayev and others arranged numerous workers&#8217; meetings, at which anti-war resolutions were passed, and so forth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\n<a href=\"../../../archive/lenin/works/1915/s-w/ch02.htm\">Socialism and War</a>, Lenin</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1904 Muranov joined the Bolshevik Party.

        "content": "\r\nJohn Thomas (J.T.) Murphy was a leading British trade unionist and significant figure in 20th century British Communism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBorn in Manchester, England, economic hardships forced him to leave school at age 13 to apprentice at the Vickers engineering factory. He continued to study, however, and soon he became a superintendent of a local Sunday School and a preacher in the Primitive Methodist Church. This, Murphy stated, prepared him well for a life of public speaking.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTheological debates with Socialists in the factory, along with his continued studies of philosophy, evolution and other sciences&#8212;all in the context of the bitter labor struggles of the time&#8212;led Murphy to abandon his religious faith and embrace militant industrial unionism. Influenced by <a href=\"../../../archive/mann-tom/index.htm\">Tom Mann</a> and <a href=\"../../../archive/connolly/index.htm\">James Connolly</a>, Murphy rejected parliamentary reformism and came to believe that Socialism could only be achieved through working class independence and militant struggle.</p> \r\n<p>\r\nWorld War I presented new opportunities to put theory into practice. Across the country rank-and-file movements headed by shop stewards battled not only employers, but also challenged the authority of the union bureaucracies for their class collaborationist policies and outright betrayals. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the war dragged on, the need for materiel to fuel the war effort greatly impacted the engineering industry. Murphy was active in the ensuing struggles through his involvement with the Sheffield Workers&#8217; Committee, which brought him in contact with the future founding members and early leading figures of the Communist Party of Great Britain: <a href=\"../../../archive/gallacher/index.htm\">William Gallacher</a>, <a href=\"../../../archive/bell/index.htm\">Tom Bell</a>, <a href=\"../../../archive/paul-william/index.htm\">William Paul</a> and <a href=\"../../../archive/mcmanus/index.htm\">Arthur MacManus</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1917 Murphy was elected to the national leadership of the Workers&#8217; Committees and Shop Stewards&#8217; Movement, the National Administrative Council (NAC), along with Arthur MacManus, who ultimately recruited Murphy to the Socialist Labour Party (SLP). During this period, Murphy&#8217;s stature as a respected leader and theorist continued to grow. His political thought in the years following the Russian Revolution evolved from De Leonist syndicalism to Bolshevism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn January 1919, Murphy, MacManus, Paul and Bell represented the SLP in discussions with other revolutionary socialist groups in Britain to form a single Party, a Communist Party, affiliated with the <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international\">Third (Communist) International</a>. These negotiations were long and contentious and stalled over a number of issues, primarily affiliation with the Labour Party. Before their conclusion, Murphy traveled to Moscow as part of the British delegation to the Second Congress of the Comintern where his political evolution to <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#marxism-leninism\">Marxism-Leninism</a> was finalized.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile in Moscow, Murphy took part in the early efforts to establish a Red trade union International&#8212;later named the <a href=\"../../orgs/r/e.htm#red-international-labor-unions\">Red International of Labor Unions</a> (RILU), also called the &#8220;Profintern&#8221;&#8212;to unite revolutionary trade unionists worldwide into a single organization to rival the reformist Amsterdam International. Along with <a href=\"../../../archive/rosmer/index.htm\">Alfred Rosmer</a> and <a href=\"../../../archive/tomsky/index.htm\">Mikhail Tomsky</a>, Murphy was elected to the provisional leadership and was tasked with the responsibility of returning to England to establish the British Bureau, and then travel back to Moscow for its first Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to his work with the RILU, Murphy was a significant figure in the Comintern. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) and headed the British section, which included Ireland and the colonies, and, later, the Anglo-American Committee. He was also a member of the Eastern Commission that handled issues relating to China and Japan, and, in 1926, was elected to the Presidium and Political Secretariat.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis rise in the Comintern apparatus coincided with Stalin&#8217;s consolidation of power. Murphy was acutely aware of the CPSU&#8217;s internal conflicts and ultimately sided with <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/stalin/index.htm\">Stalin</a> over <a href=\"../../../archive/trotsky/index.htm\">Trotsky</a> and the <a href=\"../../orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition\">Left Opposition</a>. Following the Fifth Congress of the Comintern in 1924, Murphy returned to England and, at a council meeting of the CPGB, moved the main resolution denouncing Trotsky for his &#8220;open attack upon the present leadership of the Communist International, which in the opinion of the CPGB, will not only definitely encourage the British Imperialists, the bitterest enemies of Soviet Russia, but will also encourage their lackeys of the Second International, and those other elements who stand for the liquidation of the Communist International and the Communist Party in this country.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThree years later, it was Murphy who moved the Presidium resolution expelling Trotsky from the ECCI.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1932 Murphy came into conflict with the CPGB leadership when he advanced the idea that the Party should mount a campaign to pressure employers and the British government to give credits for industrial products to the Soviet Union. <a href=\"../../../archive/pollitt/index.htm\">Harry Pollitt</a>, the Party&#8217;s General Secretary, disagreed on the grounds that this would solve the country&#8217;s market crisis and undermine current campaigns. He demanded that Murphy publicly admit his mistake. Murphy refused, and resigned from the Party.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">(Derived in part from Ralph Darlington&#8217;s <em>The Political Trajectory of J. T.

By the age of 24, Bonaparte considered himself the heir to the (presently non-existent) throne of the great Napoleon. Believing his heritage would inspire the loyalty of French soldiers, Bonaparte attempted and completely failed to win over the Strasbourg garrison for a coup d'état on October 30, 1836. Ruling French King Louis-Philippe exiled him to the United States, but only a few months later Bonaparte returned to Switzerland, to see his dying mother. A year later he was expelled from Switzerland, and immigrated to England.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn August 6, 1840, Bonaparte again attempted a coup from Boulogne, but the local garrison did not join him and his effort miserably failed. Bonaparte was captured, arrested and sentence to permanent imprisonment inside a fortress. Bonapartes' spirit was unhindered, however, and in May 25, 1846, he escaped again to England.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the revolution of 1848 began, Bonaparte hurriedly traveled to France but was immediately sent back to England. Bonapartes supporters, however, among them the Party of Order, supported him in the elections putting his position in the September at five departments, which he took as a start to run for the office of the presidency. After intensive campaigning and propaganda, in December, 1848, Bonaparte was the only candidate voted for. In the presidency, Bonaparte immediately sent French legions to help the Pope reconquer Rome and at home he subdued workers with stern brutality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBonaparte spent much of this time consolidating power, and staffing the government administration with people in support of him.  But the Constitution dictated that the president have only a four-year term, and Bonaparte, not all satisfied with this, sought to amend the Constitution &#8211; but he was unable to get the majority he needed to legally do so.  So on December 2, 1852, before his presidency expired, Louis Bonaparte staged a coup to overthrow the government and install himself as Emperor.[...] \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1870, a Prussian Prince was to become the king of Spain.  This upset Bonaparte to such an extent &#8211; that a relative to the King of Prussia would control Spain &#8211; that France and Prussia plunged into war in July 18, 1870. The war would last for less than six weeks, when defeat after defeat, on September 2, 1870, at the <a href=\"../../events/s/e.htm#sedan-battle\">Battle of Sedan</a>, Bonaparte and his 80,000 troops surrendered to the Prussian army.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBonaparte was, for the last time, exiled to England where he lived for a little more than a year, and died on January 23rd, 1873.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em> Further Reading: </em> Bonaparte, after the coup he led in 1848, was heavily criticized by Marx in his classic work: the <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon</a></span>.

From 1905 to 1907, he served as the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, a volunteer society working to solve the child labor problem in the state.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n14\">[14]</a></sup> From 1908 until 1915, Nearing himself taught economics and sociology at the Wharton School and Swarthmore College, authoring a stream of books on the economics and social problems.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n15\">[15]</a></sup> Nearing was a staunch advocate of a &#8220;new economics&#8221; which insisted</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;that the economists part company with the ominous pictures of an overpopulated, starving world, prostrate before the throne of &#8216;competition,&#8217; &#8216;individual initiative,&#8217; &#8216;private property,&#8217; or some other pseudo-god, and tell men in simple, straightforward language how they may combine, re-shape, or overcome the laws and utilize them as a blessing instead of enduring them as a burden and a curse.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Much as Karl Marx drew radical implications from the ideas of the conservative Hegel, Nearing took the economic logic of his department head, Simon Patten, and made radical inferences about wealth and the distribution of income that his mentor had himself hesitated to draw.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n17\">[17]</a></sup> He believed that unfettered wealth stifled initiative and impeded economic advancement, and hoped that progressive thinkers among the ownership class itself would come to realize the negative impact of economic parasitism and accept their civic duty of enlightened leadership.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n18\">[18]</a></sup> Nearing instead outlined an economic republicanism based upon &#8220;four basic democratic concepts &#8211; equality of opportunity, civic obligation, popular government, and human rights.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n19\">[19]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearing&#8217;s aggressive social activism in the classroom and through the printed word brought him into conflict with his own employers at the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Wharton School of Business, resulting in his dismissal and his emergence as a <em>cause célèbre</em> of the American radical movement for the next decade. On the morning of June 16, 1915, Nearing&#8217;s secretary telephoned him to report that a letter from the Provost had arrived, which noted that &#8220;as the term of your appointment as assistant professor of economics for 1914-1915 is about to expire, I am directed by the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to inform you that it will not be renewed.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n20\">[20]</a></sup> The Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania was heavily stacked with bankers, corporation lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives, and Nearing&#8217;s writing had not gone unnoticed.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n21\">[21]</a></sup> Nearing&#8217;s tenuous situation had been exacerbated by an open letter to <em>The North American</em> in which he challenged the right wing evangelist Billy Sunday to apply the Gospel to the conditions of industrial capitalism, including &#8220;the railroad interests... the traction company... the manufacturers... the vested interests.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n22\">[22]</a></sup> Reaction to Nearing&#8217;s dismissal from the academy was swift, with department head Patten and others issuing statements condemning the decision. Progressives in the Wharton School quickly compiled a summary of the facts of the case and sent it to 1500 newspapers, journals, and academics around the country.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n23\">[23]</a></sup> Even conservatives in the faculty were deeply troubled since, as one Wharton professor observed, &#8220;the moment Nearing went, any conservative statement became but the spoken word of a &#8216;kept&#8217; professor.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n24\">[24]</a></sup> Conversely, some radicals were satisfied for being validated in their belief of the conservative nature of the American academy. Socialist writer Upton Sinclair told Nearing in no uncertain terms in an open letter that &#8220;You do not belong in a university. You belong with us Socialists and free lances.... Instead of addressing small numbers of college boys, you will be able to address large audiences of men.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n25\">[25]</a></sup> Retrospectively called by one historian &#8220;the most famous breach of academic freedom&#8221; of the era,<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n26\">[26]</a></sup> the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s action had the effect of making Scott Nearing into a public figure and fueled a long-running discussion about the proper role and rights of the teacher.</p>\r\n<p>From the Fall of 1915, Scott Nearing was established as a radical &#8220;public man.&#8221; He joined the American Union Against Militarism in 1916 and delivered a series of speeches condemning the &#8220;Preparedness&#8221; campaign then being promoted by Woodrow Wilson and the nation&#8217;s political elite.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n27\">[27]</a></sup> He also remained a university professor, teaching Social Science at city-owned Toledo University from 1915 through 1917. The intense nationalistic feeling that swept the country now that America was embroiled at last in the war in Europe spelled the end of Nearing&#8217;s Toledo days, as he later recalled in his memoirs:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, asked me to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly and then said, &#8216;As you know, I am attorney for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution.&#8217; He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8216;Of Course,&#8217; I said quietly. &#8216;That is one of the symptoms of war fever. Those who tell the truth or try to tell the truth are among the first victims of any war.&#8217;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">Al hurried on, &#8216;You understand, there is nothing personal about this. You and I have worked together on the Forum and other projects with never a real disagreement, certainly never a fight.&#8217;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8216;That is true,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and I think our joint efforts have helped to make some real advances here in Toledo.&#8217;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8216;True,&#8217; said Al. &#8216;It is also true that I have enjoyed every minute of our cooperation.&#8217; Then he added: &#8216;At this point I guess we part company. I hope we part as friends, on two sides of the war barrier that separates us. Please remember that there is nothing personal about this,&#8217; he repeated. &#8216;I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere.&#8217; We shook hands and I never saw him again.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n28\">[28]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearing packed up his things and moved to New York City, where he became a founding member of the broad anti-war organization the People&#8217;s Council, the establishment of which took place at the so-called First American Conference for Peace and Democracy, held May 30-31, 1917. He assumed the chairmanship of that organization that fall.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n29\">[29]</a></sup> On July 1, 1917, Nearing joined the Socialist Party and began a new job, working for the next six years as a lecturer in Economics and Sociology at the Socialist Party&#8217;s Rand School of Social Science.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n30\">[30]</a></sup> He was a prolific public speaker during this time, estimating that he had given approximately 200 speeches a year during the war years.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n31\">[31]</a></sup> Nearing authored a series of pamphlets, published by the Rand School, one of which, <em>The Great Madness: A Victory for the American Plutocracy,</em> resulted in his indictment under the Espionage Act for alleged &#8220;obstruction to the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n32\">[32]</a></sup> This indictment came down in April of 1918, but it was not until February of 1919 &#8211; that is, several months after the war in Europe had actually ended &#8211; that the trial against Nearing and the Rand School actually commenced.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n33\">[33]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The prosecution attempted to show that Nearing, by writing against militarism, had illegally interfered with the ability of the United States government to recruit and conscript troops for its military activities in Europe. It spent its effort making Nearing admit that he had written and spoken against militarism and the war in Europe &#8211; which he was quite willing to do. But at the end of the trial, Nearing addressed the jury and made a key point:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The prosecution has not been able to show a single instance in which recruiting was obstructed. They have not been able to show a single instance in which insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal to duty was caused.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n34\">[34]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearing noted the evil implications of the government&#8217;s attempt to illegalize written dissent:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The only way to have intelligent public opinion is to have discussion, and the moment you check discussion you destroy democracy....</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The Constitution does not guarantee us only the right to be correct, we have a right to be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as I understand it, and under the Constitution, as I understand it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself...on public questions.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n35\">[35]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The judge in the case, Julius M. Mayer, dismissed the first two counts of the indictment, alleging conspiracy, without sending them to the jury. Following deliberation, the jury found Scott Nearing not guilty but the American Socialist Society guilty on the third and fourth counts of the indictment. On March 21, 1919, sentence was passed and the American Socialist Society was fined $3,000 (short of the maximum fine of $10,000),<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n36\">[36]</a></sup> a sum which was ultimately collected through small donations from Socialists, labor groups, and civil libertarians in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>The Socialist Party of America split in the summer of 1919, with a factionalized Communist movement leaving to forge an underground existence in the years after the Palmer Raids. A significant organized &#8220;left wing&#8221; inspired by the Communist International remained in the party through 1921. Scott Nearing does not seem to have participated in the factional politics of these years, although his sympathies may well have rested with the former Socialists now building the various Communist Parties. As an employee of the Socialist Party-affiliated Rand School of Social Science, Nearling remained in the Socialist Party until the end of 1923.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n37\">[37]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The dramatic decline of the size and strength of the Socialist Party in the first years of the 1920s took its toll on Nearing. The plummeting membership of the SPA &#8211; down below the 13,500 member mark for 1921 &#8211; stood in marked contrast to the new and rapidly-growing &#8220;Legal Political Party&#8221; of the Communists, the Workers Party of America (WPA), which passed the Socialist Party in size after only a few months of existence in 1922.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n38\">[38]</a></sup> Nearing searched his soul in a lecture delivered in January 1923 at the Rand School, later published in the Socialist press, posing the question &#8220;What Can the Radical Do?&#8221; Nearing argued that the function of the radical was not administrative, but that of external critic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The Communist radical of today will be the administrator of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be the business of the radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function as a part of the established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n39\">[39]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>It was the radical&#8217;s additional function to get in touch with like-minded people in the unions, cooperatives, and in the sphere of political propaganda, Nearing added. In the unions, it was the Communist Party&#8217;s Trade Union Educational League that was currently &#8220;the liveliest thing in the trade unionism of the Middle West,&#8221; attempting at &#8220;boring from within&#8221; to radicalize the American Federation of Labor. Outside the AF of L, on the &#8220;extreme left&#8221; was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempting to found revolutionary industrial unions. Cooperators were, by the nature of their task, localized and conservative in their makeup, in Nearing&#8217;s view. Publishing was in disarray, with Charles H. Kerr  &amp;  Co. disorganized by wartime repression and the nature of the economics of publishing such that the production of low cost books a veritable impossibility. With regards to political action, Nearing produced concrete figures to show that since 1912, membership in the Socialist Party had &#8220;steadily declined.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n40\">[40]</a></sup> Nearing drew an explosive conclusion from this situation:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;That means, if it means anything, that in the United States as it is at present organized, the radical political movements are short-lived. And if that is true, then the Socialist Party has had its day. Through the Middle West recently I found the Socialist Party almost extinct. Since 1920 it has had first the Communist Party and then the Workers Party as rivals....</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The Workers Party has fallen heir to the present radical political situation in the United States. Is it build to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the Workers Party is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the Workers Party is weak; Moscow can dominate without any trouble.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n41\">[41]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Despite these misgivings, the potential of the growing organization appealed to Nearing over the malaise of the fading organization. Nearing finally applied for membership in the WPA in December of 1924; he was, however, initially rejected from membership, living for the next two years as a non-party fellow traveler of the organization. He finally gained admission to the Workers (Communist) Party only in 1927. Nearing went to work on the staff of the CP&#8217;s daily newspaper, <em>The Daily Worker,</em> on May 9, 1928, remaining in that position until resigning in January 1930 to publish a study on imperialism which failed to meet the ideological scrutiny of the organization. According to at least one historian, Nearing was formally expelled from the CPUSA in 1930 in connection with this decision.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n42\">[42]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In 1925, Nearing spent two months in the Soviet Union visiting schools and talking with educational authorities. &#8220;It was a fascinating experience to visit this important educational laboratory in its opening experimental stages,&#8221; he later recalled, noting that theories were then being actively tested with regards to subject matter, method of instruction, and social organization of students and teachers alike.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n43\">[43]</a></sup> The result of this visit was one of the first serious studies of the nascent Soviet educational system, a book entitled <em>Education in Soviet Russia.</em></p>\r\n<p>In 1927, Nearing made his first trip to Asia, traveling to China by ship for a three month stay. En route, the Kuomintang Party split, with forces loyal to Chiang Kai Shek attacking and summarily executing their former Communist allies. As Nearing later recalled</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Leftists were liquidated on sight. The procedure was summary. When one was captured by Chiang&#8217;s forces, his arms were held by two Chiang soldiers while a third, with a sword, hacked off his head. The remains were left lying as a warning to other Leftists to follow Chiang or perish. I saw some heads mounted on poles.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n44\">[44]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>While there Nearing rather boldly gave a speech at Yenching University on his book, <em>The American Empire,</em> in a room darkened so that audience members could not be later identified and denounced. Upon his return to the United States, Nearing authoring a book offering his views on the Chinese situation, entitled <em>Whither China?</em></p>\r\n<p>Nearing remained a prominent figure of the American Left throughout the decade of the 1920s, producing a seemingly ceaseless series of pamphlets on various radical political themes. He was also engaged professionally on the lecture circuit, making use of an agent to arrange speaking tours for about 20 years. These speaking tours continued into the early 1930s, by which time public interest in attending live speeches and debates on political themes had waned and ill health forced Nearing&#8217;s agent into retirement.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n45\">[45]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the Nearings moved to Winhall in rural Vermont, where they had purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate sized farm for $2500. The family lived there until the coming of the Korean War in 1950. Nearing lived an ascetic and largely self-reliant life, growing much of his own food and putting up nine stone buildings over the course of his two decades there.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n46\">[46]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Feeling a sense of dignity in the common man, and wanting to serve, Nearing wrote and self-published many pamphlets on topics such as low income, peace throughout the world, feminism, and different environmental causes.</p>\r\n<p>Nearing was the father of John Scott, who wrote a participant&#8217;s account of having worked in industry in the Soviet Union during the 1930s.</p>\r\n<p>A consistent pacifist, Nearing opposed American participation in World War II throughout the conflict. In 1943 he was fired by the Federated Press for his anti-war position, which Managing Editor Carl Haessler criticized as &#8220;childish.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n47\">[47]</a></sup>. Nearing was particularly shocked by the nuclear bombing of Japan, writing to President Harry S. Truman on August 6, 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, that &#8220;your government is no longer mine.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In 1954 he co-authored <em>Living the Good Life: How to Live Simply and Sanely in a Troubled World</em> with his wife Helen. The book, in which war, famine, and poverty were discussed, described a nineteen-year &#8220;back to the land experiment,&#8221; and also advocated a modern day &#8220;homesteading.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In the winter of 1956-57, Scott and Helen Nearing toured Canada, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, generating a book about their experiences called <em>Socialists Around the World.</em> The following winter, with their passports issued in 1956 nearing expiration, Scott and Helen Nearing embarked upon a trip through the Soviet Union and the People&#8217;s Republic of China. They returned home to Maine to write a book of their experiences, entitled <em>The Brave New World.</em> The pair visited Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, Baku, Taskent, and Irkutsk, touring schools and universities, apartment buildings in the process of construction, factories, and collective farms in the course of their trip. In China they saw Peking (Beijing), Wuhan and Nanking.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n48\">[48]</a></sup> The two countries were characterized in the Nearings&#8217; travelogue as &#8220;peaceful socialist giants&#8221;:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;The pro-peace attitude of the people of the Soviet Union and People&#8217;s China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. &#8216;We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialst society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation.&#8217;&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n49\">[49]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>In the wake of their travels to the USSR and China, Scott Nearing seems to have drawn somewhat closer once again to the Communist Party, whose official publishing house, New Century Publishers, produced Nearing pamphlets on Eastern Europe and Cuba in 1962 and 1963.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n50\">[50]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>As the Vietnam War took center stage in the mid-1960s, and as a large back-to-the-land movement developed in the U.S., a renewed interest in Nearing&#8217;s work and ideas occurred. Hundreds of anti-war believers flocked to Nearing&#8217;s home in Maine to learn homesteading practical-living skills, some also to hear a master radical&#8217;s anti-war message.</p>\r\n<p>In 1973, the University of Pennsylvania formally reversed its dismissal of Nearing in 1915 by awarding him the title of Honorary Emeritus Professor of Economics.</p>\r\n<p>Nearing appears in the film <em>Reds</em> (1981), as one of the many documentary &#8220;witnesses,&#8221; telling stories of his friend John Reed and of the heady days leading up to the Russian Revolution.</p>\r\n<p>Scott Nearing died on August 24, 1983, just eighteen days after his 100th birthday.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to working variously as a teacher, paid public speaker, and author, throughout his life Scott Nearing was a regular contributor of commentary on foreign affairs. As an octogenarian summing up his life, Nearing recalled</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;I have spent 70 years of study and travel in order to equip myself with information that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them. Since I do not speak with political authority I have no means of communicating my conclusions except by putting them in print myself and distributing them n the most advantageous way that is available to a private citizen.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n51\">[51]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Through the years, these foreign affairs writings made use of several different channels of distribution. In 1921 Nearing was, along with his colleague Louis Lochner, a co-founder of a forerunner of the Federated Press, a news service which sent out domestic and international news releases and picture mats five days a week to the labor and radical press in America. Nearing remained a regular contributor to the Federated Press (controlled by the Communist Party for most of its existence) until 1943, when he was fired for his anti-war position, which Federated Press editor Carl Haessler characterized as &#8220;childish.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n52\">[52]</a></sup> Nearing then began to contribute to an obscure monthly newsletter from Florida, <em>World Events.</em></p>\r\n<p>Shortly after its founding in 1949, Nearing began contributing a monthly &#8220;World Events&#8221; column to the independent theoretical monthly, Monthly Review, established by dissident Marxist economists Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman. Nearing tellingly characterized the objective of this publication as &#8220;the dissemination of a true understanding of society and the reporting of dependable news of the movement toward a socialist society which is steadily spreading over the face of the globe.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n53\">[53]</a></sup> Through the decades, Nearing wrote thousands of pages of news and commentary on these themes, retiring from this activity only in 1970, at the age of 87.</p>\r\n<p>During his 1919 trial for allegedly obstructing American military recruitment during World War I, at which he testified in his own defense, the prosecution asked Scott Nearing whether he was a &#8220;pacifist socialist.&#8221; Nearing&#8217;s reply was illuminating &#8211; he replied that he was a &#8220;pacifist&#8221; and left it at that. Prosecutor Earl B. Barnes was taken aback and asked for clarification:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">Q: You are a pacifist even to class struggles?<br />\r\n[Nearing]: I am a pacifist in that I believe that no man has a right to do violence to any other man.<br />\r\nQ: Even in the class struggle?<br />\r\n[Nearing]: Under no circumstances.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n54\">[54]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Half a century later, writing in his 1972 autobiography, <em>The Making of a Radical</em>, Scott Nearing described himself as a pacifist, a socialist, and a vegetarian. In his autobiography he says &#8220;I became a vegetarian because I was persuaded that life is as valid for other creatures as it is for humans. I do not need dead animal bodies to keep me alive, strong and healthy. Therefore, I will not kill for food.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n55\">[55]</a></sup> Nearing listed his four most influential teachers as Leo Tolstoy, Simon Nelson Patten, his grandfather and mother. Other influences he acknowledged in his memoirs included Socrates, Gautama Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahatma Gandhi, Jesus, Confucius, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Otis Whitman, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Victor Hugo, Edward Bellamy, Olive Schreiner, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Romain Rolland&#8217;s <em>Jean-Christophe</em>.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n56\">[56]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Scott Nearing&#8217;s journey over a century was neatly (albeit perhaps facilely) described by one biographer as follows:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Nearing&#8217;s intellectual development followed a path of increasing awareness of the intransigence of the dominant classes of capitalist culture to adopt reforms that would spread the enlightenment and opportunities of the leisure classes to society as a whole. From the time of his firing from the University of Pennsylvania in 1915 through the aftermath of World War I, he experienced the limits of permissible questioning of conventional wisdom. His long, difficult journey from an orthodox reformer of the ruling class from within to a complete secessionist from capitalist cultural hegemony led him by 1932 to choose homesteading &#8211; an experiment Nearing called &#8216;living the good life.&#8217;</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;In that spirit, Nearing moved through a series of secessions &#8211; from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the wilderness as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing&#8217;s perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;In his devotion to conscientious self-reliance, Nearing emerged as a twentieth-century colleague of Emerson and Thoreau.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n57\">[57]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>This view, that Nearing chose to &#8220;drop out&#8221; of politics and society itself and live life as a rugged agrarian individualist at one with nature, is a common interpretation &#8211; and certainly one with some merit. Another possible reading of Nearing&#8217;s motivations and decision-making lies in his own writing. Nearing repeatedly drew inspiration from the life story of Count Leo Tolstoi, whose life Nearing clearly saw as analogous to his own:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Count Leo Tolstoi is a classic example of an individual in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist social pattern and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point until the day he left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n58\">[58]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>The tension between the dissident individual and the group was an unenviable one, Nearing believed. In the conflict between the solitary individual and the community, Nearing saw only three possible outcomes:</p>\r\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;(1) The individual may win out and impose himself and his ideas upon the group. The normal consequence of such an outcome is a personal dictatorship or the imposition upon the community of an oligarchy in which the dissident individual or individuals play a prominent role. (2) The division of the community into factions, one of which upholds the dissident individual, with a stalemate leading to feuding, rebellion, civil war. (3) The group wins out, imposes its will and eliminates the non-conformist. Such conflict sequences have occurred repeatedly in contemporary and in earlier history.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n59\">[59]</a></sup></p>\r\n<p>Nearing&#8217;s chosen lifestyle of &#8220;Tolstoian,&#8221; ascetic, rural self-sufficiency may be reasonably interpreted as the attempt of a self-aware dissident individual to avoid inevitably negative participation in the internal life of the group (be it government or political party), while retaining a keen and almost obsessive interest in the dynamics of society and the world as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>Allen Ginsberg, the Beat Generation poet, referred to Nearing as a &#8220;grand old man, a real mensch&#8221; in his poem <em>America.</em></p>\r\n<h5>Footnotes</h5>\r\n<p class=\"information\"><a name=\"n1\"><span class=\"info\">1.</span></a> John A.

While those who had gone before him in the sciences of mathematics, optics, astronomy, mechanics, etc., had collected numerous observations and developed some crucial concepts, in the space of a single life-time (without getting into the dispute about share of credit due to Newton or Leibniz) Newton took some scattered observations and insights and built a theoretical system which brought within the scope of a single, rational, mathematical theory virtually <em>all</em> phenomena of the Universe. Most notably he brought within the scope of a single concept the force which caused the Heavenly Bodies to &quot;fall&quot; across the sky and the common-or-garden objects which we perceive and handle in our daily lives here on Earth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe discovery of the branch of mathematics known as Calculus, which Newton helped build as did Leibniz, provided a tool of enormous power for the formulation of a mathematical view of Nature. The peculiarity of calculus is that it's supposed derivation from lower mathematics is not (at least until very recent times) reducable to the constraints of formal logic. So while providing future generations with a wonderfully simple and comprehensive mechanical view of Nature, he also introduced a fundamental and irreducible contradiction into mathematics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe enormous power of this view of the world has to be taken account of. Those who came after him must have felt there was little left to be done but tidy up the edges. The blow dealt to religion and the impetus given to the development of science and industry is gigantic, despite the fact that Newton remained a devout Christian to his dying day. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, in the political struggles of his day, Newton was the Devil incarnate or the source of all light, respective of one's political position. His view of scientific method, space and time, knowledge, God and truth was a dominant force throughout the nineteenth century. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/newton.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../n.htm\">Index of the Letter N</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"

Stiritz Distinguished Professor in Women's Studies and History, both in Arts &amp; Sciences, decided it was time for a major change. So after 25 years at the State University of New York-Albany, she came to Washington University. \nNicholson first became interested in feminism in the late 1960s, but it wasn't until 1975 that she became fully immersed in feminism as an area of academic research. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania, and a master's and a doctorate in the history of ideas program at Brandeis University. </p>\n<p>\nAfter Brandeis, Nicholson taught for a year at the University of Lancaster in northern England. She then returned to the United States to teach at SUNY-Albany.</p>\n<p>\nShe received a residential fellowship at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at Harvard University's Divinity School in 1998. The previous year she received the Bread and Roses Award from the University of Albany for outstanding service on behalf of women. She was National Endowment for the Humanities Visiting Scholar in June 1992 at the State University of New York, Potsdam, and the previous year she received a Rockefeller Foundation Humanist in Residence Fellowship at the Center for Research on Women at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. </p>\n<p>\nHer first book was <i>Gender and History: The Limits of Social Theory in the Age of the Family</i>. In it, Nicholson argues that in the history of Western political philosophy, there had been a significant problem: Some of the major contributors to that history had not recognized that the relationship between private and public life was a historically changing relationship. </p>\n<p>\nThey took the existing form of that relationship, the form found in their own societies, and assumed it was natural. </p>\n<p>\nAlso while at Albany, Nicholson developed and edited the 32-volume series <i>Thinking Gender</i>, which is often credited with shaping the emerging discipline feminism as a political philosophy. In her career, she has written two books and more than 70 articles and reviews. </p>\n \n\n"

        "image": "pics/nietzsch.jpg",
        "content": "\nGerman philosopher, proponent of <a href=\"../../terms/v/o.htm#voluntarism\">Voluntarism</a>, a founder of modern irrationalism and an early <a href=\"../../terms/e/x.htm#existentialism\">Existentialist</a>. Nietzsche sought to unmask the root motives that underlie traditional Western religion, morality, and philosophy, and exerted considerable influence over all aspects of culture in the twentieth century. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche was born in R&ouml;cken, a village in Prussian Saxony. His home was a stronghold of Lutheran piety. His paternal grandfather had published books defending Protestantism and had achieved the ecclesiastical position of superintendent; his maternal grandfather was a country parson; his father, Carl Ludwig Nietzsche, was appointed pastor at R&ouml;cken by order of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. His father died in 1849, before Nietzsche's fifth birthday, and he spent most of his early life in a household consisting of five women: his mother Franziska, his younger sister Elisabeth, his maternal grandmother, and two maiden aunts. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1850 the family moved to Naumburg on the Saale River, where Nietzsche attended a private preparatory school. In 1858 he earned a scholarship to Schulpforta, Germany's leading Protestant boarding school where he received an outstanding classical education, and, having graduated in 1864, went to the University of Bonn to study theology and classical philology. Despite efforts to take part in the university's social life, the two semesters at Bonn were a failure, owing chiefly to acrimonious quarrels between his two leading classics professors, Otto Jahn and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl. Nietzsche sought refuge in music, writing a number of compositions strongly influenced by Robert Schumann, the German Romantic composer. In 1865 he transferred to the University of Leipzig, joining Ritschl, who had accepted an appointment there. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche began military service in 1867, where he sustained an injury, and resumed his studies in Leipzig in 1868. During the years in Leipzig, Nietzsche discovered <a href=\"../../people/s/c.htm#schopenhauer-arthur\">Arthur Schopenhauer's</a> philosophy, met Richard Wagner, and began his lifelong friendship with Erwin Rohde. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1869 the University of Leipzig conferred a PhD on Nietzsche without dissertation, on the strength of his published writings, and the University of Basel appointed him extraordinary professor of classical philosophy. The following year Nietzsche became a Swiss citizen and was promoted to ordinary professor. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche, after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, obtained leave to serve as a volunteer medical orderly in August 1870. Within a month, he contracted dysentery and diphtheria, which ruined his health permanently. He returned to Basel to resume teaching, but ill health persecuted him. </p>\n<p>\nDuring these early Basel years Nietzsche's ambivalent friendship with Wagner ripened, but Wagner's increasing exploitation of Christian motifs, as in <span class=\"book\">Parsifal</span>, coupled with his chauvinism and anti-Semitism proved to be more than Nietzsche could bear. By 1878 the breach between the two men had become final. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche's first book, <span class=\"book\">The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music</span> (1872), argued that Greek tragedy arose out of the fusion of what he termed Apollonian and Dionysian elements and that Socratic rationalism and optimism spelled the death of Greek tragedy. Greeted by stony silence at first, it became the object of heated controversy. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1877 he set up house with his sister and Peter Gast, and in 1878 his aphoristic <span class=\"book\">Human, All-Too-Human</span> appeared. Seriously ill, half-blind, in virtually unrelenting pain, he lived in boarding houses in Switzerland, the French Riviera, and Italy, with only limited human contact. His friendship with Paul R&eacute;e was undermined by 1882 by their mutual affection for Lou Salom&eacute;; (mistress of Rainer Maria Rilke, and confidant of <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Sigmund Freud</a>) as well as by his sister Elisabeth's jealousy. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche's <span class=\"book\">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</span>, was published between 1883 and 1885, partly at his own expense and received little attention. His attempts to set forth his philosophy in more direct prose, in the publications in 1886 of <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Beyond Good and Evil</span></a> and in 1887 of <span class=\"book\">On the Genealogy of Morals</span>, also failed to win a wide audience. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche's final lucid year, 1888, was a period of supreme productivity, publishing many works, including <span class=\"book\">Ecce Homo</span>, a reflection on his own works and significance. <span class=\"book\">Twilight of the Idols</span> appeared in 1889, <span class=\"book\">The Anti-Christ</span> and <span class=\"book\">Nietzsche against Wagner</span> were not published until 1895, the former mistaken as book 1 of <span class=\"book\">The Will to Power</span>. <span class=\"book\">Ecce Homo</span> was withheld from publication until 1908. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche collapsed in the streets of Turin, Italy, in January 1889, having lost control of his mental faculties completely. Bizarre but meaningful notes he sent immediately after his collapse brought Franz Overbeck to Italy to return Nietzsche to Basel. Nietzsche spent the last 11 years of his life in total mental darkness, first in a Basel asylum, then in Naumburg under his mother's care and, after her death in 1897, in Weimar in his sister's care. He died on Aug. 25, 1900 of general paralysis caused by syphilis. </p>\n<p>\nThe association of Nietzsche's name with Fascism owes much to the use made of his works by his sister Elisabeth, married to a leading anti-Semite, Bernhard F&ouml;rster. Elisabeth maintained ruthless control over Nietzsche's literary estate, produced collections of his &quot;works&quot; consisting of discarded notes, such as <span class=\"book\">The Will to Power</span> (1901), and even committed petty forgeries. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche's writings fall into three well-defined periods. The early works are dominated by a Romantic perspective influenced by Schopenhauer and Wagner. The middle period, reflects the tradition of French aphorists, extoling reason and science, experiments with literary genres, and expresses Nietzsche's emancipation from his earlier Romanticism and from Schopenhauer and Wagner. In his mature writings Nietzsche was preoccupied by the origin and function of values in human life. He was especially interested, in analysing the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he saw as expressions of the ascetic ideal. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche held that common to traditional religion and philosophy was the unstated but powerful motivating assumption that existence requires explanation, justification, or expiation. Both denigrated experience in favour of some other, &quot;true&quot; world. </p>\n<p>\nNietzsche's critique of traditional morality centred on the typology of &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; morality. By examining the etymology of the German words <em>gut</em> (good), <em>schlecht</em> (bad), and <em>b&ouml;se</em> (evil), Nietzsche maintained that the distinction between good and bad was a non-moral reference to those who were privileged, the masters, as opposed to those who were base, the slaves. </p>\n<p>\nThe history of 20th-century philosophy, theology, and psychology are unintelligible without Nietzsche. The German philosophers Scheler, <a href=\"../../people/j/a.htm#jaspers-karl\">Jaspers</a> and <a href=\"../../people/h/e.htm#heidegger-martin\">Heidegger</a>, the French philosophers Camus, <a href=\"../../people/d/e.htm#derrida-jacques\">Derrida</a> and <a href=\"../../people/f/o.htm#foucault-michel\">Foucault</a> owe much to Nietzsche. The psychologists Adler and <a href=\"../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl\">Jung</a> were deeply influenced, as was <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Freud</a>; novelists like Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Andr&eacute; Malraux, Andr&eacute; Gide, the poets and playwrights George Bernard Shaw, Rainer Maria Rilke, Stefan George, and William Butler Yeats, among others. Nietzsche is certainly one of the most influential philosophers who ever lived; and this is due not only to his originality but also to the fact that he was one of the German language's most brilliant prose writers.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> See the <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/nietzsche/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Nietzsche Reference Archive</span></a>.<br />\n<em>Off-site Links:</em> <a href=\"http://www.cwu.edu/~millerj/nietzsche/index.html\">Pirate Nietzsche page</a>\n</p>\n\n\n\n"

Trained as a teacher, he went to the United States in 1935 for advanced studies and continued his schooling in England, where he helped organize the Pan-African Congress in 1945. He returned to Ghana in 1947 and became general secretary of the newly founded United Gold Coast Convention but split from it in 1949 to form the Convention People's party (CPP).</p>\n<p>\nAfter his 'positive action' campaign created disturbances in 1950, Nkrumah was jailed, but when the CPP swept the 1951 elections, he was freed to form a government, and he led the colony to independence as Ghana in 1957. A firm believer in African liberation, Nkrumah pursued a radical pan-African policy, playing a key role in the formation of the Organization of African Unity in 1963. As head of government, he was less successful however, and as time passed he was accused of forming a dictatorship. In 1964 he formed a one-party state, with himself as president for life, and was accused of actively promoting a cult of his own personality. Overthrown by the military in 1966, with the help of western backing, he spent his last years in exile, dying in Bucharest, Romania, on April 27, 1972. His legacy and dream of a \"United States of African\" still remains a goal among many.</p>\n<p>\nNkrumah was the motivating force behind the movement for independence of Ghana, then British West Africa, and its first president when it became independent in 1957.

Born in New York, he returned there in 1962 to devote himself to a career as a folksinger, recording his first album, &#8220;All the News That&#8217;s Fit to Sing,&#8221; in 1964. His three topical albums (including &#8220;I Ain&#8217;t Marching Anymore&#8221; (1965) and &#8220;Phil Ochs in Concert&#8221; (1966) covered issues large and small, from the woes of the journalist William Worthy after his visit to Cuba (&#8220;The Ballad of William Worthy&#8221;) to the US invasion of the Dominican Republic (&#8220;The Marines Have Landed on the Shores of Santo Domingo) and the horrors of the segregationist south (&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the State of Mississippi&#8221;). </p>\n<p>In 1967 he left New York and Elektra Records and moved to California and A &amp; M records. These moves were significant in many ways, as he left behind the political and musical world that he had been part of for a far different milieu, and the differences are reflected in his subsequent albums. In his first A &amp; M album, &#8220;Pleasures of the Harbor&#8221; the guitar strumming folkie is replaced with a tenor backed by huge orchestrated productions, and the biting political lyrics were replaced with long, flowing poetic pieces. This was to be the most controversial period of his artistic career, and even though he continued to sing the occasional political song (&#8220;White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land,&#8221; &#8220;The War is Over&#8221;) he had clearly &#8211; musically at least &#8211; left behind his political roots and returned to those he had kept hidden until then, those in the music of Buddy Holly and Faron Young. </p>\n<p>Despite the musical turnabout he never really abandoned his politics, participating in the demonstrations in Chicago in 1968, testifying at the trial of the Chicago Eight, and later organizing a Chile benefit concert. But his adoption of gold lamé suits and a rock-and-roll persona led to stormy results at his concerts in the early seventies, best summed up by the title of an album never released in the US, &#8220;Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.&#8221; There are many explanations of his musical change, but not the least of them was his depression over and disgust with American politics, which he feared had taken a fascist turn, all of which he clearly expressed in interviews at the time. Perhaps as much as anything, though, it was a misguided attempt to reach a new audience.</p>\n<p>Already all but abandoned by his former fans, his final descent towards death began with his being attacked on a beach in Tanzania, causing damage to his vocal chords. He was throwing away money he didn&#8217;t have, drinking heavily, and in his psychosis developed a new persona, that of John Train. He finally found himself living at his sister Sonny&#8217;s house in the Far Rockaway section of Queens, where he committed suicide on April 9, 1976.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/ochs/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Phil Ochs Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../o.htm\">Index of the Letter O</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

Three years later he escaped and went to live in Paris. </p>\n<p>\nIn April, 1912, Ordzhonikidze and Joseph Stalin returned to St Petersburg.

Sent back to England to be educated at the elite public school Eton, the young Blair initially looked set to follow in his father&#8217;s footsteps, and in 1922 joined up with the Indian Imperial Police stationed in Burma. </p>\n<p>However, the young Blair had already developed a healthy suspicion of the ruling class and illegitimate authority while at Eton, and after five years of work assisting in what he later called &#8216;tyranny and exploitation&#8217; in Burma, returned to Britain a convinced anti-Imperialist. Amid the Great Depression, &#8216;George Orwell&#8217; the novelist was born, making his mark with documentary accounts of the poverty and suffering of working class people such as <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em> (1933) and <em>The Road to Wigan Pier</em> (1937). </p>\n<p>In late 1936, Orwell&#8217;s hatred of Fascism coupled with his military training saw him volunteer to fight to defend the Spanish Republic from General Franco&#8217;s attempted coup. Yet in working class Barcelona, he saw not civil war, but the aftermath of a popular revolutionary upheaval, and signed up with the POUM militia, which itself openly declared itself for socialist revolution. While fighting fascists (and taking a bullet in the throat for his troubles), Orwell could only watch in despair as Stalinism, by then a counter-revolutionary force, contributed to the defeat of democracy. Orwell returned from Spain a changed man, vividly describing his experience of worker&#8217;s power in <em>Homage to Catalonia </em>(1938). In &#8216;<a href=\"../../../archive/orwell/1946/why-i-write.htm\">Why I Write</a>&#8217; (1946), he declared &#8216;every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, <em>against</em> totalitarianism and <em>for</em> democratic Socialism.&#8217; </p>\n<p>While he briefly joined the Independent Labour Party, took Trotskyism and anarchism seriously, and always longed for a revolution in Britain, the literary anti-Stalinist classics <em>Animal Farm</em> and <em>1984</em>, which made his name, were marked by a profound pessimism. While always a contradictory and unpredictable writer, his early death in 1950 sadly robbed Orwell of the chance to put up a better fight than he had done up to that point against the numerous reactionary apologists for the rich and powerful, who were trying, as they still try today, to claim him as one of their own. </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/orwell/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">George Orwell Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../o.htm\">Index of the Letter O</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

He was the founder of infant schools, and introduced\nthem first at New Lanark. At the age of two, the children came to\nschool, where they enjoyed themselves so much that they could scarely be\ngot home again. Whilst his competitors worked their people 13 or 14\nhours a day, in New Lanark the working-day was only 10 and a half hours.\nWhen a crisis in cotton stopped work for four months, his workers\nreceived their full wages all the time. And with all this the business\nmore than doubled in value, and to the last yielded large profits to its\nproprietors.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\nIn spite of all this, Owen was not content. The existence which he\nsecured for his workers was, in his eyes, still far from being worthy of\nhuman beings. \"The people were slaves at my mercy.\" The relatively\nfavorable conditions in which he had placed them were still far from\nallowing a rational development of the character and of the intellect in\nall directions, much less of the free exercise of all their faculties.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quotec\">\n \"And yet, the working part of this population of 2,500 persons was\n daily producing as much real wealth for society as, less than half\n a century before, it would have required the working part of a\n population of 600,000 to create. I asked myself, what became of\n the difference between the wealth consumed by 2,500 persons and\n that which would have been consumed by 600,000?\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nThe answer was clear. It had been used to pay the proprietors of the\nestablishment 5 per cent on the capital they had laid out, in addition\nto over 300,000 pounds clear profit. And that which held for New Lanark\nheld to a still greater extent for all the factories in England.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quotec\">\n \"If this new wealth had not been created by machinery, imperfectly\n as it has been applied, the wars of Europe, in opposition to\n Napoleon, and to support the aristocratic principles of society,\n could not have been maintained. And yet this new power was the\n creation of the working-classes.\"\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nTo them, therefore, the fruits of this new power belonged. The\nnewly-created gigantic productive forces, hitherto used only to enrich\nindividuals and to enslave the masses, offered to Owen the foundations\nfor a reconstruction of society; they were destined, as the common\nproperty of all, to be worked for the common good of all.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nOwen's communism was based upon this purely business foundation, the\noutcome, so to say, of commercial calculation. Throughout, it\nmaintained this practical character. Thus, in 1823, Owen proposed the\nrelief of the distress in Ireland by Communist colonies, and drew up\ncomplete estimates of costs of founding them, yearly expenditure, and\nprobably revenue. And in his definite plan for the future, the\ntechnical working out of details is managed with such practical\nknowledge -- ground plan, front and side and bird's-eye views all\nincluded -- that the Owen method of social reform once accepted, there\nis from the practical point of view little to be said against the actual\narrangement of details.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nHis advance in the direction of Communism was the turning-point in\nOwen's life. As long as he was simply a philanthropist, he was rewarded\nwith nothing but wealth, applause, honor, and glory. He was the most\npopular man in Europe. Not only men of his own class, but statesmen and\nprince listened to him approvingly. But when he came out with his\nCommunist theories that was quite another thing. Three great obstacles\nseemed to him especially to block the path to social reform:\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n private property,\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n religion,\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n the present form of marriage.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nHe knew what confronted him if he attacked these -- outlawry,\nexcommunication from official society, the loss of his whole social\nposition. But nothing of this prevented him from attacking them without\nfear of consequences, and what he had foreseen happened. Banished from\nofficial society, with a conspiracy of silence against him in the press,\nruined by his unsuccessful Communist experiments in America, in which he\nsacrificed all his fortune, he turned directly to the working-class and\ncontinued working in their midst for 30 years. Every social movement,\nevery real advance in England on behalf of the workers links itself on\nto the name of Robert Owen. He forced through in 1819, after five\nyears' fighting, the first law limiting the hours of labor of women and\nchildren in factories. He was president of the first Congress at which\nall the Trade Unions of England united in a single great trade\nassociation. He introduced as transition measures to the complete\ncommunistic organization of society, on the one hand, cooperative\nsocieties for retail trade and production. These have since that time,\nat least, given practical proof that the merchant and the manufacturer\nare socially quite unnecessary. On the other hand, he introduced labor\nbazaars for the exchange of the products of labor through the medium of\nlabor-notes, whose unit was a single hour of work; institutions\nnecessarily doomed to failure, but completely anticipating Proudhon's\nbank of exchange of a much later period, and differing entirely from\nthis in that it did not claim to be the panacea for all social ills, but\nonly a first step towards a much more radical revolution of society.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nThe Utopians' mode of thought has for a long time governed the Socialist\nideas of the 19th century, and still governs some of them. Until very\nrecently, all French and English Socialists did homage to it. The\nearlier German Communism, including that of Weitling, was of the same\nschool. To all these, Socialism is the expression of absolute truth,\nreason and justice, and has only to be discovered to conquer all the\nworld by virtue of its own power. And as an absolute truth is\nindependent of time, space, and of the historical development of man, it\nis a mere accident when and where it is discovered. With all this,\nabsolute truth, reason, and justice are different with the founder of\neach different school. And as each one's special kind of absolute\ntruth, reason, and justice is again conditioned by his subjective\nunderstanding, his conditions of existence, the measure of his knowledge\nand his intellectual training, there is no other ending possible in this\nconflict of absolute truths than that they shall be mutually exclusive\nof one another. Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind of\neclectic, average Socialism, which, as a matter of fact, has up to the\npresent time dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in\nFrance and England. Hence, a mish-mash allowing of the most manifold\nshades of opinion: a mish-mash of such critical statements, economic\ntheories, pictures of future society by the founders of different sects,\nas excite a minimum of opposition; a mish-mash which is the more easily\nbrewed the more definite sharp edges of the individual constituents are\nrubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">\nTo make a science of Socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real\nbasis.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/economics/owen/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Robert Owen Archive</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../o.htm\">Index of the Letter O</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

After leaving school, Nurse went into journalism before leaving Trinidad to study law at university in the United States. Yet instead of returning home to become a respected professional among the small black middle class of Trinidad, Nurse became a student radical and in 1927 joined the Communist Party of the USA, becoming &#8216;George Padmore&#8217; in the process. Padmore&#8217;s talents as an organiser and writer meant he was soon appointed head of the Communist International&#8217;s &#8216;Negro Bureau&#8217;, and from 1929 to 1933 he was a leading agitator for colonial revolution, travelling widely and residing for periods in Moscow, Hamburg, Vienna, London and Paris. As well as editing the <em>Negro Worker</em>, Padmore wrote prolifically, and his <em>The Life and Struggles of Negro Toilers</em> (1931) was particularly influential. </p>\r\n<p>However, when the rise of Hitler&#8217;s Nazis in Germany led the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations and seek new diplomatic and military ties with Britain and France, anti-colonialism was no longer the central issue it once was for the Communist International. Resigning from his positions in disgust, the anti-imperialist Padmore survived a vicious Stalinist witch-hunt, and in 1935 returned to Britain. Meeting up again with his boyhood friend from Trinidad, the then Trotskyist C.L.R. James, Padmore from his base in London now steadily evolved into arguably one of the twentieth century&#8217;s most important Pan-African figures. Though close to the Independent Labour Party in Britain, and writing prolifically for its publications, Padmore never formally joined, but continued to devote his energies to the struggle to liberate Africa from colonial rule. </p>\r\n<p>In 1937, Padmore formed the International African Service Bureau, later the Pan-African Federation and in 1945 was central to organising the legendary Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester. Besides writing several books from his London home, from <em>How Britain Rules Africa</em> (1936) to <em>Pan-Africanism or Communism?</em> (1956), Padmore&#8217;s greatest triumph undoubtedly came when one African disciple of his, Kwame Nkrumah, led the Gold Coast from British colonial rule to independence in 1957. Though Padmore&#8217;s experience working in Ghana as advisor to Nkrumah in the last years of his life was to be a rather disappointing one, that he lived to witness the birth of a black nation in Africa remains a vindication of, and a testament to, his life&#8217;s work. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/padmore/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">George Padmore Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Residing in Florence, he studied philosophy and politics and wrote many articles analysing economic problems with mathematical tools. In 1893 he was appointed to the chair of political economy at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPareto's first work, <span class=\"book\">Cours d'&Eacute;conomie Politique</span> (1896-97), included his famous but much-criticised law of income distribution, a complicated mathematical formulation in which Pareto attempted to prove that the distribution of incomes and wealth in society exhibits a consistent pattern throughout history, in all parts of the world and in all societies. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his <span class=\"book\">Manuale d'economia politica</span> (1906), he further developed his theory of pure economics and his analysis of ophelimity (power to give satisfaction). He laid the foundation of modern welfare economics with his concept of the so-called Pareto optimum, stating that the optimum allocation of the resources of a society is not attained so long as it is possible to make at least one individual better off in his own estimation while keeping others as well off as before in their own estimation. He also introduced &quot;curves of indifference,&quot; that did not become popular until the 1930s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nBelieving that there were problems that economics could not solve, Pareto turned to sociology, writing what he considered his greatest work, <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/it/pareto.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Mind and Society</span></a> (1916), in which he inquired into the nature and bases of individual and social action. Persons of superior ability, he argued, seek to confirm and aggrandise their social position. Thus social classes are formed. In an effort to rise into the elite of the upper strata, privileged members of the lower-class groups continually strive to use their abilities and thus improve them; the opposite tendency obtains among the elite. As a result, the best-equipped persons from the lower class rise to challenge the position of the upper-class elite. There thus occurs a &quot;circulation of elites.&quot; Because of his theory of the superiority of the elite, Pareto sometimes has been associated with fascism.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nFrench mathematician, physicist, philosopher, and Christian religious thinker.  Best known for his work on religious belief and mathematics, but also developed one of the first radical critiques of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> in France, and of the idea of a natural right to property.</p>\r\n<p>During his relatively brief life, Pascal published works on geometry, the physics of air pressure and vacuums (hydrostatics), and invented a mechanical calculator (the &#8220;pascaline&#8221;).  Following an intense, quasi-mystical experience in 1654, he became increasingly committed to the Jansenist theological movement centered at Port-Royal convent.  With his caustic <em>Provincial Letters</em> (1656-57), published under a pseudonym, he intervened on behalf of the Jansenists in the political and theological controversy with the Jesuits at the time.</p>\r\n<p>Most of Pascal&#8217;s work, however, including his magnum opus, the <em>Pensées</em> (&#8220;thoughts&#8221;), was not published until after his death.  The <em>Pensées</em> is a collection of notes, ostensibly for an <em>Apology for the Christian Religion</em>, but which contain reflections on a wide variety of subjects, including the nature and limits of reason and knowledge, the sources of belief and human motivation, the meaning of the human condition, and the role and relationship of justice and force in society.</p>\r\n<p>At the heart of Pascal&#8217;s social thought is the idea that often what is taken as natural is actually the result of custom and social conditioning.  So, in the <em>Pensées</em>, Pascal tries to show that there is a dialectic between true justice, which is always in dispute, and force, which is indisputable.  Being unable to &#8220;fortify justice,&#8221; we have &#8220;justified force&#8221; to ensure peace.  It is by the effect of imagination and habituation &#8211; of human psychology in certain social conditions and relations &#8211; that ideas legitimating the position of the powerful are (mis)taken for natural justice, thus stabilizing society.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, the <em><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/pascal/1630/three-discourses.htm\" target=\"_top\">Three Discourses on the Condition of the Great</a></em> (posthumous), demystifies the ideological foundations of feudalism by positing, before the Enlightenment and Rousseau, that all people are naturally equal; the difference between a king and a commoner is one of human establishment, not of any natural quality.  Hence, not only do absolute monarchy and noble privilege &#8211; the pillars of the <em>Ancien Régime</em> &#8211; have an imaginary foundation, so, too, do property rights.  Those who possess great riches and occupy a superior social position do so by a combination of institutionalized force, historical chance, and a kind of popular misunderstanding &#8211;  not by necessity, merit or natural right.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this radical critique, Pascal advises against revolution to achieve a more just social order.  Pascal&#8217;s reasoning here presents a key puzzle of his thought.  In his view of history, the dialectic between force and justice allows for no synthesis or progress, only cyclical conflict.  We do not have a clear enough view of true justice to establish it beyond dispute, so we should prefer peace and order, which we can establish.  Pascal&#8217;s experience with <em>la Fronde</em>, a series of ill-fated noble uprisings against royal power between 1648 and 1653, may also have contributed to this reticence.  </p>\r\n<p>Instead, Pascal counseled a kind of lucid submission to the existing social order, and its internal standard of justice.  Although consistent with a certain tradition of Christian political conservatism, Pascal&#8217;s position is more complex.  If one is to render outwardly onto established sovereigns (e.g., kings in monarchies, the majority in democracies) the respect that is fitting to that position, one is to refrain from seeing any natural superiority (or inferiority) in those of a different rank.  Furthermore, one is to recognize that there are higher &#8220;orders,&#8221; like those governing what merits esteem or belief, which it would be tyrannical to subordinate to the political order.</p>\r\n<p>This hybrid approach &#8211; radical critique with conservative prescription &#8211; offers a point of contrast with the revolutionary tradition.  But it also reflects the debate surrounding Marx&#8217;s own equivocal treatment of justice as, on one hand, the means by which modes of production judge themselves, but also, potentially, a criterion that could allow for their comparative evaluation (e.g., of why socialism or communism would be preferable to capitalism).</p>\r\n<p>Also of interest in the <em>Pensées</em>, is the famous &#8220;wager&#8221; argument for believing in God.  Rather than trying to prove the existence of God, like his contemporary Descartes, Pascal argues for the rationality or advantage of religious belief.  This distinction can be seen to presage Marx&#8217;s analysis of religion&#8217;s social function.  Also like Descartes, Pascal is a dualist, in that he separates mind and body, but, unlike Descartes, he emphasizes the inexorable role of the body in the formation of beliefs, embedded in social contexts, through habit and custom.  </p>\r\n<p>Pascal&#8217;s contemporary legacy is visible in diverse fields.  The &#8220;wager&#8221; has been the subject of much work in decision theory.  In the philosophy of science, Pierre Duhem, one of the founders of epistemological holism (the thesis that theories cannot be tested in isolation because they depend on other theories) draws especially from Pascal&#8217;s analysis of reasoning in <em>Of the Geometrical Mind</em> [<em>esprit</em>] (1658, but published posthumously).  And, in social theory, the critical sociologist Pierre Bourdieu invokes Pascal&#8217;s account of incorporated habits and symbolic power in the shaping of collective beliefs (see his <em>Méditations Pascaliennes</em>, 1997).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He continued his education abroad at the University of Munich, studying both law and political economy. In 1912 Pashukanis joined the Bolshevik party. In 1918 he served as a people's judge around Moscow, then worked as a legal adviser in the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the Russia Republic, and soon became a vice-commissar of Justice. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPashukanis's tour de force is his 1924 work <em>General Theory of Law and Marxism</em>, which brought him immediate international fame. The book was soon published in three editions and three languages (Russian, German, and Italian). Pashukanis was on the editorial boards of the major encyclopedias (Encyclopedia of State and Law) and law periodicals of the nation until 1930. He taught law and shaped the syllabi and text books of law teaching at Moscow University and the Institute of Red Professors of the Communist Academy. Pashukanis soon became the Director of the national Institute of State, Law, and Soviet Construction (it would be renamed several times).</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPashukanis's <em>General Theory of Law and Marxism</em> was banned in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist uprising of the 1930s, and would not be again published in the USSR until 1982 (though he was \"rehabilitated\" in 1956 by the RSFSR Supreme Court). In response to the Stalin supported Vyshinsky, who made \"critiques\" of Pashukanis' work, he was forced to publicly \"revise his thinking\", in 1930, 1934, and 1936. He refused however, to accept the baseless Stalinist refutations of his philosophy. In January of 1937 he was arrested, tried, and shot dead. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPashukanis's theory stands as one of fundamental importance to understanding law, in both content and form. He explains that law (where it regulates human conduct) is created when alienation and the opposition of classes begins. He binds this closely with the emergence of the commodity form in mediating material exchanges, as humans become bearers of rights (as opposed to customary privileges) as a result of being producers in a certain class. But where Marx and Engels explained the content of law resting within political economy, Pashukanis fills out Marxist theory by exploring the forms of law. Pashukanis argues that the rule of capitalist law will largely carry itself over into Socialism, that there <em>is no such thing as workers' law</em>, only the <em>dismantling</em> of capitalist law, as society moves from capitalism to socialism, and from  socialism into communism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNaturally, it was on this basis that Pashukanis was attacked by the Stalinists, who believed in <em>increasing</em> the power of the state and thus the rule of law, and in building up a gigantic bureaucracy around a myriad of rules and regulations. The Stalinists attempted to argue that law is an instrument of class rule, and that workers' should use it just as any other class has in the past -- completely misunderstanding that the essence of workers' rule is the destruction of the state, and thus, that by enforcing and building up the power of the state, the rule of workers' is crushed. Pashukanis emphasised that <em>the rule of law is not neutral</em>, that law is tied to political economy, and that just as exploitation cannot be class neutral, nor can law -- both institutions must be abolished during the Socialist transformation.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/pashukanis/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Evgeny Pashukanis Archive</a></p> \r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\n<p>\r\nWillie, or as he was more widely known later in life, Bill, Paul was born in 1884. He joined the Glasgow <a href=\"../../orgs/b/r.htm#britian-socialist-labour-party\">Socialist Labour Party</a> (SLP) early on and was to become its leading Marxist theorist and tutor and later a founding member of the Communist Party and one of its key figures in the 1920s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was based in Derby from around 1910 or 1911 and earned a living by running a small hosiery and drapery market stall as a one-man business. This gave the necessary independence required to become a semi-professional revolutionary and was so lucrative that other stalls were opened in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Rotherham and Chesterfield. These were surreptitiously used as centres for radical literature distribution and revolutionary fund-raising. Whilst this business and the role of wandering Marxist tutor brought Paul to temporary stays in many northern and midland&#8217;s towns and cities, he was mainly resident in Derby for the rest of his life, where he was married and had one daughter in the late 1920s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the 1914-18 war years, at least, in common with Arthur MacManus, Paul was a close personal friend of the Derby anti-war activist, Alice Wheeldon, and her family. (MacManus regularly came to Derby in connection with the shop stewards&#8217; movement and was a welcome visitor to the Wheeldon&#8217;s; he eventually married the second daughter Hettie.) Alice Wheeldon, who may have been involved in assisting army deserters to escape via Ireland to the USA, was imprisoned after an agent provocateur testified that she had planned a plot to poison the Prime Minister, Lloyd George! However, it seems more likely that she had sought to obtain poison to dispose of guard dogs to aid conscript escapes from army prisons. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul was joint editor, with <a href=\"../b/e.htm#bell-thomas\">Tom Bell</a>, of the SLP&#8217;s journal, <em>The Socialist</em>, and enjoyed a strong reputation as a formidable Marxist lecturer and theoretician. His SLP social science classes in Derby from 1917-18 were especially well attended and have been compared by the son of a contemporary &#8216;student&#8217; as having the same degree of repute as the similar approach of the Clydeside, John MacLean, in that highly complicated questions were well understood by gigantic audiences of working class people. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nA book of his lectures entitled <em>The State: its origin and functions</em> was published as a result of these classes. The work clearly follows classic Marxist themes, but more interestingly draws the same or similar theoretical conclusions as <a href=\"../l/e.htm#lenin-vladimir\">Lenin</a> was reaching at the same time, without the benefit of Paul being able to read Lenin&#8217;s work at this point, since it had not yet been translated. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul was also involved in Derby&#8217;s Clarion Club and in Manchester played a role in the Labour Party. No doubt his base in Manchester facilitated his contesting the 1918 election in Ince for the SLP, where he took 13% of the vote in a straight fight with an official Labour candidate. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the time of the foundation of the Communist Party, Willie Paul lived at &#8216;Pen Bryn&#8217; in what was then the village of Littleover, just on the outskirts of Derby. he was the key figure in the Derby Communist Unity group, which united local SLPers and Derby&#8217;s branch of the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/r.htm#british-socialist-party\">British Socialist Party</a>. He was made a member of the Communist Party&#8217;s Provisional Executive Committee, having been particularly involved in the debates inside the SLP over the unity process and the nature of the new party. He was a major influence in coalescing those in the SLP who favoured joining the CPGB. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the founding conference however, Paul displayed much of the revolutionary zeal, which the SLP had made its hallmark, by speaking against affiliation to the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/r.htm#british-labour-party\">Labour Party</a> in a most scathing and cynical way. This was of course entirely consistent with the SLP&#8217;s view of the matter. Nevertheless, the anti-affiliationists were beaten in the debate and the Communist Party&#8217;s policy was to be for affiliation. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul&#8217;s Derby Communist Unity Group was one of many smaller, local societies represented at the founding Unity Convention. The national Communist Unity Group was the faction inside the SLP, which had convened a special national conference at Nottingham to win the SLP to the notion of unity of all communist organisations. The majority of the SLP official leadership expelled the CUG activists for this action but most members followed Paul and his (subsequently more famous) Glasgow comrades into the new Party. Whilst the SLP rump carried on as a shell organisation it was a mirage for decades to come and eventually faded away. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul played an important role nationally for some time to come in the young Communist Party. He was editor of the <a href=\"../../../history/international/comintern/sections/britain/periodicals/communist_review/index.htm\"><em>Communist Review</em></a>, the CPGB theoretical journal from 1921-3. He stood again for Parliament, unsuccessfully, contesting the Manchester Rusholme constituency as a Labour-Communist candidate in the general elections of 1922 and 1924. It should be noted that he was bravely following Communist Party policy, even though he disagreed with it. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPaul was, thus, well known in Manchester, having had strong local connections there for at least ten years. He had often &#8220;rendered songs of the Irish potato famine&#8221; at the Openshaw BSP meetings for Harry Pollitt, later to become the long-standing leader of British Communism. Paul has been described by Pollitt&#8217;s &#8216;official&#8217; biographer as a &#8220;powerful and expressive baritone&#8221;. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe polled a respectable 21% of the vote against strongly fielded Tory and Liberal opponents in the 1922 election. In the following election, he achieved much the same result, but increased the share of the vote, this time as an official Communist with Labour backing. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe then became the editor of the Communist Party inspired <em>broad left</em> journal, the <em>Sunday Worker</em>, for the short period of its existence in the late 1920s. This reached a circulation of 100,000 and was unarguably a great success for the Party, so much so that it encouraged the drive to achieve a daily paper, the <em>Daily Worker</em>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLeaving the national stage during the period of the &#8216;Bolshevisation&#8217; of the CPGB, mainly possibly to marry and bring up a daughter, Paul nonetheless remained on the fringes of Communist politics all his days. In the 1930s and l940s he was closely identified with Soviet friendship activities in Derby. During the second world war, he was much involved in campaigning work in aid of the Soviet allies in Derby and and was a prominent supporter of the Derby Peace Council in the l950s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was widely regarded as a man of substance in the local labour Derbyshire movement, even though he was not particularly active in his later years, some have suggested due to family reasons. A veteran Communist Party member in Derby once implied that first his wife and then his daughter were violently opposed to his politics, the latter being embarrassed by the fame that his name still possessed decades after his death. Sadly, all his papers and documents were disposed of by the family when he died in 1958 in Derby but he had foresight to leave his considerable personal library to the Party in his will. </p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/\">Graham Stevenson</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/paul-william/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">William Paul Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "content": "\r\nThe founder of behaviourism, Russian physiologist known for the concept of conditioned reflex. In a now-classic experiment, he trained a dog by ringing a bell before mealtime, and through the course of time showed that simply by ringing the bell the dog would salivate. He developed a similar conceptual approach in his studies of human behaviour.  Pavlov&#8217;s work, taken together with that of Freud, marks the beginning of modern psychology, providing the first real elements of a materialist framework for the study of the psyche.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe son of a priest, Pavlov left the seminary to enter the University of St. Petersburg, where he studied chemistry and physiology, later travelling to Germany to study under Carl Ludwig and Rudolf Heidenhain. Returning to St Petersburg in 1888, he began research on the mechanisms regulating blood pressure. His skill as a surgeon allowed him to carry out measurements on dogs without anesthesia and trace the train of nervous stimuli involved in the system regulating blood pressure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1890, he became professor of physiology at the newly founded Institute of Experimental Medicine, where he remained until 1924. For most of his life from this time forward his work focussed on the action of the digestive glands of animals, in the course of which he formulated his famous laws of the conditioned reflex. (See Vygotsky's assessment of the significance of Pavlov's methodology in his <a href=\"../../../archive/vygotsky/works/crisis/psycri13.htm\" target=\"_top\">Two Psychologies</a>). Pavlov's aim was to establish on the basis of this one body-process, the correlation between objective, measurable physiological phenomena and the higher nervous activity associated with it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPavlov's relationship with the Bolsheviks after the Revolution is of considerable interest. On the one hand, Pavlov was soneone totally focussed on his science, but with a passionate commitment to pursuit of truth and a concern for precision and professionalism in his work which bordered on the obsessive; on the other hand, the Bolsheviks valued the rich inheritance of science from the old order, where science was the only way open to an ordinary citizen into high society, a practice which had created a scientific community superior to many in Western Europe. Conditions in Petrograd were desperate beyond belief by 1921-2, and Pavlov requested permission from Lenin to transfer his laboratory abroad. Lenin denied the request, and Pavlov refued personal privileges offered to him while his staff worked in near-starvation conditions. After returning from a visit to the US in 1923, he publicly denounced the Revolution, saying &#8220;For the kind of social experiment that you are making, I would not sacrifice a frog's hind legs!&#8221; After Stalin came to power in 1924, he resigned his post saying, &#8220;I also am the son of a priest, and if you expel the others I will go too!&#8221; See his <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/pavlov.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Lecture on the Cerebral Hemisphere</span></a>, from this period. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1927, he wrote to Stalin, protesting &#8220;On account of what you are doing to the Russian intelligentsia &#8211; demoralizing, annihilating, depraving them &#8211; I am ashamed to be called a Russian!&quot; In the late 1920s, he refused Nikolay Bukharin admission to his laboratory. Later on, like many others, with Russia under attack by Hitler, Pavlov moderated his criticism and got on with his scientific work as best he could.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeginning about 1930, Pavlov tried to apply his concept of conditional reflex to human psychoses, which he saw as a mechanism to shut out the external world, in much the same way that the body protects a wound by stiffening the muscles with an influx of blood. The idea was applied in the treatment of psychiatric patients in Russia, placing patients nonstimulating surroundings to moderate the stimulus for psychosis. Pavlov also developed a conditional reflex theory of language. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When Gorki&#263; was executed as a spy by the Stalin&#8217;s regime in 1937, Pavlovi&#263; became disillusioned with the USSR, and in 1939, after the signing of the treaty with Nazi Germany, he totally broke with the Communist movement.

The Survey however, was dissatisfied with his work for them and Peirce resigned in 1891, never enjoying regular employment for the remainder of his life. Peirce however went on to gain a formidable reputation in logic, for which he is most renowned, and made significant contributions in a stunningly wide range of sciences and technology. He also gave occasional lectures in philosophy at John Hopkins University and frequently addressed the National Academy of Sciences and other learned institutions.</p>\n<p>\nPeirce regarded Logic as identified with semiotics (or <a href=\"../../terms/s/e.htm#semiology\">Semiology</a>), the theory of signs. However, Peirce was never satisfied with his own system of views and endlessly subjected his formulations to amendment and change (a personality trait which may explain why the Survey found him a unsatisfactory employee!). He wanted to achieve an integral view of formal deduction, the &#8216;logic&#8217; of scientific progress, induction and what he called &#8220;abduction&#8221; &#8211; the formulation of new concepts which explain observed facts in a surprising way (like &#8220;lateral thinking&#8221;), and integrate acts directed at understanding or communicating with actions which actually <em>do</em> something. </p>\n<p>\nPeirce&#8217;s Pragmatism was first elaborated in a series of <span class=\"book\">Illustrations of the Logic of Science</span> in the <em>Popular Science Monthly</em> in 1877-78 including <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/peirce.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">How to Make Our Ideas Clear</span></a> in 1878.

        "content": "\r\nSwiss psychologist, philosopher and logician, developed theory of intellect formation based on the basis of the extensive study of children. Piaget regards the intellect as a system of operations derived within the subject from external object actions. Piaget&#8217;s \"genetic epistemology\" which showed through a study of child development how concepts and cognitive capacities are developed in a person through human activity in the course of individual growth, grasped the objectivity of concepts established in the mind through subject-object interactivity. Piaget investigated many problems of relating his work in experimental psychology to logic, biology, cybernetics and the broader development of natural science.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiaget&#8217;s early interests were in zoology, and by the age of 15 his publications on molluscs had gained him a European-wide reputation. At the University of Neuch&acirc;tel, he studied Zoology and Philosophy, receiving his doctorate in Zoology in 1918. Soon afterward, however, he became interested in psychology, combining his biological training with his interest in epistemology. He first went to Z&uuml;rich, where he studied under <a href=\"../../people/j/u.htm#jung-carl\">Carl Jung</a> and Eugen Bleuler, and then began two years of study at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1919. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Paris, Piaget devised and administered reading tests to schoolchildren and became interested in the types of errors they made, leading him to explore the reasoning process in these young children. By 1921 he had begun to publish his findings; the same year brought him back to Switzerland, where he was appointed director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. In 1926-29 he was professor of philosophy at the University of Neuch&acirc;tel, and in 1929 he joined the University of Geneva as professor of child psychology, remaining there until his death. In 1955 he established the International Centre of <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/piaget.htm\" target=\"_top\">Genetic Epistemology</a> at Geneva and became its director. In more than 50 books and monographs, Piaget developed the theme he first discovered in Paris, that the mind of the child evolves through a series of set stages to adulthood. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiaget saw the child as constantly creating and recreating his own model of reality, achieving mental growth by integrating simpler concepts into higher level concepts at each stage. He argued for a &#8220;genetic epistemology,&#8221; a timetable established by nature for the development of the child&#8217;s ability to think, and he traced four stages in that development.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe described the child during the first two years of life as being in a sensorimotor stage, chiefly concerned with mastering his own innate physical reflexes and extending them into pleasurable or interesting actions. During the same period, the child first becomes aware of himself as a separate physical entity and then realises that the objects around him also have a separate and permanent existence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the second, or preoperational, stage, roughly from age two to age six or seven, the child learns to manipulate his environment symbolically through inner representations, or thoughts, about the external world. During this stage, he learns to represent objects by words and to manipulate the words mentally, just as he earlier manipulated the physical objects themselves.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the third, or concrete operational, stage, from age 7 to age 11 or 12, occurs the beginning of logic in the child&#8217;s thought processes and the beginning of the classification of objects by their similarities and differences. During this period, the child also begins to grasp concepts of time and number.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe fourth stage, the period of formal operations, begins at age 12 and extends into adulthood. It is characterised by an orderliness of thinking and a mastery of logical thought, allowing a more flexible kind of mental experimentation. The child learns in this final stage to manipulate abstract ideas, make hypotheses, and see the implications of his own thinking and that of others. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiaget&#8217;s concept of these developmental stages caused a re-evaluation of older ideas of the child, of learning, and of education. If the development of certain thought processes was on a genetically determined timetable, simple reinforcement was not sufficient to teach concepts; the child&#8217;s mental development would have to be at the proper stage to assimilate those concepts. Thus, the teacher became not a transmitter of knowledge but a guide to the child&#8217;s own discovery of the world. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiaget reached his conclusions about child development through his observations of and conversations with his own children, as well as others and was involved in numerous dialogues with mathematicians and philosophers of his day, drawing on modern research in mathemtics to inform his ideas about the structural development of the mind and criticising the un-recognised psychological assumptions contained in the work of many philosophers. He only became aware of the work of <a href=\"../v/y.htm#vygotsky-lev\">Lev Vygotsky</a> long after Vygotsky had died, and paid tribute to Vygotsky for having anticipated many of his own most important discoveries.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\r\nSee text of <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/piaget.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Genetic Epistemology</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This upsurge of labour union activity, guided by the principles of Marxism which had been translated and distributed into Russia by the Emancipation of Labour group, gave rise to the <a href=\"../../orgs/r/u.htm#rsdlp\">Russian Social-Democratic Party</a>, in 1898. The unity of this party Plekhanov would spend the rest of his life defending, save for when the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-government\">Soviet Government</a> was established, when he disavowed the left half of the party: the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks\">Bolsheviks</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the late 1800s, one of Plekhanov's most passionate supporters was <a href=\"../../people/l/e.htm#lenin\">Vladimir Lenin</a>. Lenin admired Plekhanov as the founder of Russian Marxism and strove to master the revolutionary activity and party building Plekhanov had begun. In 1900, when Lenin founded <a href=\"../../periodicals/i/s.htm#iskra\">Iskra</a>, Plekhanov wrote for the paper, and together, they supported proletarian revolution backed by Marxist theory while attacking revisionists such as <a href=\"../../people/b/e.htm#bernstein-eduard\">Eduard Bernstein</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the time of the split in the R.S.D.L.P., Lenin and Plekhanov came head to head, never to theoretically meet again. Plekhanov wrote a book entitled, <em>What is not to be Done</em>, explaining that the party should not split, that, \"rather than having a split, it is better to put a bullet in one's brain\". Lenin, on the other hand, emphasised the importance of a split, in order to develop the different trends and opinions in the revolutionary movement. The party did split during the <a href=\"../../events/r/rsdlp.htm#second\">Second Congress</a>, forming the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks\">Bolshevik</a> and <a href=\"../../orgs/m/e.htm#menshevik\">Menshevik</a> parties; of which Plekhanov ultimately sided with the Mensheviks.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlekhanov theoretical position was that Russia's proletariat should be sent to the battlefields against the Russian autocracy, and after having overthrown it, they should work to establish a bourgeois government. This would allow the proletariat to grow to a great size, while so too did the bourgeoisie, allowing a bigger proletariat class to overthrow the now more powerful bourgeoisie, believing that the proletariat would eventually overpower the bourgeois government. Plekhanov stressed that Russia <em>must</em> pass through genuine capitalistic development, in order for the conditions and tools to be built to enable a Socialist revolution to occur.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, Plekhanov's theories were shown to be incorrect in many respects, most prominently in his negligence towards the revolutionary strength of Russia's peasantry. Instead of revising his theories in accord with the new developments of history, Plekhanov stuck to them and defended them admist a now much larger chorus of attackers: his theories were rapidly being discarded into the dustbin of history.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the <a href=\"../../events/w/o.htm#world-war-1-russia\">first World War</a>, Plekhanov took what Lenin dubbed a <a href=\"../../terms/s/o.htm#social-chauvinist\">social-chauvinist</a> stance: that German victory would be disasterous for the world's proletariat, but an entente victory would be much better for the world's proletariat. Plekhanov supported the World War, while millions of Russian's were dying and refusing to fight, up until the Soviet government signed the <a href=\"../../events/b/r.htm#brest-litovsk-treaty\">treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a>, which horrified Plekhanov.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the 1917 <a href=\"../../events/f/e.htm#february-revolution-1917\">February Revolution</a>, Plekhanov returned to Russia and gave his support to the <a href=\"../../orgs/p/r.htm#provisional-government\">Provisional government</a>, claiming it to have established a truly bourgeois government. By the time of the <a href=\"../../events/o/c.htm#october\">October Revolution</a>, Plekhanov was outraged, and fought to usurp the Soviet government, believing it premature.\n</p>\n<p>\nSee <a href=\"../../../archive/plekhanov/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Plekhanov Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n"

Sometimes credited with pre-figuring Einstein&#8217;s theory of relatvity, this claim is somewhat exaggerated. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoincar&eacute; was born into a distinguished family. Poincar&eacute; was extremely near-sighted, and frequently ill as a child. He became interested in mathematics during adolescence and attended the prestigious &Eacute;cole Polyt&eacute;chnique in Paris, where excelled in mathematics. Poincar&eacute; had an exceptional memory and had cultivated the ability to visualise anything he heard, and was able to perform complex mathematical calculations in his head. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing a brief appointment in mathematical analysis at the University of Caen, in 1881 Poincar&eacute; joined the University of Paris, where he lectured and wrote on mechanics, physics, pure and applied mathematics, probability and astronomy for the remainder of his life. He changed his lectures every year, covering a vast domain of topics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile still in his 20s, Poincar&eacute; developed the concept of auto-morphic functions, invariant under a specific group of transformations, a concept crucial to the development of non-Euclidean geometry, and over his life developed numerous mathematical techniques which found application across all branches of physics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1906, in a paper on the dynamics of the electron, he obtained some of the results of the special theory of relativity, but whereas Einstein developed the theory from elementary considerations concerning light signalling, like <a href=\"../h/e.htm#helmholtz-hermann\">Helmholtz</a>, Poincar&eacute; based his analysis on electromagnetic transmission of light through an ether. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter achieving fame as a mathematician, Poincar&eacute; turned his gifts to describing for the general public the meaning and importance of science and mathematics. <span class=\"book\">Science and Hypothesis</span>, <span class=\"book\">The Value of Science</span> and <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/poincare.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Science and Method</span></a> reached a wide public of non-professionals and were translated into many languages. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis most significant contribution to philosophy was as founder of Conventionalism, emphasising the arbitrary choice of concepts which simply reflect agreement among scientists based upon consideration of convenience, habit and simplicity. Conventionalism tends to lead to the rejection of the objective content of scientific concepts. A forerunner of the <a href=\"../../people/b/r.htm#bruuwer-luitzen\">intuitionist</a> school, he believed that some mathematical induction is <em>a priori</em> and independent of logic, and emphasised the sub-conscious in the psychology of mathematical discovery and invention. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\r\nSee Ernst Kolman and Sonya Yanovskaya&#8217;s <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/kolman.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Hegel &amp; Mathematics</span></a> and <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/help/percept.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Perception Under the Microscope</span></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He left his homeland after the defeat of Bela Kun&#8217;s abortive Soviet Republic, settling in France in 1921. In the course of his travels he had met Freud and Sandor Ferenczi in Vienna, and his interest in psychology was to result in the publication in 1928 of his &#8220;<em>Critique des fondements de la psychologie</em>&#8221; (<em>Critique of the Foundations of Psychology</em>). This work was the first outline of a materialist theory of social psychology, and was one of the influences on Vygotsky in the 1920s.</p>\r\n<p>In France he taught in the cities of Moulins, Evreux and at Saint-Maur, all the while active in the teachers&#8217; union. Sometime between 1929-31 (Party sources mention his being accepted on his second attempt at joining) he joined the French Communist Party, where he was in charge of the Economic Commission of the Central Committee. He taught at both the Workers&#8217; University and the PCF&#8217;s central school, and was among the founding group of the revue <em>La Pensée</em>. </p>\r\n<p>In September 1940, with France occupied, he entered the fight against the Nazis and launched two clandestine journals: <em>L&#8217;Université Libre</em> and <em>La Pensée Libre</em>, which he wrote for under the pen name Rameau. It was for the latter that he wrote his famous attack on Alfred Rosenberg: &#8220;<em>L&#8217;Obscurantisme au XXe siecle</em>&#8221; (<em>Obscurantism in the 20th Century</em>)</p>\r\n<p>Along with his wife Mai, also a Communist and Resistance fighter, he was arrested in February 1942 for violation of the law banning the Communist Party. While imprisoned at Santé prison in Paris he was in a cell next to that of the celebrated Communist and Resistance member Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier. In her testimony at the Nuremberg War Crimes trial Vaillant-Couturier spoke of Politzer&#8217;s prison experience: &#8220;Georges Politzer told me that during his interrogation, after having beaten him, he was asked if he didn&#8217;t want to write theoretical pamphlets for National-Socialism. When he refused they told him he would be put on the first train of hostages to be executed.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 1942 he was turned over to the Nazis and, as threatened, he was executed with a group of hostages on May 23,1942. His wife was transported to Auschwitz, where she died in March 1943.</p>\r\n<p>His 1935-36 courses at the Worker&#8217;s University were posthumously published as <em>Principes élémentaires de philosophie </em>(<em>Elementary Principles of Philosophy</em>).

Involved in the anti-war movement in 1914-18, he emerged as a shop stewards&#8217; leader of national standing by 1919. He then was at the fore of the successful struggle to prevent the British government supplying armaments to the enemies of Soviet Russia. He played a leading role in the Communist Party in the 1920s and was a delegate from the Boilermakers&#8217; Society to the TUC and the Labour Party conferences. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nPollitt and R. Palme Dutt worked closely together to remodel the Communist Party away from the pre-war heritage of ramshackle socialist debating societies towards a centralised, strategic force. Pollitt&#8217;s particular take on leadership represented a move away from a propagandist style of work towards organisation at the point of struggle, linking immediate struggles to longer-term objectives. Unquestionably, his great grasp was the importance of the revolutionary movement having mass links.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPollitt was, famously, the long-term leader of British Communists, being General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1929 to 1956, with the exception of a brief interlude from 1939. Then, he and Dutt differed sharply over the characterisation of the Second World War as being either an imperialist war or an anti-fascist one. Hitler&#8217;s invasion of the USSR in 1941 changed the character unambiguously and Pollitt returned to the leadership.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPollitt was especially linked with the development of the specifically British strategic programme of the Communist Party, <em>The British Road to Socialism</em>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe died in 1960.

As a high school student engaged in political activities chiefly led and organized by nationalist and religious forces. In the course of his activity he became acquainted with other activists, including Masoud Ahmadzadeh. Pouyan later went to Tehran to continue his study as a university student. In Tehran, he became familiar with Marxism and turned into a Marxist. In 1967, he, as well as Masoud Ahmadzadeh, his friend from childhood, and Abbas Meftahi, co-founded a Marxist group. They group enthusiastically studied political, social and economic conditions of Iran with a focus on consequences of the land reform carried out by the Shah&#8217;s regime under the title &#8220;white revolution.&#8221; The group began translating classics of Marxism and tried to find ways of organizing the working class in its struggle against the regime. Later, the group came to the conclusion that organization under the extreme repression cannot be the same as was experienced by communists in Russia or China. The group finally favored igniting the fire of armed struggle in rural areas and then in cities. The group later merged with another group, known as Jazani-Zarifi (referring to names of its founders) that started fighting in northern forests. The uprising was harshly quelled by the regime. Remnants of the group, including Pouyan, openly declared the formation of the Iranian People&#8217;s Fadaee Guerrilla Organization. The secret police of the regime identified Pouyan as a founder and leader of the organization and he went to hideout. The secret police that brutally tortured members of the IPFGO could locate the hideout of Pouyan and invaded it with hundreds of security forces.  On 24 May 1971, after an evidently unequal clash, the two guerrillas fought for hours and killed themselves with their last bullets. </p>\r\n<p>Pouyan wrote &#8220;<u>The Necessity of Armed Struggle and Refutation of the Theory of &#8220;Survival\"</u> in 1970. In this pamphlet he tries to show that Marxist groups&#8217; inactivity gave the upper hand to the regime to destroy them in the very early stages of their formation and that a continuous assault would help the vanguard of proletariat to survive. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../p.htm\">Index of the Letter P</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"

Proudhon was the first person to call himself an &#8220;anarchist,&#8221; the word previously only having been used as a term of abuse, during the French Revolution. He called his anarchism &#8220;mutualist socialism.&#8221; </p>\n<p>His most famous book was <em>What is Property?</em> (1840) (&#8220;it is theft,&#8221; he responded), but his other works include <em>De la célébration du Dimanche</em> (1839), <em>De la création de l'ordre dans l'humanité</em> (1843) and <em>Système des contradictions économiques, ou philosophie de la misère</em>, (in 2 volumes, 1846). A persistent critic of the French July Monarchy, he was nonetheless surprised by the outbreak of hostilities in Paris in February 1848. In his correspondence, he recounted his participation in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed &#8220;the first republican proclamation&#8221; of the new republic. The same correspondence indicates, however, that Proudhon had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of socioeconomic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. </p>\n<p>Determined to set the new republic on the correct course, Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, <em>Solution du problème social</em>, in which he articulated a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers that he believed would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. Pivotal here was his plan to establish a bank which would provide credit at a very low rate of interest and issue &#8220;exchange notes&#8221; that would circulate in lieu of money based on gold. </p>\n<p>Proudhon made his biggest impact on the public during the Second Republic through his journalism. He was connected with four different newspapers: <em>La Représentant du Peuple</em> (February 1848-August 1848); <em>Le Peuple</em> (September 1848-June 1849); <em>La Voix du Peuple</em> (September 1849-May 1850); <em>Le Peuple de 1850</em> (June 1850-October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical, combative journalism which alienated some, but appealed to many French workers. In his numerous articles he criticised the policies of the government and continued to propose the reform of credit and exchange. To realise his plan, he attempted to establish a popular bank (<em>Bank du Peuple</em>) early in 1849, but despite recruiting more than 13,000 subscribers, receipts were meagre and the enterprise never took off. </p>\n<p>Proudhon failed to get elected to the constituent assembly in April 1848, though his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon, and Lille. He was successful, however, in the complementary elections held on June 4, and was therefore a Deputy during the debates over the National Workshops. Proudhon had never advocated such workshops, perceiving them as essentially charity institutions which did not threaten the economic system, but he opposed their elimination unless some economic assurances could be given to the workers who relied on them for subsistence. </p>\n<p>Proudhon was shocked by the violence of the June Days. He visited the barricades personally to acquaint himself with the events that were unfolding and reflected in 1855 that his presence at the Bastille at this time was &#8220;one of the most honourable acts of my life.&#8221; But in general during the tumultuous events of 1848, Proudhon opposed insurrection and preached peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. He never fully approved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May, or June, 1848, though he sympathetically portrayed the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionaries had been forced to endure, and argued that the forces of reaction were the responsible parties for the occurrence of these tragic events. </p>\n<p>Following the June Days, Proudhon faced the criticism of conservatives within the national assembly, especially for the economic reforms that he continued to advance. Following a heated exchange within the committee of finance of the national assembly (of which Proudhon was a member), Proudhon&#8217;s proposals were condemned on the floor of the assembly by Adophpe Thiers. Proudhon responded with a three-and-a-half-hour speech on July 31 in which he argued that the abrogation of property was the essential economic meaning of the 1848 revolution and insisted that the country should &#8220;proceed with the social liquidation.&#8221; The speech was frequently interrupted by pointed rejoinders from the floor of the Assembly and was followed by a motion of censure that was supported even by Louis Blanc and Pierre Leroux. </p>\n<p>As this vote indicated, Proudhon&#8217;s relationship with the <em>Montagne</em> was strained. Though there was a brief attempt to form a new left-wing coalition in the fall of 1848, this failed because, in Proudhon&#8217;s opinion, the <em>Montagne</em> remained attached to political revolution rather than <em>social</em> revolution. Proudhon and the <em>Montagne</em> could put aside their differences long enough to vote together on November 4 against the new constitution (though for different reasons), but by the end of the month they were again at each others throats. </p>\n<p>Proudhon also had a run-in with the new President of the Republic, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, which led to his prosecution and imprisonment. Proudhon had opposed Bonaparte throughout 1848: he had criticised him in two articles in <em>Le Représentant du Peuple</em> in June 1848; he voted against allowing him to take a seat in the Constituent Assembly; he opposed the creation of a strong Executive elected directly by the people; he opposed Napoleon in the presidential elections of December 1848. Proudhon&#8217;s attacks became more aggressive in January 1849, and the government responded by getting the assembly to lift Proudhon&#8217;s immunity from prosecution and, in March 1849, had Proudhon sentenced to three years in prison and fined 3000F. Proudhon went into hiding for two months, although he continued to write articles for <em>Le Peuple</em>, but on the night of June 5 he was arrested and transferred to Sainte-Pélagie. </p>\n<p>During his three years in prison, Proudhon married and fathered a son, and wrote and published four books. The first, <em>Confession d'un révolutionnaire</em> (November 1849) was Proudhon&#8217;s personal account of the 1848 revolutions. The second, <em>Idée générale de la révolution au XIXe siècle</em> (July 1851), discussed the specific the specific reform proposals that Proudhon had articulated in <em>Solution du problème sociale</em>, but placed them in the context of the inevitable historical progression toward greater liberty and equality that Proudhon termed &#8220;revolution.&#8221; <em>La Révolution sociale demontrée par le coup d'état du 2 decembre 1851</em> (July 1852), was an appeal to Louis-Napoleon to work for the revolution by implementing social reforms. <em>Philosophie du progrès</em> (September 1853), was more philosophical in nature and had little to do with the Revolutions of 1848. </p>\n<p>Proudhon&#8217;s actions and writings during this period have always been controversial. Though clearly on the political left, his opposition to the provisional government and his public quarrels with prominent socialists like Louis Blanc made him unpopular with the <em>Montagne</em>. His attacks of Bonaparte, followed by his book urging him to embrace a progressive and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; program, have caused confusion and led to criticism. His stances concerning politics &#8212; opposition to universal suffrage followed by election to the constituent assembly and insistence that Bonaparte institute reforms &#8220;from above&#8221; &#8212; has made it easy to dismiss Proudhon as hopelessly inconsistent. However, Proudhon did pursue a consistent social program, one that he hoped to see implemented by different parties at different phases of the revolution. His general goal was to return the control of the productive process back to workers by ensuring that workers owned their own means of production, assisted by reforms of credit and exchange. The masthead slogan of his paper in 1848, <em>Le Représentant du Peuple</em>, stated it clearly: &#8220;What is the producer in actual society? &#8212; Nothing. What should he be? &#8212;  Everything.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Thrust into the public sphere by tumultuous events of 1848, Proudhon proved to be an ineffective political actor. As he himself perceptively noted in 1850, he was basically a &#8220;man of polemics, not of the barricades.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Proudhon&#8217;s ideas have continued to have influence up to the present day, especially in France, and the widespread movement for setting up intentional communities has its ideological roots in Proudhon&#8217;s ideas (see <a href=\"../../../subject/utopian/index.htm#communes\" target=\"_top\">Utopian Socialism Archive</a>).

Allowed to return to France after the 1869 amnesty he edited &#8220;Le Combat,&#8221; which was suppressed after the French defeat, but was replaced by &#8220;Le Vengeur.&#8221; At first a member of the National Assembly, he was to become a member of the Committee of Public Safety under the Commune, and was behind some of its better known acts of political vandalism: the destruction of the Vendome Column, of Thiers&#8217; residence, and the <em>Chapelle Expiatoire</em>, built to atone for the execution of Louis XVI. He was able to escape France after the crushing of the Commune, and though condemned to death in absentia in 1873 was allowed to return to France in 1880. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the extreme left, he died in 1889.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/pyat/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Felix Pyat Archive</a>.</p>\n\n"

He then joined the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolsheviks\">Bolsheviks</a> being expelled shortly afterwards from St Petersburg University and exiled for revolutionary agitation. In 1912 he took part in re-establishing the Kiev Committee of the Bolsheviks, but was again arrested and exiled. In October 1914 he fled to Japan and from there reached Europe where he attended the Berne Conference of the Bolsheviks in February 1915 together with Lenin, <a href=\"../b/u.htm#bukharin-nikolai\">Bukharin</a>, Zinoviev and Krylenko. He supported Lenin on the war question but joined Bukharin in opposing Lenin&#8217;s defence of the right of nations to self-determination. He became chairman of the Kiev committee of the Bolsheviks after the February Revolution and during October was chairman of the Revolutionary Committee there. Following the revolution he was Commissar of the State Bank, but then undertook underground work in the Ukraine under German occupation. He supported Bukharin&#8217;s &#8216;left communist&#8217; group which opposed the Brest peace in 1918. With the collapse of the Germans he became chairman of the provisional Ukrainian workers and peasants&#8217; government formed at Kursk in November 1918, but was replaced by Rakovsky in the Kharkov-based Ukrainian Soviet government. He then belonged to the left wing of the Ukrainian Central Committee. From 1919 to 1921 he held various party posts in the Red Army, but after the Civil War was put in charge of the Donbass Coal Industry Board to rehabilitate the mines in the area. In the trade union controversy of 1920-1921 he supported Trotsky and Preobrazhensky favouring a stronger administrative function for the Soviet unions. In 1923 he was made deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy. The same year he was elected a full member of the Central Committee on which he remained until 1927. He was a leading member of the 1923 <a href=\"../../orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition\">Left Oppositionist</a> and in 1926 supported Trotsky in the Joint Opposition. During this period he was occupied in various important financial and industrial posts. He was removed from the Central Committee and expelled from the Communist Party at the 15th Congress in December 1927 and was exiled. He capitulated to Stalin in 1929 and was given successive posts in banking and industrial management, becoming deputy People&#8217;s Commissar for Heavy Industry in 1933. He was expelled from the party again in 1936, framed at the second Moscow Trial and executed as a &#8216;Trotskyite&#8217; in January 1937.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../p.htm\">Index of the Letter P</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html> "

Continuing his studies of medicine in Vienna, Reich was admitted to the Psychoanalytical Society of Vienna at the young age of 23, where he joined a group of brilliant young analysts. </p>\n<p>\nAfter a bright start in his with the publication of <em>Characterial Analysis</em>, the first part of which always makes a classic on this subject, W. Reich radically moved away from psychoanalysis, more and more directed towards a Marxist position. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1928, he joined the Communist Party and toured the Soviet Union in 1929, visiting nursery schools and pedagogical centers. Lecturing in Moscow, he distinguished psychoanalyiss as a theory of psychology which the Soviet Union should embrace, from the &#8220;Freudist&#8221; worldview, psychologisation, which he denounced. He corresponded with Trotsky, met with Sergei Eisenstein and had a lecture published with critical comments by Party officials. His report on the visit, <i>The Sexual Revolution</i>, praised the undermining of patriarchal authority in the collective farms but warned that the banning of homsexuality and abortion foretold the demise of the Revolution. His experience reinforced his conviction that social change had to precede psychoanalysis. </p>\n<p>\nAfter returning to Vienna, he helped set up Revolution&auml;re Sozialdemokraten, a party faction aimed at preparing for armed struggle, and published <i>The Mass Psychology of Fascism.</i> While the Communist Party specualted on whether the German middle class would side with the rising Nazis, or with the proletariat, Reich was convinced that just as the elder son will always side with the father against his siblings, the German petty-bourgeoisie would side with the bourgeoisie.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1932, on the eve of Hitler&#8217;s triumph in Germany, he worked with Erich Fromm, Karl Landauer, the director of the Frankfurt Psychoanalytic Institute and Heinrich Meng at the Institute for Social Research in Frankurt, the beginning of the merging of Marxism and Psycholanalysis. </p>\n<p>\nReich saw sexual repression in society as the origin of psychological repression in the mind of an individual. Thus Reich urged a sexual revolution and greater sexual freedom in order to reduce the prevalence of neuroses, and facilitate the development of a more healthy political life.</p>\n<p>\nReich&#8217;s association for Proletarian Sexual Politics was active in Berlin, and reached a membership of 40,000. However, the Communist Party turned to Popular Front policies, making Reich&#8217;s activity untenable for them, and he was expelled from the Party in March 1933. Freud wanted to keep psychoanalysis out of politics, and Reich&#8217;s open revolutionary politics became too much even for the psychoanalysts, and in December 1933, he was expelled from the International Psychoanalytic Association. Isolated in this way as Fascism threatened to engulf Europe, Reich became increasingly unbalanced, and it became more and more difficult for even his closest supporters to defend him.</p> \n<p>\nReich fled Europe for the United States in 1939. His settled in Maine, where he founded the Orgone Institute in 1942, in agreement with his theories based on the power of the orgasm. Towards the end of his career, Reich worked out increasingly esoteric theories which had little impact in the analytical media, at least. </p>\n<p>\nFollowing a lawsuit by the American Food and Drug Administration charging him with making bogus sceintific claims, Reich was imprisoned and he finally died in prison.</p>\n\n\n\n"

His laissez-faire doctrines were typified in his Iron Law of Wages, which stated that all attempts to improve the real income of workers were futile and that wages perforce remained near the subsistence level. </p>\n<p>\nRicardo was the third son of a Dutch Jew who had made a fortune on the London Stock Exchange. At the age of 14 he entered his father's business. By 21, he had become a Unitarian, and married a Quaker. He continued as a member of the stock exchange, and in a few years acquired a fortune. </p>\n<p>\nHis interest in economic questions arose in 1799 when he happened to read Adam Smith's <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Wealth of Nations</a></span>. His first published work was <span class=\"book\">The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes</span> (1810), asserting that there was a close connection between the volume of bank notes and the level of prices and that the level of prices in turn affected foreign exchange rates and the inflow or outflow of gold.. A committee appointed by the House of Commons, known as the Bullion Committee, confirmed Ricardo's views and recommended the repeal of the Bank Restriction Act which had obliged the Bank to withhold payment in gold under the strain of war with France. </p>\n<p>\nAt this time Ricardo became friends withs the philosopher and economist James Mill (father of John Stuart Mill), the Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Malthus, best known for his theory that population tends to increase faster than the food supply. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1815 another controversy arose over the Corn Laws. A decline in wheat prices had led Parliament to raise the tariff on imported wheat. This provoked a popular outcry and caused Ricardo to publish his <span class=\"book\">Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock</span> (1815), in which he argued that raising the tariff on grain imports tended to increase the rents of the country gentlemen while decreasing the profits of manufacturers. </p>\n<p>\nIn his <span class=\"book\">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</span> (1817), Ricardo undertook to analyse the laws determining the distribution of the social product among the &quot;three classes of the community,&quot; namely, the landlords, the workers, and the owners of capital. He applied his findings more widely, however, and elaborated various other economic principles. He found the relative domestic values of commodities to be dominated by the quantities of labour required in their production, rent being eliminated from the costs of production. </p>\n<p>\nHe concluded that profits vary inversely with wages, which move with the cost of necessaries, and that rent tends to increase as population grows, rising as the marginal costs of cultivation rise. He supposed that there was little tendency to unemployment; but he remained apprehensive lest population grow too rapidly, depress wages to the subsistence level, and, by extending the margin of cultivation, reduce profits and check capital formation. He also concluded that trade between countries was not dominated by relative costs of production and by differences in internal price structures that reflected the comparative advantages of the trading countries and made exchange desirable. He treated monetary questions and especially taxation at length. Although he built in part upon the work of Adam Smith, he defined the scope of economics more narrowly than had Smith and included little explicit social philosophy. </p>\n<p>\nMarx fundamentally differs with Ricardo over the Falling Rate of Profit, Ricardo's theory of rent, law of comparative cost, the concept of money and wages and profits.\n</p>\n\n\n"

        "image": "pics/robeson-paul.jpg",
        "content": "\nThe extraordinarily multitalented Robeson was the first world-famous singer and actor to become a political activist during his peak performing years. Robeson&#8217;s father, a runaway slave who became a minister in Princeton, New Jersey, exerted a strong influence on the young Robeson, instilling in him a quiet dignity, a love for African-American culture, and an all-embracing humanism.</p>\n<p>An outstanding scholar-athlete at Rutgers University in 1915-19, Robeson went on to become one of the world&#8217;s leading concert singers, stage actors, and film stars in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. During the period 1927-39, when he was based in London, his artistic growth led him to study world cultures and to support social and political movements. He sang concerts to benefit trade unions, especially the Welsh coal-miners&#8217; union, and he came to see the connection between the struggles of the British working class and those of the oppressed colonial peoples. Robeson was introduced to socialist ideas through his friendship with George Bernard Shaw and his acquaintanceship with several leaders of the British labour Party. As a result, Robeson studied the classic Marxist writings and became attracted to the basic premises of communism.</p>\n<p>In the early 1930s Robeson met many African students in London and developed a deep appreciation of the close links between the African and African-American cultures, learning several African languages. He also met Jawaharlal Pandit Nehru of India, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Prompted by the desire to extend his artistic range, Robeson studied many other languages and cultures throughout the 1930s and 1940s, mastering Russian, Chinese, Hebrew, and most European languages. This focus on the centrality of culture went hand-in-hand with Robeson&#8217;s increasing radicalism &#8211; a duality that continued for the remainder of his career.</p>\n<p>Robeson responded to the rise of German fascism by becoming one of the world&#8217;s leading antifascists. Invited to the Soviet Union in 1934 by Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, Robeson was almost assaulted by Nazi storm troopers in Berlin as he changed trains on his way to Moscow. In the USSR he was deeply impressed by the lack of racial prejudice and by flourishing diverse cultures in the Soviet republics. These experiences and the communist leadership of the worldwide antifascist and anticolonialist struggles were the basis of his unwavering support for the Soviet people in their attempts to build socialism. The fact that Robeson viewed the Soviet Union and the world communist movement as reliable allies of the colonial liberation movements led him to form a close alliance with Communists despite his private misgivings about the Stalinist purges of 1936-38 and his disagreement with the Communist Left&#8217;s exaggerated emphasis on class priorities over &#8220;nationalist&#8221; priorities in the Third World.</p>\n<p>In 1938 Robeson demonstrated his commitment to the fight against fascism by going to Spain to sing and speak in support of the Spanish Republic in its civil war against General Francisco Franco&#8217;s fascist rebellion. The profound effect this experience had on Robeson&#8217;s radicalization was reflected in his dramatic statement at that lime: &#8220;The artist must elect to fight for freedom or for slavery. I have made my choice; I had no alternative.&#8221; By 1939, Robeson was a key figure symbolizing on a world scale the unity of the antifascist and anticolonial struggles.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 1939 Robeson returned from England to the United States, where he continued his highly successful concert and theater career while simultaneously becoming a leader of the civil rights movement and a spokesman for left-wing causes. He was the first major performing artist to refuse to perform for segregated audiences and to lead voter registration campaigns in the Deep South. Robeson also played an important role in support of the union-organizing drive of the CIO in the early 1940s, and in bringing black workers into the unions.</p>\n<p>In 1946 Robeson challenged President Harry S Truman&#8217;s refusal to sponsor legislation against lynching by telling him that in the absence of federal protection blacks would exercise their right of armed self-defense. An opponent of the Cold War from its inception, Robeson attended a world peace conference in Paris in 1949 and expressed the view that black Americans should not fight an aggressive war against the Soviet Union on behalf of their own oppressors. In the wake of those remarks, the U.S. government and the media launched an attack of unprecedented ferocity against Robeson that lasted for nine years.</p>\n<p>Robeson&#8217;s passport was revoked in 1950 and was not restored until 1958. Inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of State, and numerous other U.S. government agencies compiled tens of thousands of documents on Robeson and illegally harassed him over a period of more than twenty years. Robeson was also blacklisted in the entertainment industry and prevented from appearing in professional engagements until 1957. Despite this persecution, Robeson continued to sing and speak in black churches and in the halls of the few surviving left-wing trade unions. He also wrote a book titled <em>Here I Stand</em> in collaboration with the black writer and journalist Lloyd I. Brown in which he outlined the program and strategy subsequently adopted by the civil rights movement and foretold the advent of the movement for economic justice.</p>\n<p>During the anticommunist witch-hunts of the late 1940s and the 1950s, Robeson defended the rights of Communists and defied congressional committees when they compelled him to testify before them. Although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he refused on constitutional grounds to answer any questions concerning Party membership or affiliation.</p>\n<p>Robeson remained publicly neutral concerning the USSR-China rift that began in the late 1950s, maintaining his cordial relations with both countries, and expressed no opinion about Nikita Khrushchev&#8217;s &#8220;secret speech&#8221; in 1956 denouncing Stalin&#8217;s crimes However, Robeson&#8217;s political attitude on these issues was conveyed indirectly by his personal friendship with Khrushchev and his enthusiastic support of Khrushchev&#8217;s domestic and foreign-policy reforms.</p>\n<p>In 1958 Robeson&#8217;s passport was restored on the basis of a Supreme Court decision, and he traveled abroad for five years to reestablish his artistic career. After a successful comeback, Robeson became ill with circulatory disease, and in 1963 he returned to the United States to retire. Contrary to the claims of the media, Robeson was not disillusioned or embittered. As he put it in 1973, three years before his death from a stroke: &#8220;Though ill health has compelled my retirement, you can be sure that in my heart I go on singing.&#8221; Drawing upon lyrics he had made world famous, he continued, &#8220;I must keep laughing instead of crying, I must keep fighting until I&#8217;m dying, and Ol&#8217; Man River, he just keeps rolling along.&#8221; </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/robeson/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Paul Robeson Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n"

While not a member of the Commune he was a supporter, continuing his journalism during this period in &#8220;Le Mot d&#8217;Ordre.&#8221; Arrested when trying to escape Paris on May 20, 1871, during the Bloody Week, he was sentenced to deportation for life.

Four months after his arrival, together with five other exiled Communards, Rochefort escaped the colony and fled to Australia and, later, the United states. </p>\n<p>Amnestied in 1880, Rochefort returned to France and political life, and was again elected deputy in 1885. But the former left-wing Rochefort had now moved to the right, and was perhaps the most important publicist for General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger&#8217;s overwhelming success in the elections of 1889 fueled a putschist movement that could very well have toppled the Republic had the general himself not lost his nerve. Boulanger went into exile in Brussels (where he committed suicide in 1891) and Rochefort followed him there. </p>\n<p>The Rochefort who returned to France in 1895 was very little like the Rochefort of his youth.

In 1907, Rocker represented the federation at the International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam in 1907.

        "content": "\nLeading theoretician of Pan-Africanism.</p>\n<p>Walter Rodney was born in Georgetown, Guyana on March 23, 1942. His was a working class family-his father was a tailor and his mother a seamstress. After attending primary school, he won an open exhibition scholarship to attend Queens College as one of the early working-class beneficiaries of concessions made in the filed of education by the ruling class in Guyana to the new nationalism that gripped the country in the early 1950s. </p>\n<p>While at Queens College young Rodney excelled academically, as well as in the fields of athletics and debating. In 1960, he won an open scholarship to further his studies at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. He graduated with a first-class honors degree in history in 1963 and. he won an open scholarship to the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. In 1966, at the age of 24 he was awarded a Ph.D. with honors in African History. </p>\n<p>His doctoral research on slavery on the Upper Guinea Coast was the result of long meticulous work on the records of Portuguese merchants both in England and in Portugal. In the process he learned Portuguese and Spanish which along with the French he had learned at Queens College made him somewhat of a linguist. </p>\n<p>In 1970, his Ph.D. dissertation was published by Oxford University Press under the title, <em>A History of the Upper Guinea Coast, 1545-1800</em>. This work was to set a trend for Rodney in both challenging the assumptions of western historians about African history and setting new standards for looking at the history of oppressed peoples. According to Horace Campbell:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;This work was path-breaking in the way in which it analyzed the impact of slavery on the communities and the interrelationship between societies of the region and on the ecology of the region.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Walter took up his first teaching appointment in Tanzania before returning to his alma mater, the University of the West Indies, in 1968. This was a period of great political activity in the Caribbean as the countries begun their post colonial journey. But it was the Black Power Movement that caught Walter&#8217;s imagination. </p>\n<p>Some new voices had begun to question the direction of the post-independence governments, in particular their attitude to the plight of the down-trodden. The issue of empowerment for the black and brown poor of the region was being debated among the progressive intellectuals. Rodney, who from very early on had rejected the authoritarian role of the middle class political elite in the Caribbean, was central to this debate. He, however, did not confine his activities to the university campus. He took his message of Black Liberation to the gullies of Jamaica. In particular he shared his knowledge of African history with one of the most rejected section of the Jamaican society &#8211; the Rastafarians. </p>\n<p>Walter had shown an interest in political activism ever since he was a student in Jamaica and England. Horace Campbell reports that while at UWI Walter &#8220;was active in student politics and campaigned extensively in 1961 in the Jamaica Referendum on the West Indian Federation.&#8221; While studying in London, Walter participated in discussion circles, spoke at the famous Hyde Park and, participated in a symposium on Guyana in 1965. It was during this period that Walter came into contact with the legendary CLR James and was one of his most devoted students. </p>\n<p>By the summer of 1968 Rodney&#8217;s &#8220;groundings with the working poor of Jamaica had begun to attract the attention of the government. So, when he attended a Black Writers&#8217; Conference in Montreal, Canada, in October 1968, the Hugh Shearer-led Jamaican Labor Party Government banned him from re-entering the country. This action sparked widespread riots and revolts in Kingston in which several people were killed and injured by the police and security forces, and millions of dollars worth of property destroyed. Rodney&#8217;s encounters with the Rastafarians were published in a pamphlet entitled <em>Grounding with My Brothers</em>, that became a bible for the Caribbean Black Power Movement. </p>\n<p>Having been expelled from Jamaica, Walter returned to Tanzania after a short stay in Cuba. There he lectured from 1968 to 1974 and continued his groundings in Tanzania and other parts of Africa. This was the period of the African liberation struggles and Walter, who fervently believed that the intellectual should make his or her skills available for the struggles and emancipation of the people, became deeply involved.. It was from partly from these activities that his second major work, and his best known &#8212; <em>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em> &#8212; emerged. It was published by Bogle-L&#8217;Ouverture, in London, in conjunction with Tanzanian Publishing House in 1972. </p>\n<p>This Tanzanian period was perhaps the most important in the formation of Rodney&#8217;s ideas. According to Horace Campbell:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;Here he was at the forefront of establishing an intellectual tradition which still today makes Dar es Salaam one of the centers of discussion of African politics and history. Out of he dialogue, discussions and study groups he deepened the Marxist tradition with respect to African politics, class struggle, the race question, African history and the role of the exploited in social change. It was within the context of these discussions that the book, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa was written.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Campbell also reports that</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;In he same period, he wrote the critical articles on Tanzanian Ujamaa, imperialism, on underdevelopment, and the problems of state and class formation in Africa. Many of his articles which were written in Tanzania appeared in <em>Maji Maji</em>, the discussion journal of the TANU Youth League at the University. He worked in the Tanzanian archives on the question of forced labor, the policing of the countryside and the colonial economy. This work &#8212; <em>World War II and the Tanzanian Economy</em> &#8212; was later published as a monograph by Cornell University in 1976.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Rodney also developed a reputation as a Pan-Africanist theoretician and spokesperson. Campbell says that &#8220;In Tanzania he developed close political relationships with those who were struggling to change the external control of Africa He was very close to some of the leaders of liberation movements in Africa and also to political leaders of popular organizations of independent territories. Together with other Pan-Africanists he participated in discussion leading up to the Sixth Pan-African Congress, held in Tanzania, 1974. Before the Congress he wrote a piece: &#8220;Towards the Sixth Pan-African Congress: Aspects of the International Class Struggle in Africa, the Caribbean and America.&#8221; </p>\n<p>In 1974, Walter returned to Guyana to take up an appointment as Professor of History at the University of Guyana, but the government rescinded the appointment. But Rodney remained in Guyana, joined the newly formed political group, the Working People&#8217;s Alliance. Between 1974 and his assassination in 1980, he emerged as the leading figure in the resistance movement against the increasingly authoritarian PNC government. He give public and private talks all over the country that served to engender a new political consciousness in the country. During this period he developed his ideas on the self emancipation of the working people, People&#8217;s Power, and multi-racial democracy. </p>\n<p>On July 11, 1979, Walter, together with seven others, was arrested following the burning down of two government offices. He, along with Drs Rupert Roopnarine and Omawale, was later charged with arson. From that period up to the time of his murder, he was constantly persecuted and harassed and at least on one occasion, an attempt was made to kill him. Finally, on the evening of June 13, 1980, he was assassinated by a bomb in the middle of Georgetown. </p>\n<p>Walter was married to Dr Patricia Rodney and the union bore three children &#8211; Shaka, Kanini and Asha. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From http://www.guyanacaribbeanpolitics.com/</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../subject/africa/rodney-walter/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Walter Rodney Archive</a></p> \n\n\n"

        "content": "\nRoman Rosdolsky was born in 1898\nin Lemberg (now L&#8217;vov, in Ukraine) which was then\npart of the Austria-Hungarian monarchy. As the son of a well-known\nUkrainian philologist, he grew up in a milieu of Ukrainian nationalism,\nbut while still at high school he joined the socialist movement and\nbecame a convinced internationalist. During the First World War he and\nhis friends founded an underground organisation &#8211; &#8216;The International\nRevolutionary Socialist Youth of Galicia&#8217; &#8211; which edited an illegal\nperiodical devoted to the struggle against the war. After the outbreak\nof the Russian revolution, this organisation provided the leaders of\nthe Communist Party of West Ukraine (which later became a section of\nthe Communist Party of Poland). Almost the entire leadership of this\nparty became a victim of the purges in the early thirties, which began\nin the CPSU and the Soviet Union. Rosdolsky was not living there and so\navoided this fate.</p>\n  \n<p>After the First World War,\nRosdolsky emigrated, firstly to Prague and later to Vienna. In Vienna\nhe worked for several years for the &#8216;Marx-Engels Institute&#8217; (Moscow),\nfor which he carried out research into historical sources in the Vienna\nArchives. At the beginning of the thirties, he joined the Trotskyist\nmovement and till the end of his life he identified with the ideas of\nTrotsky.</p>\n  \n<p>As a member of a nationally\noppressed peasant nation, Rosdolsky&#8217;s principal interest was in a\nMarxist analysis of the nationalities problem and the history of the\npeasantry. His dissertation, which gained him a PhD in political\nscience, bore the title&nbsp;<em>Marx and Engels on the\nproblem of the nations without a history</em> (in German).\nAfter the seizure of power by Austro-Fascism in 1934, he had to leave\nVienna and return to his native land, which in the meantime had fallen\nto Poland. Working at the Institute for Economic History at Lemberg\nUniversity he then published <em>The village community in East Galicia and\nits dissolution</em>. (Lwow 1936, in Polish). The outbreak of the Second\nWorld War interrupted the publication of his two volume work on peasant\noppression in Galicia. It only appeared in Warsaw in 1962.</p>\n  \n<p>At the beginning of the Second\nWorld War, Rosdolsky was living in Cracow, where he was imprisoned by\nthe Gestapo in 1942. He spent the following years in the concentration\ncamps of Auschwitz, Ravensbruck and Oranienburg in Germany. At the end\nof the war he taught for a short while in an Austrian trade union\nschool; in 1947 he left for the USA. There his political past prevented\nhim from gaining an academic post. By accident he discovered in an\nAmerican library one of &#8216;only three or four copies of the original [1939-41 &#8211; SP] Moscow edition in the West&#8217;. He immediately recognised the enormous theoretical significance of this manuscript and\nspent several years writing a commentary on it. This commentary &#8211; <em>The Making of Marx&#8217;s\nCapital</em>, Rosdolsky&#8217;s best-known book &#8211; was only published\nafter his death.</p>\n  \n<p>In the first years of his\nresidence in the United States, Rosdolsky also completed a work he had\nbegun with his dissertation &#8216;Friedrich Engels and the problem of the\nnations without a history&#8217; (Hannover, 1964 <em>Archiv fur\nsozialgeschichte</em> Vol IV) in which he criticised the\nposition of Marx and Engels on the small Slav nationalities during the\nrevolution of 1848. He developed the argument that these nationalities\nwent over to the camp of the Austrian monarchy, because the\nrevolutionary Polish and Hungarian nobility shrank back from a real\nliberation of the peasants.</p>\n\n<p>Rosdolsky also dealt with the\nrole of the peasantry in the revolution of 1848 in a book <em>The peasant deputies in\nthe Constituent Austrian Reichstag 1848-9</em>. In this work,\nbased on exhaustive studies in the Austrian Archives, Rosdolsky\nexplained the failure of the 1848 revolution by the inability of the\nliberal bourgeoisie and the nobility to carry out a &#8216;Jacobinist&#8217;\nsolution to the agrarian question.</p>\n\n<p>In his last years Rosdolsky\nintended to write a historical work on the peace treaty of Brest\nLitovsk. This work was to counter the legend which had grown up since\nLenin&#8217;s death that he would have supported the &#8216;politics of peaceful\nco-existence&#8217;. Rosdolsky only succeeded in finishing two chapters: one\ndealt with the social basis of opportunism, the material roots of the\nwar in the imperialist epoch, and the Bolsheviks&#8217; struggle against\nKautskyism; the other, examining the strike in Vienna January 1918, was\na concrete case of the extent to which the social-democrats were able\nto betray the struggle of the working class.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Roman Rosdolsky died in Detroit on 20 October 1967.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/rosdolsky/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Roman Rosdolsky Archive</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">Steve Palmer</p>\n\n\n"

He joined the Social Democratic Federation in 1895, where he was very much part of its left wing. In 1901, he also joined the Russian Social Democratic and Labour Party (RSDLP) as a British based member. The RSDLP split into two factions, the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks but Rothstein was a strong supporter of the Bolsheviks. Lenin frequently visited Rothstein and his family on his own visits to London, as in 1905.</p>\n<p>The SDF leader, H.M. Hyndman, was acutely disturbed by the election to the SDF executive in 1900 of Theodore Rothstein which was tinged by more than a whiff of anti-semitism. Both Rothstein and Zelda Kahan, who was also of Russian-Jewish origin, led the opposition inside the SDF to Hyndman&#8217;s growing support for British militarism arising from his mistrust of German imperial ambitions, </p>\n<p>Theodore Rothstein supported the unity process that led to the formation in 1911, by a merger between a number of socialist groups and the SDF (which had become the Social Democratic Party in 1907) to create the British Socialist Party. Even though Theodore Rothstein was working for the Foreign Office and the War Office as a Russian translator he was strongly against the 1914-18 war. He took a prominent part in the move to oust the Hyndman and his &#8220;patriotic&#8221; national clique in the BSP in 1916 and also took part in founding of the Communist Party. </p>\n<p>But he partly returned to Russia in 1920 and then increasingly became more involved in the USSR so that he remained there permanently. From 1921 to 1930 he was engaged in diplomatic work, starting with being the Soviet representative in Iran in 1921. He became Director of the Institute of World Economy and World Politics and, from 1939, was an Academician, receiving the Order of Lenin. Theodore also wrote a number of significant books, including on Egypt, while his <em>From Chartism to Labourism</em> (1929) was a pioneering work on British labour and trade union history.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">(Derived in part from Graham Stevenson&#8217;s <em>Compendium of Communist Biographies</em>.)</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../archive/rothstein/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Theo Rothstein Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nNarendranath Bhattacharya, who later assumed the name Manabendra Nath Roy, was an Indian Communist leader. He was politically a product of militant nationalism which had emerged and crystallised in the Indian National Congress towards the end of the nineteenth century. Leftism in India has been a combination of diverse strands of approaches, traditions and practices. M. N. Roy, a principal figure in revolutionary nationalism in his early years, eventually became the forerunner of Marxian politics in India. The Lenin-Roy debate on the national and colonial question continues to plague the communist movement to the present day. Roy directed from abroad the communist movement in India and sent programmes to the National Congress during its heyday of NCD and CD (Civil Disobedience). He added an operative part to the national struggle by a scheme to turn the Congress into a constituent assembly and as a state within a state to capture power in the pattern of the French Revolution. He persistently tried to radicalise the Congress and raised the slogan of alternative leadership. </p>\n\n<p>Arriving in India in early 1930s he led intensive movements of workers and peasants. Before long, a cleavage developed between Roy&#8217;s adherents called the Roy group on the one hand, and the CSP and CPI on the other, on various issues, ideological and organisational. Shortly, the Left groups had to accept such courses of action for which they had castigated Roy earlier. </p>\n\n<p>On the outbreak of the World War II, the Right and the Left were confused about the Congress policy, while Roy characterised the war anti-fascist and supported the allies, foreseeing that India would attain independence following the defeat of the Axis powers and inevitable weakening of the economic base of the British Imperialism. Roy was finally vindicated. </p>\n\n<p>Roy had a leading role in revolutionary movements in India, Mexico, the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Indonesia and China. Like Marx he was both and activist and a philosopher; in fact Lenin called him &#8220;the Oriental Marx.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Roy tried to organize an armed insurrection in India in 1915; founded the Communist Party of Mexico (1919) and the emigr&#233; Communist Party of India in Tashkent (1920); rose to occupy the highest offices of the Communist International and led the Comintern&#8217;s delegation to China (1927). At the same time he authored such Marxist classics as <em>India in Transition</em> (1922), <em>The Future of Indian Politics</em> (1926) and <em>Revolution and Counter-revolution in China</em> (1930); and founded the organ of the emigr&#233; Communist Party of India, <em>The Vanguard</em> (and later <em>The Masses</em>) and edited it for seven years (1922-28).</p>\n\n<p>Roy broke with the Communist International in 1929 having publicly opposed the extreme left sectarian policy adopted at its Sixth Congress. Returning to India he spent six years in various prisons during which he wrote a 3000-page draft manuscript provisionally titled <em>The Philosophical Consequence of Modern Science</em>. On his release he campaigned against every variety of authoritarianism, supported the anti-fascist war, drew up a Draft Constitution for free India and the outlines of a decentralist people&#8217;s plan for economic development.</p>\n\n<p>Disillusioned with both bourgeois democracy and communism, he devoted the last years of his life to the formulation of an alternative philosophy which he called <em>Radical Humanism</em> and of which he wrote a detailed exposition in <em>Reason, Romanticism and Revolution. </em>He wrote a lot of pamphlets for beginners. He was an active Marxist for the most part of his life, but he abandoned Marxist philosophy and indulged in pleading meaningless fellow-feelings among different religions of India and promoting pale humanistic thoughts. He traced morality to biological roots and suggested that human progress depended on progress towards liberty and truth. </p>\n\n<p>In 1948, he launched the Radical Humanist Movement in India, which in 1952 joined with other humanist groups in Europe and America to found the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Roy was one of the first Vice-presidents. The humanist centre in Bombay is called the M. N. Roy Memorial Human Development Campus.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">By Hasan; most of the facts in this sketch have been taken from: <em>Leftism in India; M. N.

In Marx, he wrote, two elements must be distinguished: the scientific analysis of the social relations of production within social economic formations, and the conception of Man, the agent of the history which refuses to be dominated. He dedicated himself to his role as a student of Marxism, which he understood as a return to an authentic Marx freed from the interpretation of Marxists. Rubel was a critic of &#8220;really existing Socialism,&#8221; judging their ideological superstructure to represent the false consciousness of the bureaucratic caste that had approriated from the proletariat the role of its representative.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/rubel/index.htm\">Maximilien Rubel Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

From July 1914 it published party news in a series of official newspapers, called variously <em>The American Socialist</em> (1914-1918), <em>The Eye-Opener</em> (1918-1919), <em>The Socialist World</em> (1920-1925), and The American Appeal (1926-1927).]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this time Ruthenberg traveled to to many cities throughout the American Northeast and Midwest, speaking to labor groups, trade union organizations, and anti-war groups, building a network of contacts. Ruthenberg was associated with the far left so-called &#8220;Impossibilist&#8221; wing of the SPA, which had little hope for the efficacy of ameliorative reform, seeking instead revolutionary socialist transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his personal disdain for political half-measures, Ruthenberg was a frequent electoral candidate of the Socialist Party. He first ran for Ohio State Treasurer in 1910, and was later the party&#8217;s nominee for Senate in 1916, for Mayor of Cleveland in 1917 (receiving 27,000 votes of 100,000 cast), and for the United States Congress in 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruthenberg was a delegate to the seminal 1917 Emergency National Convention of the SPA. There he was elected to the Committee on War and Militarism and was one of three primary authors of the aggressively antimilitarist St. Louis program, along with <a href=\"../h/i.htm#hillquit-morris\">Morris Hillquit</a> and Algernon Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After American entry into World War I, Ruthenberg continued to publicly attack the <a href=\"../../terms/i/m.htm#imperialism\">\"Imperialist\"</a> conflict and American participation therein. He was arrested for allegedly violating the Espionage Act by obstructing the draft in connection with a speech given at a rally on May 17, 1917. Also charged at the same time were Ohio State Secretary <a href=\"../w/a.htm#wagenknecht\">Alfred Wagenknecht</a> and State Organizer Charles Baker. The trio were tried together in July of 1917 and sentenced to 1 year in the Ohio State Penitentiary, a decision upheld by the US Supreme Court on January 15, 1918. Informed of this decision, issued a statement declaring:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">    The Supreme Court has decided we must spend a year in jail. The crime for which we are convicted is truth telling. We believe in certain principles; we fought for those principles, and we go to jail ostensibly for inducing a certain Alphones Schue not to register. The charge is merely and excuse.... The important fact is that the ruling class feared our message to the workers and tried to silence that message. That fact should make a hundred willing workers take up the work we lay down...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruthenberg, Wagenknecht, and Baker served almost 11 months of their sentence, finally being released on December 8, 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The communist years (1919-1927)</strong><br /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 1919 Cleveland May Day Riot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freed from prison in December of 1918, Ruthenberg dove in with both feet to the burgeoning left wing movement rocking the Socialist Party. May Day of 1919 was an event of enormous enthusiasm and great fear. A gigantic assembly was planned in Cleveland, in which four parades of marchers, many waving red flags, would come together in the public square to hear speeches and rally for freedom for <a href=\"../d/e.htm#debs-eugene\">Eugene V. Debs</a> and Tom Mooney and the adoption of the 6 hour day and the $1 minimum wage. As many as 20,000 people are said to have participated in the march, with 20 to 30,000 more people lining the streets to watch. Ruthenberg later described the events that followed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">    When the head of the line was within a block of the Public Square the first trouble occurred. An officer in the uniform of the Red Cross jumped from a &#8220;Victory&#8221; Loan truck and endeavored to take a red flag which a soldier in uniform was carrying at the head of the procession. A scuffle followed in which other soldiers from the truck and some businessmen joined. During the scuffle one of these businessmen ddrew a revolver and wildly threatened the workers in the procession. In fiveminutes, however, the struggle was over. The lieutenant and his supporters were driven back to the sidewalk, the head of the line reformed, and with the red flag still flying, marched on to the Public Square.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, the police made their appearance:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">    They came down Superior Ave., which divides the &#8220;Square&#8221; into norther and southern sections, headed by the mounted squad, followed by auto load after load. The newspapers later reported that 700 men had been concentrated at the Central Statiion, who now descended upon the marchers.... The first thousand or so of workers marched onto the square and took possession of the &#8220;Victory&#8221; Loan speakers&#8217; stand, which had been built over the stone blocks placed on the Public Square for the use of speakers at public meetings... The chairman was about to introduce [me] as the first speaker when an officer and a few soldiers tried to climb to the platform, demanding that the soldier that held the red flag give it up... [Then], without warning, a squad of mounted police dashed into the audience, driving their horses over the assembled workers and clubbing them as they went.&#8221; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A riot ensued, pitting the police and their supporters (backed by tanks) against the marchers. Two marchers were killed in the fighting, hundreds injured, and about 150 arrested in this Cleveland May Day Riot.[10] Ruthenberg was charged for incitement to murder in connection with this event but no conviction was obtained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Formation of the CPA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruthenberg was an early endorser of the <a href=\"../../../history/usa/parties/spusa/1919/0500-berenberg-lwmanifesto.pdf\"><em>Left Wing Manifesto</em></a> written by Louis C. Fraina and around which the formal Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party congealed. He was a Left Wing-supported candidate for the Socialist Party&#8217;s governing National Executive Committee in the party election of 1919, the result of which was overturned by the outgoing NEC ostensibly on the grounds of election fraud carried out by some of the branches associated with the party&#8217;s language federations. Ruthenberg was a delegate to the June 1919 Convention of the Left Wing Section and was elected there as a member of the faction&#8217;s governing National Council. Ruthenberg was initially supportive of the tactic of continuing to fight &#8220;to win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing&#8221; at its forthcoming 1919 Emergency National Convention in Chicago, but in the face of federation pressure for immediate formation of a Communist Party of America and the apparently hopeless task faced by Wagenknecht &amp; Co., Ruthenberg shifted his support to the Federations and their call for an immediate Communist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dominated as it was sure to be by the Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Latvian <a href=\"../../../history/usa/eam/lf/languagefeds.html\">language federations</a>, the anglophonic Ruthenberg was a valuable commodity to federation leaders like Alexander Stoklitsky, Nicholas Hourwich, and Joseph Stilson. Nor did Ruthenberg owe any allegiance to the idiosyncratic Socialist Party of Michigan, led by John Keracher and Dennis Batt. Therefore, the ambitious Ruthenberg made an ideal candidate to head the new organization, which was established in Chicago on September 1, 1919, as the Communist Party of America (CPA). While decisive authority on the floor of the convention and on the Central Executive Committee which it elected remained in the hands of the so-called &#8220;Russian Federations,&#8221; Ruthenberg was elected by the Chicago conclave as the first Executive Secretary of the new organization. Ironically, it was his old Ohio party comrade and prison mate, Alfred Wagenknecht who was elected to head the rival <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#clp\">Communist Labor Party of America</a> (CLA) in the aftermath of the failed effort to win control of the Socialist Party at its August 1919 Convention. A period of bitter and acrimonious rivalry followed, in which both of the competing American communist organizations sought to win the favor (and financial support) of the  <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#communist-international\">Communist International</a> (Comintern). Adding to the complexity of the situation, the <a href=\"../../../history/usa/eam/slp/socialistlaborparty.html\">Socialist Labor Party of America</a> and the Socialist Party of America sought affiliation with the Comintern as well. The Comintern was adamant about its structure, however, and it sought one and only one centralized organization in each country. Merger between the CPA and CLP was demanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fulfillment of the Comintern&#8217;s demand for unity proved to be no simple task, however, and the history of the next three years are a complex tale of splits, mergers, secret conventions, organized caucuses, and parallel organizations that lies outside of the scope of this presentation. In outline terms, a fight erupted among the leadership of the CPA in 1920 and Ruthenberg, together with an group of his English-speaking adherents such as Isaac Ferguson and Jay Lovestone as well as the Chicago-based section of the Russian federation, exited the organization (along with a major part of the group&#8217;s funds) in April 1920 and joined with the Communist Labor Party to form the United Communist Party (UCP) in May. Wagenknecht headed this new joint organization with Ruthenberg placed in charge of the party press.  This still left a divided Communist movement, however, with the major part of the old CPA, now headed by Charles Dirba still remaining in increasingly bitter opposition. It was not until the end of 1922 &#8212; after another merger, split, and merger &#8212; that this rift was finally resolved, with the establishment with a new unified Communist Party of America and its parallel &#8220;Legal Political Party,&#8221; the Workers Party of America (WPA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During much of this complicated dance, C.E. Ruthenberg was in jail. In October of 1920, Ruthenberg was tried together with his associate Isaac Ferguson in New York for alleged violation of the state&#8217;s Criminal Anarchism law, said to have been breached by the Left Wing Section when it published Fraina&#8217;s Left Wing Manifesto the previous year. The pair were tried and sentenced to 5 years&#8217; confinement in the State Penitentiary on October 29, 1920. The pair sat in Dannemora Prison until finally released on a $5,000 bond on April 24, 1922. Ruthenberg was immediately made Executive Secretary of the WPA upon his release on bail, with Abram Jakira in charge of daily operations of the parallel and underground CPA. The above ground WPA headed by Ruthenberg grew rapidly, boosted by the addition of the massive Finnish Federation to its ranks, while the underground party withered and died, put to bed for good in 1923. Thereafter Ruthenberg was the sole Executive Secretary of the American Communist Party (still calling itself the Workers Party of America) &#8212; a position which he retained for the rest of his life, despite spending much of the 1920s as a leader of a minority faction within the party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Criminal Anarchism convictions of Ruthenberg and Ferguson were ultimately overturned by the New York Supreme Court In July of 1922, just in time for another round of prosecutions, this time related to ill-fate August 1922 Unity Convention of the CPA held at Bridgman, Michigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 1922 Bridgman Convention</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A secret conclave had been arranged at the Wolfskeel Resort on the wooded shore of Lake Michigan to finally unite the CPA with a parallel organization maintained by its dissident Central Caucus faction. The site was regarded as relatively safe, having previously been used for a secret convention of the United Communist Party in the spring of 1920. This time, however, an informant of the US Department of Justice had managed to win election to the gathering as a delegate and the authorities had been notified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forced merger did not, however, end the rivalries between the two groups. Ruthenberg and his supporter Jay Lovestone were at odds with a rival faction led by William Z. Foster, who had strong ties to organized labor and who wanted to direct the party&#8217;s work toward organizing within the American-born working class, and James P. Cannon, who led the International Labor Defense organization.\r\nC.E. Ruthenberg, 1924</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Representatives from Ohio&#8217;s 20th Congressional District (now abolished) as the candidate of the Workers Party of America, as the CPUSA was then known, on his return to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, Comintern representative Sergei Gusev ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg&#8217;s faction; Foster complied. The factional infighting within the CPUSA did not end, however; the communist leadership of the New York locals of the International Ladies&#8217; Garment Workers&#8217; Union lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra-party factional rivalries, as neither group wanted to take the responsibility for accepting a strike settlement that appeared insufficiently revolutionary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1926&#8211;27 his First Amendment case, Ruthenberg v. Michigan, was pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court had voted 7&#8211;2 (with Brandeis joined by Holmes dissenting) against Ruthenberg. But Ruthenberg died shortly before the Court rendered its ruling, thus the opinions in the case were never published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruthenberg died in 1927 in Chicago from a ruptured appendix. He was cremated and an urn containing his ashes was placed in the Kremlin wall, not far from the burial place of his former factional rival John Reed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Writings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the head of the American Communist Party, C.E. Ruthenberg was essentially an administrator rather than a theoretician. His early journalism is scattered, he wrote relatively few pamphlets, and he published no books in his lifetime, save for a slim volume gathering his 1920 New York trial testimony with that of Isaac Ferguson, who also served as attorney in his case. A small volume of excerpts of speeches was also published by the Communist Party in 1928, shortly after his death. Nor has the CPUSA, despite Ruthenberg&#8217;s iconic status in party history, published any significant portion of his work in subsequent years. This paucity of available material has been mitigated to some extent in the internet age, with an appreciable slice of his journalism gradually becoming available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ruthenberg]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">[Submitted by Tim Davenport]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"../../../history/usa/eam/writers/ruthenberg.html\" target=\"_top\">C.

He held that the driving forces in history were science, morality and religion, but he did demonstrate the objective nature of the historical process and the role of property relations in its development. </p>\n<p>\nDuring the French Revolution, Saint-Simon was close to the Jacobins. He also participated in the War of Independence of the United States of America. He subscribed to the materialist current in the Enlightenment and opposed deism, advocating the study of nature, and was one of the first to see that politics was determined by economics and he advocated he development of the study of the laws governing history as an extension of the natural sciences.</p>\n<p>\nSaint-Simon was the major influence on his pupil <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/comte/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Auguste Comte</a>, and the sources of Comte&#8217;s ideas are visible in the <span class=\"book\">Letters</span>. While Comte was a major influence on the development of Western European philosophy through the following century, Saint-Simon&#8217;s followers degenerated into a religious sect. See <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/st-simon.htm\" target=\"_top\">Letter from Geneva</a></p>\n<p>\nOf Saint-Simon, Engels wrote in <a href=\"../../../archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</a>:\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;Saint-Simon was a son of the great French Revolution, at the outbreak of\nwhich he was not yet 30. The Revolution was the victory of the 3rd\nestate &#8211; i.e., of the great masses of the nation, <em>working</em> in\nproduction and in trade, over the privileged <em>idle</em> classes, the nobles\nand the priests. But the victory of the 3rd estate soon revealed itself\nas exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this &#8220;estate&#8221;, as the\nconquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it &#8211;\ni.e., the propertied bourgeoisie. And the bourgeoisie had certainly\ndeveloped rapidly during the Revolution, partly by speculation in the\nlands of the nobility and of the Church, confiscated and afterwards put\nup for sale, and partly by frauds upon the nation by means of army\ncontracts. It was the domination of these swindlers that, under the\nDirectorate, brought France to the verge of ruin, and thus gave Napoleon\nthe pretext for his coup d&#8217;etat.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;Hence, to Saint-Simon the antagonism between the 3rd Estate and the\nprivileged classes took the form of an antagonism between &#8220;workers&#8221; and\n&#8220;idlers.&#8221; The idlers were not merely the old privileged classes, but\nalso all who, without taking any part in production or distribution,\nlived on their incomes. And the workers were not only the wage-workers,\nbut also the manufacturers, the merchants, the bankers. That the idlers\nhad lost the capacity for intellectual leadership and political supremacy had been proved, and was by the Revolution finally settled. That the non-possessing classes had not this capacity seemed to\nSaint-Simon proved by the experiences of the Reign of Terror. Then, who was to lead and command? According to Saint-Simon, science and industry,\nboth united by a new religious bond, destined to restore that unity of\nreligious ideas which had been lost since the time of the Reformation &#8211;\na necessarily mystic and rigidly hierarchic &#8220;new Christianity.&#8221; But\nscience, that was the scholars; and industry, that was, in the first\nplace, the working bourgeois, manufacturers, merchants, bankers. These\nbourgeois were, certainly, intended by Saint-Simon to transform\nthemselves into a kind of public officials, of social trustees; but they\nwere still to hold, vis-a-vis of the workers, a commanding and\neconomically privileged position. The bankers especially were to be\ncalled upon to direct the whole of social production by the regulation\nof credit. This conception was in exact keeping with a time in which\nModern Industry in France and, with it, the chasm between bourgeoisie\nand proletariat was only just coming into existence. But what\nSaint-Simon especially lays stress upon is this: what interests him\nfirst, and above all other things, is the lot of the class that is the\nmost numerous and the most poor (&#8220;la classe la plus nombreuse et la plus\npauvre&#8221;).\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;Already in his Geneva letters, Saint-Simon lays down the proposition\nthat \"all men ought to work\". In the same work he recognizes also that\nthe Reign of Terror was the reign of the non-possessing masses.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;See,&#8221; says he to them, \"what happened in France at the time when\n your comrades held sway there; they brought about a famine.&#8221; \n </p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;But to recognise the French Revolution as a class war, and not simply\none between nobility and bourgeoisie, but between nobility, bourgeoisie,\nand the non-possessors, was, in the year 1802, a most pregnant\ndiscovery. In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of\nproduction, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by\neconomics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of\npolitical institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here\nalready very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of\npolitical rule over men into an administration of things and a direction\nof processes of production &#8211; that is to say, the \"abolition of the\nstate\", about which recently there has been so much noise.\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n&#8220;Saint-Simon shows the same superiority over his contemporaries, when in\n1814, immediately after the entry of the allies into Paris, and again in\n1815, during the Hundred Days&#8217; War, he proclaims the alliance of France\nand England, and then of both of these countries, with Germany, as the\nonly guarantee for the prosperous development and peace of Europe. To\npreach to the French in 1815 an alliance with the victors of Waterloo\nrequired as much courage as historical foresight.&#8221; \n</p>\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nAlthough the celebrated Communist MP from the 1920s, Shapurji Saklatvala (&#8216;Sak&#8217; to many) was not a foundation member of the Communist Party, he joined it within months of its establishment, after the ILP&#8217;s Annual Conference had rejected a move to affiliate to the Communist International. He remained a loyal and active member of the Communist Party until his death in 1936. </p>\n<p>\nHe was the third Indian Member of Parliament (MP) in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, after fellow Parsis Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownagree. </p>\n<p>\nSaklatvala was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, on March 28, 1874 the son of a merchant. A Parsi by background, he worked for his wealthy uncle&#8217;s firm, Tata Industries, but suffered from poor health and in October 1905 he was sent to England for medical treatment. Saklatvala became involved in left-wing politics and in 1907 he joined the SDF. Two years later he left to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and remained an active member and valued speaker across the country fro the next decade. </p>\n<p>\nSaklatvala was adopted as the parliamentary candidate for Battersea North by the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council, in June 1921. He had just resigned from the Independent Labour Party, and had joined the Communist Party. At that time it was possible to be both a member of the Communist Party and the Labour Party at the same time. There were no bans on joint membership until 1925. Shapurji Saklatvala was elected the Labour MP for Battersea North at the General Election in 1922. He lost his seat a year later, but was re-elected, this time as a Communist, at the December 1923 election. He represented the South London constituency for five years until defeated by a Labour candidate in 1929. </p>\n<p>\nThroughout all three of Saklatvala&#8217;s election campaigns, when he was the candidate of the Battersea Trades Council, the press was vitriolic in its attack on his revolutionary politics. During the 1923 campaign, Hogbin, Saklatvala&#8217;s opponent, fed information to the press&#8212;which enthusiastically followed his line&#8212;that there were &#8216;foreign gangs&#8217; operating in the constituency, with the supposed aim of breaking up Hogbin&#8217;s meetings. Hogbin referred to a gang of &#8216;Irish rebels&#8217;, including &#8216;twenty gunmen&#8217; and another of &#8216;continental and Russian communists&#8217;. </p>\n<p>\nBut it is profoundly significant that for five years, from Saklatvala&#8217;s initial adoption until 1926, there was no challenge to his candidacy from within the local Labour movement. When a challenge did come, it was in response to national influences, and not local politics, and had nothing whatsoever to do with Saklatvala&#8217;s racial origin. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough initially the local &#8216;coloured&#8217; activist John Archer and Saklatvala worked together in the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council, when the split came over the admissibility of communists, they were on different sides. Archer supported the Communists&#8217; expulsion, and when an official Trades and Labour Council was established in July 1926, became the first secretary of the North Battersea Divisional Labour Party. He campaigned against the old Trades Council and championed Saklatvala&#8217;s Labour rival at the 1929 General Election. &#8220;Although Saklatvala and Archer were non whites operating in an overwhelmingly white Labour movement, their careers in the 1920s illustrate that politics and not race was the determining factor when it came to allegiances.&#8221; </p>\n<p>\nSaklatvala faced many other pressures. His secretary, Reg Bishop, in an obituary in the <em>Daily Worker</em> wrote: &#8220;For the first year or two after his election as the MP for Battersea North, there were many who tried to get him to break from the Communist Party. The Under Secretaryship of State for India was the smallest of inducements held out if he would only be more orthodox in his politics&#8221;. </p>\n<p>\nDuring 1926 Saklatvala was a strong supporter of the miners. After one speech made in Hyde Park he urged the army not to fire on the strikers. Saklatvala was arrested and found guilty of sedition was sentenced to two months in Wormwood Scrubs Prison. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor its continued support for Saklatvala, the Battersea Labour Party and Trades Council was disaffiliated in 1926, and a few months later a new Labour Party and Trades Council was established. There was rivalry between the two organisations for a period, but by the time of the 1929 General Election the old Trades Council existed in name only. In 1927 Stephen Sanders, a long time activist in the Battersea Labour movement, was adopted as the official Labour candidate, and this effectively signalled the end of Saklatvala&#8217;s success. He lost the seat in 1929, and his vote declined even further at the election of 1931. By the time of the next General Election in 1935, in line with the Communist Party&#8217;s new strategy he urged his supporters in the constituency to vote Labour. </p>\n<p>\nSaklatvala&#8217;s socialism came about as a direct result of his opposition to colonialism. He settled in Britain from India in 1905 at the age of 30 having left India, in part, because of his brushes with the British authorities. In 1909, at Manchester, where he was working as a departmental manager for Tata&#8217;s, he joined the Independent Labour Party. From then onwards Saklatvala was to spend much of his time in pursuit of his two main concerns&#8212;socialism and anti colonialism. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough his socialist ideas, under the impact of the Russian Revolution, underwent a radical transformation, his approach to colonial freedom remained consistent. That is he constantly sought to build a united front between the workers of Britain and the forces for liberation in the colonies. This approach can be seen in one of the first Labour movement organisations to concern itself with anti-imperialism, the Workers Welfare League of India. The league was established by Saklatvala in 1917. Saklatvala was the first secretary of the League&#8217;s Indian Committee.</p>\n<p>\nA number of national Trade Unions were affiliated to it, as were numerous trade union branches. At a time when support for colonialism was strong, even amongst organised sections of the working class, the Workers Welfare League of India, strongly influenced by Saklatvala&#8217;s united front approach, made some headway in breaking down barriers between the British and Indian Labour movements. </p>\n<p>\nThe League Against Imperialism, which was not solely concerned with British colonialism, was another body that Saklatvala was to play a prominent role in. Formed in 1927, the League drew together many of the national liberation movements. At its founding Congress in Brussels in February 1927, there were 175 delegates from 37 countries. Saklatvala&#8217;s commitment to the League led to his arrest and brief.</p>\n<p>\nIn a message to the founding congress of the Communist Party of India in 1925, Saklatvala had made clear his own, and the British Party&#8217;s commitment to the building of a broad anti-colonial alliance, as the way to win self determination. In pursuit of this, he then made a widely publicised visit to India, in 1927, which lasted three months and was so successful that, on his return, the British Government denied him any future access to the country of his birth. During the visit he was given the freedom of a number of Indian cities, and granted an official welcome by the Madras and Calcutta City authorities. He met and entered into a dialogue with Gandhi, later published as a pamphlet by the British Party entitled <em>Is India Different?</em> </p>\n<p>\nSaklatvala also made contact with Communist groups that had recently been established. He also met Phil Spratt and George Allison, both members of the British Communist Party, sent work under cover to help organise the Indian trade union movement. Soon after Saklatvala&#8217;s visit Allison was deported back to England. In 1928 he was replaced by Ben Bradley, two years after the visit Bradley, Spratt and thirty one other active trade unionists were arrested. </p>\n<p>\nThey were tried at Meerut in front of an English civil servant, and after four years deliberation, the prisoners were given sentences of between three years, and transportation for life. The Meerut Conspiracy Trial received wide publicity, and because of the indignation it aroused, the sentences were later reduced, and some of the prisoners released. When Ben Bradley, whose ten year sentence was commuted, returned to England in 1933, he was met at Victoria Station by Saklatvala on behalf of the Communist Party. Continuing to play a high profile role for the Party, Shapurji Saklatvala died in 1936. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/\">Graham Stevenson</a>.</p>\n\n\n"

A socialist and a communist from a young age, Samuel became a leading figure of the British New Left and a key figure in British Marxist historiography and history-writing. His contribution to the fields of British history, British labour history, British cultural history, the history of London, historiography, the history of the British Left, the history of British Communism and  in other fields of cultural history and heritage, remain vital parts of understanding British history and British labour history since the Industrial Revolution. </p>\n<p>Samuel taught history at Ruskin College, Oxford, from 1962; a post he held until his death in 1996. In the latter part of his life Samuel was also Professor of History at the University of East London. </p>\n<p>Samuel&#8217;s left-wing politics were developed from an early age. His mother,  Minna Nerenstein, was an active member of the British Communist Party, and instilled in Samuel  left-wing principles and left-wing values, ideas that he would carry for the rest of his adult life. Samuel himself joined the CPGB as a teenager but left the Party in 1956 over the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Remaining a committed Marxist and socialist, Samuel went on to become a leading member of the New Left in Britain, and a dedicated socialist historian and socialist essayist.  </p>\n<p>Until he left the CPGB in 1956, Samuel was a member of the CPGB History Group, a section of CPGB members interested in history and historical research. Samuel always maintained that the Group was vital to the post-war explosion of British history and history-writing in general, and to his own development as a historian. Despite leaving the CPGB and the History Group in 1956, Samuel remained on friendly and comradely terms with members of the British Communist Party and the History group.  </p>\n<p>Samuel was involved in the founding of two important historical journals: <em>Past and Present</em> (founded in 1952) and <em>History Workshop Journal</em> (founded in 1976). He edited and contributed extensively to the latter, which  generated from the History Workshop Movement &#8211; a movement of historians which was established in 1967 and which was dedicated to &#8216;history from below&#8217;, social history, the history of everyday life, and people&#8217;s history. Samuel founded the journal through his activities as a tutor in history at Ruskin, which brought together professional historians, independent historians, adult education students, worker historians, trade union activists and other sections of the British Left. Like <em>Past and Present</em>, <em>History Workshop Journal</em> endures today as a vital historical journal.  </p>\n<p>Samuel wrote extensively on a variety of historical subjects, but he was particularly interested in British history and labour history. His work often connected the history of every-day working-class life with wider developments in cultural, social and political history. In later life his interests expanded and he wrote, also, on the connections between history and heritage, historiography, oral history, national history, national memories, national myths, national myth-making, patriotism, crime, culture, ideology, Left politics, Thatcherism, and the history of London and the London working-class. Key books and works of his included a study of left-wing Theatre Movements (<em>Theatres of the Left</em>), a study of crime in the East End of London (<em>East End Underworld)</em>, a study of the Miners Strike of 1984 (<em>The Enemy Within</em>), volumes on British national identity, British patriotism and British national history, and numerous volumes of working-class history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  </p>\n<p>Samuel was also highly regarded as a tutor and teacher of history, especially via his position as a tutor of history at Ruskin College. Here Samuel was involved in teaching  mostly adult education students and trade-union workers. Many of his students went on to major leadership roles in the British labour and socialist movement, and many credited him with inspiring them with a love of education and learning. His abilities as an inspirer of historical work was just as impressive as his own extensive output. Much of his later work on working-class history and working-class life, alongside several other volumes and books, remained unfinished, cut short by his early death in 1996. His educational legacy remains today in the continuing legacy of adult and worker&#8217;s education in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  Most of Samuel&#8217;s work intersected between labour history, socialist activism and education in the labour movement.   </p>\n<p>Politically after 1956, Samuel was heavily involved in the emerging New Left in Britain and wrote extensively for the New Left Review and other New Left periodicals. One of his most important historical works was a multi-part history and analysis of the British Communist Party, <em>The Lost World of British Communism</em>, which was first published in New Left Review  between 1984 and 1987. A revised and expanded version of these essays was published posthumously in book form, as <em>The Lost World of British Communism</em>, in 2006.  The essays discussed the history of British Communism but also commented on the state of British Communism and the British Left in the 1980s, prior to the CPGB&#8217;s collapse in 1991. Samuel also published extensively in other areas, outside of academic work, especially in British newspapers, specifically on British History and British left-wing politics.   </p>\n<p>Samuel was heavily supportive of most left-wing campaigns during the post-war era in Britain, from peace work to heritage. He was heavily involved in the creation of <em>The Partisan Coffee House</em>, a left-wing coffee house in Soho, London, which operated from 1958 to 1962.   </p>\n<p>Personally, Samuel was married to the writer and critic Alison Light, from 1987 to 1996. This marriage ended with Samuel&#8217;s death in 1996.  </p>\n<p>Raphael Samuel died on the 9th of December 1996. He was interred in Highgate Cemetery. Samuel&#8217;s archive of papers relating to labour history are held at Bishopsgate Library.</p>\n<p>Selected Publications: <em>Village Life and Labour</em> (1975), <em>Miners, Quarrymen and Saltworkers</em> (1977), <em>People&#8217;s History and Socialist Theory </em>(1981), <em>East End Underworld</em> (1981), <em>Culture, Ideology and Politic</em>s (1983), <em>Theatres of the Left: 1880 &#8211; 1935</em> (1985), <em>The Lost World of British Communism</em> (1986), <em>The Enemy Within: The Miners&#8217; Strike of 1984</em> (1987), <em>Patriotism: The Making and Unmaking of British National Identity </em>(1989), <em>Patriotism (Volume 2): Minorities and Outsiders</em> (1989), <em>The Myths We Live By</em> (1990),<em> Theatres of Memory: Volume 1: Past and Present in Contemporary Culture</em> (1996), <em>Theatres of Memory: Volume 2: Island Stories: Unravelling Britain</em> (1997), <em>The Lost World of British Communism </em>(2006)</p>\n\n\n"

This was an exceptional practice for the 19th century, where social codes-especially in the upper class-were of the highest importance. As a consequence Sand lost a good deal of the privileges attached to being a Baroness.

Twice this career was interrupted, once by a year of study in Berlin and the second time when Sartre was drafted in 1939 to serve in World War II. He was made captured in 1940, put in a prison, but released a year later.  </p>\n<p>\nDuring his years of teaching in Le Havre, Sartre published <span class=\"book\">Nausea</span> (1938), his first claim to fame. This novel, written in the form of a diary, narrates the feeling of revulsion that a certain Roquentin undergoes when confronted with the world of matter - not merely the world of other people but the very awareness of his own body. According to some critics, <span class=\"book\">Nausea,</span> must be viewed as a pathological case, a form of neurotic escape. Most probably it must be appreciated also as a most original, fiercely individualistic, antisocial piece of work, containing in its pages many of the philosophical themes that Sartre later developed.  </p>\n<p>\nSartre took over the phenomenological method, which proposes careful, unprejudiced description rather than deduction, from the German philosopher <a href=\"../../people/h/u.htm#husserl-edmund\">Edmund Husserl</a> and used it with great skill in three successive publications: <span class=\"book\">Imagination: A Psychological Critique</span> (1936), <span class=\"book\">Sketch for a Theory of the Emotions</span> (1939), and <span class=\"book\">L&#8217;Imaginaire</span>: <span class=\"book\">The Psychology of Imagination</span> (1940). But it was above all in <span class=\"book\">Being and Nothingness</span> (1943) that Sartre revealed himself as a master of outstanding talent. Sartre places human consciousness, or nothingness, in opposition to being, or thingness. Consciousness is not matter and by the same token escapes all determinism. The message, with all the implications it contains, is a hopeful one; yet the incessant underlining meaning that human endeavour is and remains useless makes the book tragic as well. </p>\n<p>\nHaving written his defence of individual freedom and human dignity, Sartre turned his attention to the concept of social responsibility. For many years he had shown great concern for the poor and the disinherited of all kinds. While a teacher, he had refused to wear a tie, as if he could shed his social class with his tie and thus come closer to the worker. Freedom itself, which at times in his previous writings appeared to be a gratuitous activity that needed no particular aim or purpose to be of value, became a tool for human struggle in his brochure <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Existentialism and Humanism</span></a> (1946). Freedom now implied social responsibility. In his novels and plays Sartre began to bring his ethical message to the world at large. He started a four-volume novel in 1945 under the title <span class=\"book\">Les Chemins de la libert&eacute;</span>, but after the publication of the third volume, Sartre changed his mind concerning the usefulness of the novel as a medium of communication and turned back to plays.  </p>\n<p>\nOne play followed another, and all of the plays, in their emphasis upon the raw hostility of man toward man, seem to be predominantly pessimistic; yet, according to Sartre&#8217;s own confession, their content does not exclude the possibility of a morality of salvation. Other publications of the same period include a book, <span class=\"book\">Baudelaire</span> (1947), a vaguely ethical study on the French writer and poet Jean Genet entitled <span class=\"book\">Saint Genet, Actor and Martyr</span> (1952), and innumerable articles that were published in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em>, the monthly review that Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir founded and edited. </p>\n<p>\nAfter World War II, Sartre took an active interest in French political movements, and his leanings to the left became more pronounced. He became an outspoken admirer of the Soviet Union, although he did not become a member of the Communist Party. In 1954 he visited the Soviet Union, Scandinavia, Africa, the United States, and Cuba. Upon the entry of Soviet tanks into Budapest in 1956, however, Sartre&#8217;s hopes for Communism were sadly crushed. He wrote in <em>Les Temps Modernes</em> a long article, <span class=\"book\">Le Fant&ocirc;me de Staline</span>, that condemned both the Soviet intervention and the submission of the French Communist Party to the dictates of Moscow. Over the years this critical attitude opened the way to a form of &#8220;Sartrian Socialism&#8221; that would find its expression in a new major work, <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/sartre1.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Critique of Dialectical Reason</span></a> (1960). Sartre set out to examine critically the Marxist dialectic and discovered that it did not exist in the Soviet Union, nor could it under the persecution of individual freedom. Although he still believed that Marxism was the only philosophy for the current times, he believed it had become rigid and fixed and that, instead of adapting itself to particular situations as it should, it compelled the particular to fit a predetermined universal, something directly opposed to the philosophy of Historical Materialism. Whatever its fundamental, general principles, Sartre believed that Marxism must learn to recognise the existential concrete circumstances that differ from one collectivity to another and to respect the individual freedom of man. The <span class=\"book\">Critique</span>, gained little renown, however, and a projected second volume was abandoned. Instead, Sartre prepared his autobiography (<span class=\"book\">Words</span>) for publication, for which he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for Literature, an offer that was refused.  </p>\n<p>\nCombining Existentialism with Marxism, Sartre attempted a <a href=\"../../terms/r/e.htm#revisionism\">revision</a> of Marxist theory, stating that &#8220;Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.&#8221; Sartre explained that the ultimate responsibility of all humans was first to form themselves; explaining that the effects of one&#8217;s environment and historical position were irrelevent next to the power any human has to take to their own path; and secondly that humans had a social responsibility to help society. This position, representing a view of life from a petty-bourgeois position, was directly opposed to Marx who wrote: &#8220;The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.&#8221; \n</p>\n\n<p>\nFrom 1960 until 1971 most of Sartre&#8217;s attention went into the writing of a four-volume study called <span class=\"book\">Flaubert</span>. Two volumes with a total of some 2,130 pages appeared in the spring of 1971. This huge enterprise aimed at presenting the reader with a &#8220;total biography&#8221; of Gustave Flaubert, the famous French novelist, through the use of a double tool: on the one hand, historical materialism and, on the other, <a href=\"../f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Sigmund Freud</a>&#8217;s illuminations of the dark recesses of the human soul through explorations into his childhood and family relations. Under the motto that &#8220;commitment is an act, not a word,&#8221; Sartre often went into the streets to participate in rioting, in the sale of left-wing literature, and in other activities that in his opinion were the way to promote the revolution.  </p>\n<p>\nThe enormous productivity of Sartre came herewith to a close. His mind, still alert and active, came through in interviews and in the writing of scripts for motion pictures. He also worked on a book of ethics. However, his was no longer the power of a genius in full productivity. Sartre became blind and his health deteriorated. In April 1980 he died of a lung tumour. </p>\n<p>\nSee the <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/sartre/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Jean Paul Sartre Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\r\nPolish Marxist philosopher, born in Lvov, Poland, in 1913, studied Law and Econmics at the École des Sciences Politiques et Économique in Paris, and Philosophy in Poland. </p>\r\n<p>Adam Schaff was the only Polish Marxist in the post-world war two period with an academic background. In 1945, he received a degree in philosophy at the University of Moscow and, on his return to Poland with the Red Army, and a month in the Polish underground as a member of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers Party, was given the first Polish chair in Marxist Philosophy at Warsaw University in 1948. In this position Schaff, and as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, exerted his intellectual patronage in defence of Marxist orthodoxy and was considered to be the official ideologist of the Polish Communist Party, closely following the Moscow line. Schaff took a leading role in the ideological attacks on all the non-Marxist philosophical currents existing in Poland at the time. Schaff specialised in epistemology and his principal works include <em>Concept and Word</em>, <em>Problems of the Marxist Theory of Truth</em>.</p>\r\n<p>After the death of Stalin in 1953, non-Marxist currents of philosophy Poland reasserted themselves, including the strong Polish tradition of studies in formal logic. In 1955, Schaff recognised that the source of the Marxist critique of formal logic was the ambiguous way in which it viewed contradiction: in Marxist classics contradiction simply expresses the fact that things and phenomena possess a &#8220;polar structure&#8221; that can be empirically identified, and the opposition between contrary forces and trends is the origin of movement and development. But <em>contrariety</em>, polarity, the opposition of forces or even the existence of two different aspects in an object are one thing; <em>contradiction</em>, as viewed by formal logic, is another. The confusion between contrariety and contradiction, he held, caused confusion on the part of the Marxists. This more tolerant attitude corresponded in the political sphere to the return to power of Gomulka in October, 1956, after a series of protests and strikes.</p>\r\n<p>Polish Marxism then entered a new phase. 1956 was the year in which the so-called &#8220;Marxist Revisionism&#8221; gained strength: starting with an article by Kolakowski, its main representatives were Baczko and later Schaff, who proposed a &#8220;Marxist Humanism.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Two different philosophical trends came to be formed in the Marxist environment: the &#8220;scientific&#8221; school and the &#8220;humanistic&#8221; school. For the former philosophy was knowledge of the world and thus epistemology and methodology, a science, based on specific sciences, whose concepts and methods it analysed using the tools of formal logic. For Marxists, this meant that its foundation was dialectical materialism, enriched with the methodological and logical progress made by contemporary epistemology. Marxism privileged the economic works of the mature Marx, Engels and Lenin, in order to throw light on their scientific nature and their agreement with scientific philosophy. This scientific Marxist trend, initiated by Krajewski, was heterogeneous: some saw it as mainly being based on the popularisation of Leninist and Stalinist ideas concerning dialectical materialism; others saw it as historical materialism, as a general interpretation of history, supplied by the leading role of the Communist Party; others tried to make Marxism more scientific by eliminating all its coarse, unacceptable elements and reconciling it with science, making it as rational as possible and in agreement with both common sense and the methodological requirements of contemporary epistemological (the Poznan School). </p>\r\n<p>Schaff joined this more &#8220;humanistic&#8221; or &#8220;anthropological&#8221; school initiated by Kolakowski. This school thought that philosophy should deal above all with man and human action; it was therefore inspired by the tradition of classical German philosophy and other philosophical currents as well as phenomenology and existentialism. The aspects of Marxism privileged by this school were historical materialism and human action as the creator of knowledge in relation to social context. Although Hegelianism, existentialism and phenomenology were criticised, just as the former current had criticised neo-positivism, they appreciated its methods, which they opposed to the &#8220;positivism&#8221; of the &#8220;scientific school.&#8221; They obviously preferred the works of the younger Marx, along with those of Lukacs and Gramsci, and rediscovered authors such as Brzozowski.</p>\r\n<p>Gomulka began to clamp down on this &#8220;revisionist&#8221; ferment and there was a mass purge in Poland in 1968, the year of the &#8220;Prague Spring,&#8221; and Marxists such as Kolakowski were dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>The fall of Gomulka and the rise to power of Gierek in 1970 led to a gradual &#8220;de-ideologisation&#8221; of the system. The strength of the dissidents increased even more in the late &#8216;70s with the creation of the Workers&#8217; Defence Committee (KOR) led by Jacek Kuron, which counted among its numbers eminent intellectuals, scientists, artists, priests and journalists. With the significant exception of the Poznan School, Marxism split up into a number of trends and positions linked to the personalities of individual scholars, increasingly independent of any orthodoxy and much more closely connected with European thought. Many thinkers embraced an anthropological interpretation of Marxism along the lines indicated by Schaff.</p>\r\n<p>Schaff is currently a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and a member of the Club of Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Schelling sought to answer the question of how consciousness arises out of unconscious Nature and how \"the subject\" (objective knowledge as opposed to individual consciousness) could itself become an object of knowledge.

It was through a kind of aesthetic insight that human beings could know the world beyond thought, and it was in the practical activity of natural science and social or artistic creativity that antimonies were resolved. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nFurther, Schelling rejected any idea of a finished, closed logical system.

        "content": "\r\nGerman philosopher, a product of the period of classical German philosophy (Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) who introduced elements from Eastern philosophy; the founder of <a href=\"../../terms/v/o.htm#voluntarism\">Voluntarism</a> and important precursor to Existentialism via his influence on Nietzsche and <a href=\"../f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Freudian</a> psychology; noted for his passionate hatred of <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hegel/help/hegelbio.htm\" target=\"_top\">Hegel</a>, not able to publish until anti-Hegelianism became fashionable in the 1840s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe son of a wealthy merchant who had moved to the free city of Hamburg, Schopenhauer was given a private business education. When his father died in 1805, his mother moved to Weimar, where she joined Goethe&#8217;s circle, Arthur joining her two years later, and in 1809 he entered the University of G&ouml;ttingen to study medicine. Schopenhauer immediately transferred the humanities however, to study philosophy, and in 1813, he earned a PhD from the University of Jena. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSchopenhauer spent the following winter in Weimar with Goethe where he was introduced to the Hindu scriptures by the Orientalist Friedrich Majer. Schopenhauer would say that the Upanisads, together with Plato and Kant, constituted the foundation on which he erected his own system. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1814 Schopenhauer moved to Dresden where he completed a treatise <span class=\"book\">On Vision and Colours</span> in 1816, supporting Goethe&#8217;s views on natural philosophy. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis next three years were dedicated exclusively to the preparation and composition of his main work, <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm\" target=\"_top\">The World as Will and Idea</a></span> (1819), a series of reflections on the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of nature, aesthetics, and ethics. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe work argues that appearances may be comprehended, but only with the aid of constructs of the human intellect, and, with Kant, he argues that the &#8220;thing-in-itself&#8221; remains out of view for the intellect. The &#8220;thing-in-itself&#8221; however, is the <em>Will</em>, which is given to consciousness as one&#8217;s own Will. It is the Will which is responsible for the development of order in Nature and human society, but the Will brings with it only misery and pain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe latter half of the book then deals with aesthetics and ethics, and points to the overcoming  of the will as the means of liberation from suffering. Genuine liberation results only from breaking through the bounds of individuality imposed by the ego. Whoever feels acts of compassion, selflessness, and human kindness and feels the suffering of other beings as his own is on the way to the abnegation of the will to life and the asceticism which must be the aim. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus it can be seen that Schopenhauer&#8217;s system is a kind of amalgam of Classical German Philosophy with Eastern asceticism. The book marked the summit of Schopenhauer&#8217;s thought and in the years thereafter, no further development of his philosophy occurred. Meanwhile, his <em>magnum opus</em> remained almost unread.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn March 1820, after a lengthy tour of Italy and a dispute with Hegel, he qualified to lecture at the University of Berlin. Though he remained at the university for 24 semesters, only his first lecture was actually held, for he continued to schedule his lectures at the same hour when Hegel was lecturing to a large and ever-growing audience. Even his book received scant attention. In 1825, he made one last attempt to find a publisher in Berlin, but in vain. He renounced his career as a university professor and lived henceforth as a recluse, totally absorbed in his studies, especially in the natural sciences. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe second edition of <span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm\" target=\"_top\">The World as Will and Idea</a></span> (1844) included an additional volume. Three publishers rejected the work, until an obscure Berlin bookseller accepted the manuscript without remuneration. However, Schopenhauer eventually achieved the recognition he desired and a third edition of <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/schopenh.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">The World as Will and Idea</span></a>, containing an exultant preface, appeared in 1859 and, in 1860, a second edition of his <span class=\"book\">Ethics</span>. After Schopenhauer&#8217;s sudden and painless death, Julius Frauenst&auml;dt published his complete works in six volumes. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring this time, the actual impact and influence of Schopenhauer began to spread. By turning away from spirit and reason to the powers of intuition, creativity, and the irrational, his thought has influenced via <a href=\"../../people/n/i.htm#nietzsche-friedrich\">Nietzsche</a>, the ideas of vitalism, Dilthey&#8217;s life philosophy, Existentism, anthropology, and through Eduard von Hartmann&#8217;s philosophy of the unconscious, the psychology of <a href=\"../../people/f/r.htm#freud-sigmund\">Sigmund Freud</a>. Schopenhauer&#8217;s influence on music and literature can be seen in the work of Richard Wagner and Thomas Mann.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em>\r\nSee the article on the period after Hegel&#8217;s death: <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/hegel/help/1841.htm\" target=\"_top\">1841</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His father died when he was three, leaving his mother to support four children by taking in washing.  Shliapnikov completed primary school at age eleven and started factory work at age thirteen; he worked as an apprentice in Murom and Sormovo factories.  In 1901, he became an apprentice mechanic at a St. Petersburg metalworking factory, but was fired and blacklisted after taking part in a strike.  He returned to Murom, where he worked in a factory, improved his metalworking skills, and conducted illegal revolutionary agitation and organization.  He became a member of the RSDLP in 1901 and after the party split in 1903, he joined the Bolsheviks. </p>\r\n<p>From 1904 to 1907, Shliapnikov spent a total of two years in jail or prison.  In January 1908, he left Russia for Western Europe.  From 1908 to 1916, he worked in French, German, and English factories, becoming a highly accomplished master of metalworking, participated in Bolshevik party politics, helped organize trade unions, and published newspaper and journal articles about industrial work and trade union organization.  During World War I, he served as the chief organizational link between the Bolshevik central committee abroad and Bolsheviks within Russia. </p>\r\n<p>Shliapnikov led the bureau of the Bolshevik central committee in Petrograd in early 1917.  During the February Revolution, he helped organize the Petrograd Soviet of Workers&#8217; Deputies and was a member of its executive committee.  He favored formation of a revolutionary provisional government through negotiations with other left socialist parties in the soviet, but did not support the immediate violent overthrow of the provisional government.  In 1917, he helped organize the Petrograd and All-Russian Metalworkers&#8217; Unions and was elected chair of both; he remained chair of the All-Russian Metalworkers&#8217; Union until May 1921. Shliapnikov supported the Bolshevik seizure of power on behalf of the soviet in October 1917.  He served as Commissar of Labor until fall 1918.  During the civil war, he held important posts on the Caspian-Caucasian and Western fronts.  </p>\r\n<p>In fall 1919, Shliapnikov first began to express disagreements with Communist party policy on trade unions.  His theses proposing trade union control of industry and &#8220;workerization&#8221; of leading party organs were presented to the Ninth Party Congress in March 1920.  Those who supported his views came to be called the &#8220;Workers&#8217; Opposition.&#8221;  Alexandra Kollontai joined in late 1920.   When the trade union debate was opened in December 1920, Shliapnikov led the &#8220;Workers&#8217; Opposition&#8221; in trying to elect to the Tenth Party Congress delegates who would vote for their theses (published in &#8220;Pravda&#8221; on January 25, 1921).  The Workers&#8217; Opposition was only a small minority at the congress (held in March 1921), where Kollontai&#8217;s famous pamphlet about the Workers&#8217; Opposition caused a stir.  The congress censured the Workers&#8217; Opposition and banned factionalism within the party, but Shliapnikov was elected to the party central committee and several other important posts.  He and his supporters continued to struggle for their views, adapting them to new conditions under NEP, and they presented a letter to the Comintern in 1922 criticizing the suppression of dissent within the Russian Communist Party.  At the Eleventh Party Congress in March-April 1922, Shliapnikov and others narrowly escaped expulsion from the party for their petition to the Comintern.  </p>\r\n<p>After 1922, Shliapnikov continued to participate in internal party politics, but to little effect.  He turned to writing and publishing his memoirs of the revolutionary movement, including in them oblique messages to workers about the importance of organizing themselves without depending on party intellectuals.  He briefly worked at the Soviet diplomatic mission in Paris in 1924-25.  From 1927 to 1929, he was chair of Metalloimport and in 1932-33 worked in Gosplan RSFSR.  He was investigated several times for oppositional activities in the 1920s and early 1930s, although he never joined Trotsky, Zinoviev, or any other top party leaders in any of the various large oppositions. In 1932, he was forced to publish a confession of having committed errors in his memoirs of 1917.  In 1933, he was purged from the Communist Party, in 1934 exiled briefly to the Russian north, in 1935 arrested and in 1937 executed.  He was rehabilitated of criminal charges in 1963 and restored to membership in the Communist Party in 1988.</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">Contributed by Barbara C.

        "content": "\nCzech economist and politician. He was the man behind the 1968 economic liberalization plan and was one of the key figures in the Prague Spring.</p>\n<p>&#352;ik was born in the industrial town of Plze&#328;, Czechoslovakia. Before the Second World War &#352;ik studied Art at Charles University of Prague, and studied politics after the war.</p>\n<p>Following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and the partition of the whole nation in March 1939, &#352;ik joined the Czech Resistance movement. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 and sent to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. At Mauthausen &#352;ik&#8217;s fellow inmates included Antonín Novotný, the future president of Czechoslovakia who was succeded by the leader of the Prague Spring Alexander Dub&#269;ek, and Dubcek&#8217;s father, Stefan.</p>\n<p>The connections that &#352;ik made at Mauthausen proved useful in his post-war political career. In the early 1960s he attempted to persuade the harline president, Novotný, into loosening his rigid adherence to central planning, which had been crippling the economy. &#352;ik, who by this point was an economics professor and member of the Communist party, wanted to bring market elements into central planning, to relax price controls and to promote private enterprise in the hope of kick-starting the stagnant economic climate. It was around this point that &#352;ik was elected to the party&#8217;s central committee and was made head of the economics institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>&#352;ik&#8217;s reforms were launched in 1967, before Dub&#269;ek came to power, bet were heavily watered down by party apparatchiks who worried about losing control of the factories. The only palpable, and certainly the most popular, result of the reforms was the appearance of private taxis on the streets of Prague. In December 1967, at a party meeting that was a precursor to Dub&#269;ek&#8217;s coup a month later, &#352;ik publicly denounced Novotný&#8217;s regime. He demanded a fundamental change to the Communist system and a new leadership, two decades before Mikhail Gorbachev he announced that economic reform could not be separated from fundamental political change. By this point Czechoslovakia had the lowest living standards in the Soviet bloc, whereas previously it had been the economic backbone of the Habsburg empire.</p>\n<p>Following Dub&#269;ek&#8217;s successful coup, &#352;ik was made a deputy prime minister in April 1968 and he was the architect of the economics section of Dub&#269;ek&#8217;s action programme. &#352;ik claimed that if his policies were followed then Czechoslovakia would be on an economic par with neighbouring Austria within four years. However these plans were never followed out after the Prague Spring was brutally ended in August of the same year by the tanks of the Red army.</p>\n<p>When the tanks rolled into Prague &#352;ik was on holiday in Yugoslavia, with the threat of arrest looming he never returned to his homeland. Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet Communist Party&#8217;s propaganda machine singled &#352;ik out for particular attention. In August 1968 TASS issued a press release calling him an agent of U.S. imperialism and &#8220;one of the most odious figures of the right-wing revisionists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#352;ik left Yugoslavia in October 1968 and moved to Switzerland. He became an economic professor at the University of St. Gallen in 1970, he held the post until he retired in 1990. Even after the Velvet Revolution &#352;ik never returned to the Czech Republic, he became a Swiss citizen and lived there until his death.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/sik/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Ota &#352;ik Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

His most famous books is <em>The Jungle</em> (1906), which brought about a government investigation of the meatpacking plants of Chicago, and change in the food laws. </p>\n<p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a liquor salesman and drank himself to death; his mother came from a relatively wealthy family. When Sinclair was ten, the family moved to New York, and he started to write dime novels at the age of 15. In 1897 he enrolled Columbia University, while producing one poorly paid novelette per week. </p>\n<p>By 1904 Sinclair was moving toward a realistic fiction. He read Socialist classics and became a regular reader of the <em><a href=\"../../../history/usa/pubs/appeal-to-reason/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Appeal to Reason</a></em>, a socialist-populist weekly. He was never a Communist, but he was often portrayed as a violent revolutionary. In 1934 he resigned from the Socialist Party. </p>\n<p>He gained fame in 1906 with <em><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/sinclair-upton/works/jungle/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Jungle</a></em>, a report on the dirty conditions in the Chicago meat-packing industry. Jurgis Rudkus, the protagonist, is a young Lithuanian immigrant. He arrives in America dreaming of wealth, freedom, and opportunity. Jurgis finds work from the flourishing, filthy Chicago stockyards. First he likes his work, and is astonished when his comrades hate it. Gradually his optimistic world vision fade in the hopeless &#8220;wage-slavery&#8221; and in the chaos of urban life, and he becomes a criminal, and then a Socialist. </p>\n<p>The book won Sinclair fame and fortune, and led to the implementation of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. It had the deepest social impact since Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s <em>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</em>. President Theodore Roosevelt received 100 letters a day demanding reforms in the meat industry and Sinclair was called to the White House. The proceeds of the book enabled Sinclair to establish and support the socialist commune Helicon Home Colony in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/sinclair-upton/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Upton Sinclair Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n"

He was prominent as an elected official in Finland, as minster of foreign affairs in the 1918 Finnish revolutionary government, as a founder of the Communist Party of Finland, and as a functionary of the Communist International.</p>\n<p>Born November 8, 1876 the son of a minister, Yrjö Elias Sirola graduated from university in 1896 and went to work as a school teacher in Finland.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n1\">[1]</a></sup> He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1903 and served as an editor of the <em>Kansan Lehti</em> (&#8220;Newspaper of the People&#8221;) from 1904 to 1906 and as an editor of the Helsinki <em>Työmies</em> (&#8220;Workman&#8221;) from 1906. In 1905, Sirola was appointed as Secretary of the SDP, a role which enabled him to play an active part in the general strike of that year.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n2\">[2]</a></sup> Sirola also wrote several books on social and political themes and translated works by August Strindberg and Karl Kautsky to Finnish.</p>\n<p>Sirola was elected as a member of the parliament from the SDP from 1907 to 1909. He was forced into emigration by the Tsarist government, however, landing in America. There he worked as a professor of social science at the Finnish Socialist Federation&#8217;s Work People&#8217;s College in Smithville, Minnesota.</p>\n<p>The March 1917 Revolution in Russia brought Sirola home to his motherland, where he again served as a Social Democratic parliamentary deputy in 1917 and 1918. He was a leader of the radical left wing of the party who supported the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 1917 and who sought to emulate Lenin&#8217;s results in Finland.</p>\n<p>On November 11, 1917, Sirola arrived in Petrograd with his comrade Evert Huttunen, where he met with Lenin at Smolnyi about how radicals in Finland might aid the Bolshevik uprising and about revolutionary prospects in Finland.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n3\">[3]</a></sup> Lenin was fearful that troops loyal to the Provisional Government of Alexander Kerensky would be pulled from Finland to crush the Bolshevik uprising. He urged the Finns to initiate a general strike in an effort to emulate the Bolsheviks in their seizure of power.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n4\">[4]</a></sup> Sirola and Huttunen took the opposite impression from this meeting with Lenin than the one which the Russian leader had intended, however, interpreting the Bolshevik grip on power as being extremely tenuous and believing it dangerous for the Finnish SDP to build its plans around the survival of the Bolshevik government.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n5\">[5]</a></sup> This cautious perspective was shared by the SDP&#8217;s parliamentary group, but radicals in the party pushed the revolution forward nonetheless, calling a general strike for November 14. Sirola was one of three SDP leaders to exercise general control over the strike arrangements.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>As one historian has noted:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;The instructions for the conduct of the strike required that in each community a revolutionary council would be set up with full authority over all workers&#8217; organizations, above all the Red Guard, which was to be the executive arm of the workers&#8217; power. The Red Guard would work with the militia in keeping order, mount guards and patrols, arrest dangerous enemies of the workers, confiscate liquor stocks, and stop the spread of rumors. The instruction ended with the standard injunction that &#8216;during the general strike, order and discipline must be preserved irreproachably. It must be remember that revolution is not the same as outrage and anarchy.&#8217;&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Each community experienced the general strike that launched the Finnish Revoluionary Government in a different way, ranging from complete inaction to Red Guards nailing shut the doors of stubborn businessmen who defied the strike.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n8\">[8]</a></sup> The success of the action generated pressure among the working class to move to a full seizure of power in emulation of the Bolshevik seizure of power a week earlier.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n9\">[9]</a></sup> Sirola still held that the armed seizure of power was premature, however. He argued at a meeting of the SDP&#8217;s Revolutionary Council convened in the early morning hours of November 16 that &#8220;the position in Russian and the eventual attack of the Germans&#8221; was decisive and that the prudent course of action was to pressure parliament into making concessions, guaranteeing action on food and granting and back wages to those who participated in the general strike action.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n10\">[10]</a></sup> The parliamentary delegates taking such a cautious position were in a minority, however, and at 5:00 am the Revolutionary Council voted 14-11 in favor of seizing power.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n11\">[11]</a></sup> The Revolutionary Council was reorganized, with Sirola and the parliamentary group (the minority) refusing to take part. Two hours later their nerve of the majority failed them, however, and the newly reorganized Revolutionary Council backed away from armed insurrection, in favor of an aggressive push for concessions from the bourgeois parties.</p>\n<p>As Anthony Upton notes:</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;In effect Sirola had won and emerged as the leading figure on the morning of 16 November; his policy, that of stepping up the pressure until they got a government that would satisfy the basic demands on food and guarantee immunity from reprisal, was adopted. On his suggestion, they decided to take over the railways, close the law courts, and compel all the agencies of central and local government to cease activity... There was also an attempt to satisfy the restlessness of the Red Guard by assigning to it a new task: It was to begin systematic searches for hidden stocks of food, if possible with the authorization of local Food Boards, but if necessary without...&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<p>On their own authority the Red Guard began arresting and jailing bourgeois notables, however, and the drive towards revolution careened forwards. On November 18, a group of angry railway workers came to see the SDP leaders, telling party leader Kullervo Manner to his face &#8220;you have betrayed the workers, the strike must go on until a socialist government is established.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n13\">[13]</a></sup> The Strike Committee met that same night and declared in favor of a socialist government and that the Red Guard must stay armed until this was achieved and &#8220;all power is taken into the workers&#8217; hands.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n14\">[14]</a></sup> The conservative government headed by P.E. Svinhufvud refused to make concessions to the socialist opposition, with parliament voting down proposals to lower the voting age and to grant the vote immediately to tenant farmers. A new cabinet was put together by Svinhufvud which did not include a single socialist, a body confirmed by parliament on November 24 by a vote of 100 to 80.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n15\">[15]</a></sup> Parliamentary maneuvering was met with spontaneous armed actions by Red Guard in various localities in which some 34 people were killed, mostly victims of Red Guard violence. This increasing hostility created an impenetrable barrier between the two sides. With the conservative parliamentary majority intent upon disarming the Red Guards and establishing a monarchical form of government, the nation descended into civil war.</p>\n<p>On January 19, 1918, a pitched battle broke out between Red Guards and the conservative Protective Corps of Viipuri, which Russian troops coming to the aid of their allies in the fight. <sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n16\">[16]</a></sup> Fighting spread with the Red Guards beginning the seizure of Helsinki on the night of January 27/28.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n17\">[17]</a></sup> White forces headed by General Carl Mannerheim controlled the northernmost five-sixths of Finland, while the Reds controlled the Southernmost region, containing approximately half of the country&#8217;s population and including the cities of Pori, Turku, Tampere, Riihimäki, Helsinki, Kotka, and Viipuri.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n18\">[18]</a></sup> A Finnish Revolutionary Government was declared, in which Sirola served as Commissar of Foreign Affairs.</p>\n<p>The civil war proved to be a one-sided affair, with the superior officer corps and materiel of the White forces under Mannerheim winning the day. By the spring of 1918, with the Red government clearly on the road to military defeat at the hands of the Whites, Sirola coordinated the evacuation of the leadership of the revolutionary government. On April 7, a meeting of Finnish socialists took place in Petrograd, at which various settlement plans were discussed, with Sirola setting up an office in Petrograd to look after the refugees already beginning to arrive three days later.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n19\">[19]</a></sup> Evacuation became official policy on April 14, 1918. Historian Anthony Upton notes</p>\n<p class=\"quoteb\">&#8220;The choices before the socialist leaders were unconditional surrender, a glorious fight to the finish in Finland ending in almost certain martyrdom, or a prudent withdrawal with a view to a future return. It was not a difficult choice to make, and did not mean, as their detractors had always claimed, that they were weak and cowardly men who betrayed their faithful but deluded followers. They were Marxists, and could see their defeat as only an episode in the class war, which always continued, and their duty was not to indulge in glorious gestures of defiance, but to persevere in the struggle.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n20\">[20]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Finnish Socialist Republic finally fell on May 15, 1918.</p>\n<p>Sirola was involved in establishing the Finnish Communist Party at the end of August 1918 in Moscow.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n21\">[21]</a></sup> The governing Central Committee of this new organization established itself in Petrograd, where it launched a daily newspaper and magazines in Finnish and Swedish and put into print over 40 pamphlets during its first year.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n22\">[22]</a></sup> Underground organizations of this new party were established inside Finland, where they distributed literature and conducted propaganda work.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n23\">[23]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1919, he was the Finnish CP&#8217;s signatory to the call for the formation of the Communist International and in March of that year he was a delegate to the founding convention, held early in March 1919.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n24\">[24]</a></sup> At the founding convention of the Comintern, Sirola delivered the report on the Finnish revolution:</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Although not adequately prepared politically or militarily for such a struggle, the workers held their ground at the front for three months, while at the same time doing a great deal behind the lines to organize social and economic life.</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;That first revolution by the Finnish proletariat was defeated. The willingness to sacrifice and the courage of the comrades, men and women, who fought in the Red Guard and the invaluable aid given by our Russian comrades were not enough to repel the onslaught launched by the international gangs of White Guards led by Finnish, Swedish, German, and Russian officers. At the end of April, German imperialism tipped the balance by committing regular army troops to the fight. The White Guards were then able to block the plan to evacuate the revolution&#8217;s best surviving forces to Russia.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n25\">[25]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the wake of the Finnish uprising and its bloody aftermath, in which over 11,000 prisoners of the victorious Whites died of starvation, disease, or execution,<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n26\">[26]</a></sup> Sirola had clearly cast his lot with revolutionary methods as opposed to parliamentarism:</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;For too long, we...were imbued with the ideology of a &#8216;united&#8217; workers&#8217; movement. Only after the revolution did the split become unavoidable. There was a sharp polarization. The bourgeois dictatorship in Finland gave the extreme right wing of the old Social Democracy &#8216;freedom&#8217; of organization and of the press for the express purpose of pacifying the workers. These traitors did their best to defeat the revolution the Finnish proletariat had made the previous year and to propagandize for a peaceful workers&#8217; movement functioning through parliament, trade unions, and cooperatives.... But the admonitions of those bourgeois lackeys are alien to the masses, who are tormented by prison, hunger, and poverty. The workers&#8217; memories of the White Terror are still fresh, and they can see the living example of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n27\">[27]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sirola also represented the Finnish party at the meetings of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). While he was not a delegate to the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in 1920, he did attend the 3rd World Congress in 1921 and in June 1922 took part in the 2nd Enlarged Plenum of ECCI.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n28\">[28]</a></sup> People&#8217;s Commissar of Education in the Soviet Republic of Karelia, close to the Finnish border.</p>\n<p>Sirola was a representative of the Communist International to the US Communist Party from 1925 to 1927, replacing Sergei Gusev.

In 1992 an adapted form of his &#8220;Sunset Clause&#8221; document, allowing for a form of power sharing with the government, was adopted by the NWC.</p>\n<p>Slovo loved classical music, particularly the work of Mahler, and his favourite book was Gogol&#8217;s &#8220;Dead Souls&#8221;.

Smith saw labour as the sole source and <em>measure</em> of value:\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\nLabour is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities. The real price of everything, what everything costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What everything is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who want to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. ... Labour alone, therefore, never varying its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all time and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">\n<span class=\"book\"><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Wealth of Nations</a></span>, 1776\n</p>\n<p>Adam Smith first formulated the view that the value of goods was\ndetermined not by their use value but by their exchange value. According\nto this concept, the market price adjusts to the cost price. Adam Smith opposed state intervention\n(tariffs, import or export barriers, etc.). His theory of free trade represented the rising bourgeois class, against the backwards feudalist mentality heralded by the old aristocracy. He was\na major influence on economic policy in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n</p>\n<p>\nA life-long friend of David Hume and part of the &quot;Scottish Enlightenment&quot;, Smith was also acquainted with Voltaire and others of the French Enlightenment. Smith explained that he came to the theory of political economy expressed in <span class=\"book\">The Wealth of Nations</span> from a study of &quot;human nature&quot; and consideration of how the innate passions of human beings became transformed into socially productive cooperation in <em>laissez faire</em> capitalism. He developed a &quot;four stage&quot; theory of history tracing how social institutions respond to development of the productive forces and culminate in pre-Industrial Revolution capitalism. Consistent with the theory of knowledge of David Hume, Smith regards value to be exclusively the product of human labour, which in turn has its source in human nature. The institutions of society and the division of labour arise historically independently of the will and understanding of human beings, but as the natural outcome of the clash of their individualism. Smith wrote in the very earliest days of the industrial revolution, but it was not the large, industrial enterprises which formed the context of his thinking, but rather, Smith was a representative of the small-scale manufacturer of the early eighteenth century. </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em> See: </em> <strong><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/smith-adam/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Adam Smith Reference Archive </a></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n"

His family moved to Germany when he was three. His uncle, Friedrich Adolph Sorge, had been a secretary for Karl Marx. </p>\n<p>In October 1914, Sorge volunteered to service in the World War One. He joined a student battalion of the 3rd Guards, Field Artillery. He was severely wounded in March 1916 on the Western Front, leaving him with a lifelong limp. He was discharged with Iron Cross. </p>\n<p>During his convalescence he read Marx and became a Communist. He spent the rest of the war studying economics in universities of Berlin, Kiel and Hamburg. In 1920 he graduated with a Ph. D. in political science. He also joined the German Communist Party [KPD]. His political views, however, got him fired from both a teaching job and coal mining work. He fled to Moscow where he became a junior agent for Comintern. </p>\n<p>In 1921 he returned to Germany, married Christiane Gerlach, former wife of Kurt Gerlach, Director of the Frankfurt Institut, and moved to Solingen, in Westphalia. In 1922 the Comintern relocated him to Frankfurt where he gathered intelligence about business community while assisting at the Frankfurt Institut building the library. After the failed coup in October 1923 he continued his work as a journalist. </p>\n<p>In 1924, he was recalled to Moscow and divorced Christiane, and officially joined the International Liaison Department of Comintern, OMS, an arm of the GPU. In 1928, he was transferred to GPU duties and assigned to Shanghai in 1930. Officially he was editor of German news service and for the <em>Frankfurter Zeitung</em>. There he met Ozaki Hozumi, a Japanese journalist working for Asahi Shimbun. In January 1932 Sorge reported on fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in the streets of Shanghai. In December he was recalled to Moscow. </p>\n<p>Sorge was decorated and remarried. In 1933 he was sent to Berlin with the code name &#8220;Ramsey&#8221;, to re-establish contacts in Germany so that he could pass for a German journalist in Japan. He arrived to Yokohama on September 6, 1933. </p>\n<p>1933-1934 Sorge built a network to collect intelligence for NKVD in Japan. His agents had contacts with senior politicians and through that, to information of Japan&#8217;s foreign policy. He also recontacted Ozaki Hozumi who developed a close contact with the prime minister Fumimaro Konoye. Ozaki copied secret documents for Sorge. </p>\n<p>Officially Sorge joined the Nazi party and worked with the local embassy and ambassador Eugen Ott as an agent for Abwehr. He used the embassy for double-checking his information. </p>\n<p>Sorge supplied the Soviet Union with information about Anti-Comintern Pact, the German-Japanese Pact and warned of Pearl Harbor attack. In 1941 Sorge informed the Soviet Union of Hitler&#8217;s intentions to invade the Soviet Union. No action was taken on Sorge&#8217;s advice. </p>\n<p>Before the battle for Moscow, Sorge transmitted information that Japan was not going to attack Soviet Union in the East. This information allowed Zhukov to redeploy Siberian troops for the defense of Moscow. </p>\n<p>Japanese secret service had already intercepted many of his messages and begun to close in. Ozaki was arrested in October 14 and interrogated. Sorge was arrested in October 18 in Tokyo. Sorge was not exchanged for Japanese prisoners of war. Both Ozaki and Sorge were hanged on October 9 1944. The Soviet Union did not acknowledge Sorge until 1964. </p>\n\n\n"

Huxley, Beatrice Webb and <a href=\"../../people/m/i.htm#mill-john-stuart\">J.S. Mill</a> and in 1851 he published <span class=\"book\">Social Statics</span>, arguing for an extreme form of economic and social laissez-faire. Coming into money in 1853, Spencer resigned his position with <em>The Economist</em> to devote himself to writing and publishing his own work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1860 he published <span class=\"book\">The Principles of Psychology</span> which he saw as part of his <em>magnum opus</em>, <span class=\"book\">The Synthetic Philosophy</span>, which was to integrate the natural sciences in a single sythetic system along with ethics and pscyhlogy and sociology at the centre. A number of volumes of the projected work appeared over the next 20 years, but the project was never completed, with his views becoming increasingly out of step with the dominant currents of thinking after the 1860s. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDespite Spencer's efforts to separate himself from his Positivist rival, Comte, as set out in <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/spencer.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Reasons for Dissenting from M. Comte</span></a>, there is a clear similarity in their views: an evolutionary view of social progress through various stages, with natural science providing the solution to man's problems and sociology emerging as the supreme science of sciences. The specific character of Spencer's positivism is his championing of <em>individualism</em>. When Darwin published his <span class=\"book\">Origins of Species</span> in 1859, Spencer accepted Darwin's theory of natural selection, and it was Spencer in fact who coined the term &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221;. Spencer foresaw a future epoch of unfettered individualism arising only after overcoming a period of War and Socialism, in which the unwarranted interference of the State in the natural evolution of society would be transcended.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpencer was the pioneer of the method of social theory which formulated general principles held to be laws of nature, and then justified propositions about social development and history on the basis of the said natural laws. For example, Spencer held that there was a fundamental law called &#8220;the law of the persistence of force&#8221; which caused continual change in organisms, &#8220;the law of the multiplication of effects,&#8221; which brought about greater diversity and ultimately an individualist society. Spencer took this as far as parallels between transport and other communication systems and the veins and nerve systems of animals.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Showed how human freedom is possible within bounds of necessity, and in solving this problem built his theory on proposition that only &quot;nature&quot; exists, being the &quot;cause of itself&quot; (<em>causa sui</em>). This &quot;creative nature&quot; he called &quot;Substance&quot;; substance had the properties of both extension (i.e. spatial existence) and thought and many modes, including &quot;thought&quot; as one of these &quot;modes&quot;. This contrasted with the <strong>Dualism</strong> of both Descartes especially, and the <a href=\"../../terms/e/m.htm#empiricism\">Empiricists</a> who were left with the seemingly insoluble problem of explaining how it was that <em>thought reflected matter</em>. Spinoza did not publish his main work, <span class=\"book\">Ethics</span>, for fear of repression.  <em>Further Reading:</em> Ilyenkov's <a href=\"../../../archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essay2.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Essays from the History of Dialectics</span></a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBenedicto Spinoza was born in Amsterdam in 1632 of Portuguese Jewish parents who had fled to the religious freedom of the Dutch Republic of Jan de Witt. In July 1656, young Bento was the leader of a philosophical discussion group which included members of the more liberal-minded Protestant sects, and was expelled from the local Jewish community for his heretical views. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nDescartes' works were widely discussed in the Netherlands at that time, though Cartesian views were proscribed by the Church, and the young Spinoza was clearly influenced by Descartes. Spinoza probably attended lectures in Cartesian philosophy in Leiden between 1656 and 1659. In 1663 he published a &quot;geometrical&quot; version of Descartes Principles of Philosophy (i.e., a version rendering Descartes' work into the form of axioms and theorems). However, Spinoza had already sharply departed from Descartes' view. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpinoza denied the immortality of the soul, and believed in a God who <em>manifests</em> himself only in the laws of Nature, rather than in a anthropomorphic entity which <em>creates</em> nature. In reading Spinoza, it is probably correct to substitute the word &quot;<em>Nature</em>&quot; wherever the word &quot;<em>God</em>&quot; is written. This view is, in fact, a world-view which would be shared by large numbers of scientifically-minded people today. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpinoza was intensely interested in natural science, corresponding with Robert Boyle (the founder of the physics of fluids), Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society in respect of Descartes' theory of comets and planets, Huygens on the wave properties of light including his own experiments with lenses and was widely read in physics, astronomy, chemistry and anatomy. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1665, Spinoza laid aside his work on the <span class=\"book\">Ethics</span>, to write a book defending freedom of speech and religion against the 'strict' Calvinists. The <span class=\"book\">Treatise on Theology and Politics</span> asserted that the Bible should not be regarded as containing scientific or philosophical truth, but was the work of human beings and should be regarded as an historical document, which teaches obedience to a certain moral code. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Calvinists were furious, to say the least. The Synod of South Holland referred to the <span class=\"book\">Treatise</span> as an 'evil and blasphemous book' and it was anonymously described as 'spawned in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil'. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the French invaded the Republic, and Jan de Witt was beaten to death by a Calvinist mob in The Hague, Spinoza had to keep a low profile. The <span class=\"book\">Ethics </span>was completed in 1675, but it was not published until after Spinoza's death in 1677. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpinoza's principal amendment to Descartes' theory was that he eliminates the problem of the &quot;coordination&quot; of extension-less thought and unconscious matter (Descartes' &quot;dualism&quot;) by proposing a world made up of &quot;Substance&quot; which has attributes of both extension and thought. Thus &quot;Nature thinks itself&quot;, and the problem of &quot;coordination&quot; does not arise. Spinoza was thus the first to offer a solution to the &quot;subject-object&quot; problem, the first &quot;Monist&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFurther, Spinoza is a <a href=\"../../terms/r/a.htm#rationalism\">Rationalist</a>, in the sense that he appeals to the &quot;clear light of Reason&quot; rather than to the evidence of the senses, and a Logicist in that he proposes that any theory should be developed by formal-logical proof from axioms, modelled on the only science to have by then achieved the status of genuine science - <em>geometry</em>, and mathematics in general. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpinoza must be regarded as a <a href=\"../../terms/m/a.htm#materialism\">Materialist</a>, as for him thought is but an attribute of objectively existing Substance; Substance may or may exhibit the attribute of thought. In line with the development of positive science at that time, his view of the material world is exclusively <a href=\"../../terms/m/e.htm#mechanical-materialism\">Mechanical</a>, and the world unfolds with determined necessity. Human freedom is expressed by the fact that through knowledge of God (i.e. Nature and its laws) - people are conscious agents, participants in events, not subject to &quot;outside&quot; events. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpinoza was a contemporary of the British <a href=\"../../terms/e/m.htm#empiricism\">Empiricists</a>, Hobbes and Locke; his predecessors were Descartes and Galileo; Isaac Newton was a young man when Spinoza died of consumption in 1677. Although he is in many ways 250 years ahead of his time, Spinoza's work remained more or less obscure until the great German poet, Goethe, promoted and extended Spinoza's naturalistic, &quot;pantheistic&quot; views in the late eighteenth century, and Haeckel and Einstein were among his admirers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/spinoza/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Spinoza Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../s.htm\">Index of the Letter S</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n"

Son of a shoe maker, he joined\nthe <a href=\"../../orgs/r/u.htm#rsdlp\">Social Democratic party</a> after being expelled from a theological school for insubordination. After the RSDLP split in 1903, Stalin became a member of the <a href=\"../../orgs/b/o.htm#bolshevik\">Bolshevik</a> party.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Stalin's early years he was continually in trouble with the local authorities. During this period he took the nickname Koba, after the famous Georgian outlaw and the name of a character in the romance \"Nunu\", by the Georgian author Kazbek. The celebrated brigand Koba was known as a fighter for the the rights of the people, while the fictional Koba was depicted as sacrificing everything in his struggle against the Tsarist authorities on behalf of his people, but unsuccesful, freedom was lost. \n</p>\n<p>\nKoba escaped prison exile several times, at his last escape he fled to St. Petersburg, where he became a member of the editorial staff of <a href=\"../../periodicals/p/r.htm#pravda\">Pravda</a> in 1912. Within a year, Stalin was arrested again and exiled to Siberia. He was released from exile by general amnesty after the February Revolution of 1917, and went back to the editorial staff of Pravda in <a href=\"../../places/p/e.htm#petrograd\">Petrograd</a>.  \n</p>\n<p>\nAfter the <a href=\"../../events/o/c.htm#october\">October Revolution</a> Stalin was elected to the post of commissar for nationalities.\n</p>\n<p>\nThroughout the following civil war, Stalin ascended the ranks of the government through extensive bureaucratic manoeuvering and in 1922, received the majority vote to become the General Secretary of the Communist party. In the same year Lenin called for his removal, explaining that Stalin had amassed to much power, in what was to become known as <a href=\"../../terms/l/e.htm#testament\">Lenin's last testament</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nFollowing Lenin's death in 1924, a wave of <a href=\"../../terms/r/e.htm#reaction\">reaction</a> swept through the Soviet government. Stalin introduced his theory of <a href=\"../../terms/s/o.htm#socialism-one-country\">socialism in one country</a>, where he explained that Socialism could be achieved by a single country.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnlike former inner-party debates, where the positions of either side were written in newspapers,  talked about in public meetings and <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#soviets\">soviets</a>; the reaction and practices of the long and devastating civil war, caused a 'debate' that was completely hidden from the public, in order to 'establish the appearance' of a healthy, stable, government.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1927, after years of bureaucratic manoeuvering, the members in the government that were part of the <a href=\"../../orgs/l/e.htm#left-opposition\">Left Opposition</a> were deported on a wide scale. Immediately following, Stalin announced his theory of <a href=\"../../terms/s/o.htm#social-fascism\">social fascism</a>, describing that the theories of Social-Democracy and Fascism were essentially the same. Following this new theory, members of Social-Democratic organisations (of which Bolsheviks were once a part) were arrested or deported. In 1929 the right-wing of the Communist party, led by <a href=\"../../people/b/u.htm#bukharin-nikolai\">Bukharin</a>, was removed from the so-called \"soviet\" government by the Stalinists.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn late 1928, Stalin introduced methods of productively advancing the Soviet Union via forced industrialisation and collectivisation. These efforts were tasked out in five year plans, the first of which included a widescale campaign of mass executions, arrests, and deportations of the <a href=\"../../terms/k/u.htm#kulak\">kulak</a> class. \n</p>\n<p>\nRussia advanced tremendously from the draconian measures implemented to ensure that \"socialism in one country\" could survive. Russia moved from complete devastation and destruction after <a href=\"../../events/w/o.htm#ww1r\">WWI</a> and the Civil War, to become a nation that was one of the most powerful in the world: achieving such goals that 30 years previous would have been viewed as wholly impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n From 1934 to 1939 Stalin ordered a series of executions and imprisonments, largely directed towards people within the Soviet government. Half of the members of the first <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#council-peoples-commissars\">Council of Peoples Commissars</a> were executed in 1938 (A quarter of them had died natural deaths before hand, of the remaining quarter only Stalin lived past 1942). Some government officials executed were thought to be Nazi agents or sympathisers, while others were accused for planning to overthrow the Soviet government. Members of the Left Opposition who were allowed to return to the party after accepting Stalinism were soon executed, those who remained abroad were hunted down and killed. Also executed were people belonging to the right-wing of the party (Bukharin and others). The exact number of people executed is not known, estimates range from thousands to millions. \n</p>\n<p>\nDuring WWII Stalin organised and lead the Soviet Union to victory over the invading Nazi armies.

Taylor grabbed public attention in the 1880s when he reduced the number of workers shovelling coal at the Bethlehem Steel Works from 500 to 140 without loss of production.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Taylor, industrial productivity was lower than it ought to be due to two factors: deliberate malingering by workers and unscientific design of work practices by management. He held that workers could be forced to put the maximum effort into work by a combination of motivating them with higher wages, financed on the basis of higher productivity, and most significantly, by closely monitoring the worker&#8217;s every movement so that it was impossible to go slow without detection. In order to achieve the maximum productivity, Taylor proposed that instead of reducing the number of \"unproductive\" workers to a minimum, about 25% of all employees should be dedicated to supervising, monitoring, measuring and accounting. This was the beginning of the stratification of the working class into more and more layers of supervisory, administrative and technical workers, enjoying privieleges over and above the \"blue-collar\" trades they supervised.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe symbol of Taylor&#8217;s management methods was the stop-watch, ever-present as supervisors conducted \"Time and Motion Studies\", timing every hand-movement, every step, every breath a worker made.

        "content": "\r\nHarriet Taylor, the daughter of Thomas Hardy, a London surgeon, and his wife Harriet Hurst, was born on 8th October, 1807. At the age of eighteen she married John Taylor, a wealthy businessman from Islington. In the next few years Harriet had three children. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJohn and Harriet Taylor both became active in the Unitarian Church and developed radical views on politics. They became friendly with William Fox, a leading Unitarian minister and early supporter of women&#8217;s rights. Harriet Taylor moved in radical circles and in 1830 she met the philosopher John Stuart Mill. Taylor was attracted to Mill, the first man she had met who treated her as an intellectual equal. Mill was impressed with Taylor and asked her to read and comment on the latest book he was working on. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHarriet Taylor&#8217;s relationship with her husband began to deteriorate and in 1833 he agreed to a trial separation. Harriet moved to a house at Walton-on-Thames where John Start Mill visited her at weekends. Although Harriet Taylor and Mill claimed they were not having a sexual relationship, their behaviour scandalized their friends. As a result, the couple became socially isolated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOver the next few years Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill exchanged essays on issues such as marriage and women&#8217;s rights. Those essays that have survived reveal that Taylor held more radical views than Mill on these subjects. Taylor was attracted to the socialist philosophy that had been promoted by Robert Owen in books such as The Formation of Character (1813) and A New View of Society (1814). In her essays Taylor was especially critical of the degrading effect of women&#8217;s economic dependence on men. Taylor thought this situation could only be changed by the radical reform of all marriage laws. Although Mill shared Taylor&#8217;s belief in equal rights, he favoured laws that gave women equality rather than independence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nExcept for a few articles in the Unitarian journal Monthly Repository, Taylor published little of her own work during her lifetime. However, Taylor read and commented on all the material produced by John Stuart Mill. In his autobiography, Mill claimed that Harriet was the joint author of most of the books and articles that were published under his name. He added, &#8220;when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1848 John Stuart Mill&#8217;s Principles of Political Economy was published. Mill planned to include details of the role that Taylor had played in the production of the book, but when John Taylor heard about this he objected and references to his wife were removed. However, in his autobiography, Mill pointed out that Principles of Political Economy was &#8220;a joint production with my wife.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>\r\nJohn Taylor died of cancer on 3rd May, 1849. Still concerned about gossip and scandal, Harriet insisted that they wait two years before they got married. A few months after the wedding the Westminster Review published The Enfranchisement of Women. Although the article had been mainly written by Taylor, it appeared under John Stuart Mill&#8217;s name. The same happened with the publication of an article in the Morning Chronicle (28th August, 1851) where they advocated new laws to protect women from violent husbands. A letter written by Mill in 1854 suggests that Harriet was reluctant to be described as joint author of Mill&#8217;s books and articles. &#8220;I shall never be satisfied unless you allow our best book, the book which is to come, to have our two names on the title page. It ought to be so with everything I publish, for the better half of it all is yours.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJohn Stuart Mill had always favoured the secret ballot but Harriet disagreed and eventually changed her husband&#8217;s views on the subject. Taylor feared that people would vote in their own self-interest rather than for the good of the community. She believed that if people voted in public, the exposure of their selfishness would shame them in voting for the candidate who put forward policies that were in the interests of the majority. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nHarriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill both suffered from tuberculosis. While in France seeking treatment for this condition in November, 1858, Harriet died. Mill and Taylor had been working on a book The Subjection of Women at the time. Helen, Harriet Taylor&#8217;s daughter, now helped Mill to finish the book. The two worked closely together for the next fifteen years. In his autobiography Mill wrote that &#8220;Whoever, either now or hereafter, may think of me and my work I have done, must never forget that it is the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three, the least considerable of whom, and above all the least original, is the one whose name is attached to it.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs well as helping Mill with his books and articles, Helen Taylor was active in the women&#8217;s suffrage campaign. She was an original member of the Kensington Society that produced the first petition requesting votes for women. Helen also accompanied John Stuart Mill to the House of Commons on the day he attempted to add an amendment to the 1867 Reform Act that would have women the same political rights as men. However, the amendment was defeated by 196 votes to 73. Helen Taylor also took part in the agitation for women to be allowed to take part in local government and after the passing of the 1870 Education Act served as a member of the London School Board. </p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/\" target=\"_top\">Spartacus</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"../../t.htm\">Index of the Letter T</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n"

His lectures delivered at the Sun Yat-Sen University in 1927\r\nwere published as a textbook in philosophy (which appeared in English \r\nas Introduction to Dialectical Materialism, New York, 1936), and he \r\nalso worked on the draft programme of the Comintern along with \r\nBukharin. Pressure from the KPD, still uneasy with the leadership of \r\nTh&auml;lmann, secured his return to Germany in 1928, but a year later he \r\nwas expelled from the KPD along with Brandler, and they went on to form\r\nthe KPO, or Brandlerites.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Brandlerite organisation restricted most of its criticisms to the \r\nforeign policy of the Soviet Union, whilst maintaining that its \r\ndomestic operations were basically healthy. Thalheimer insisted that: \r\n&#8216;We do not want to draw the conclusion that as the politics of the \r\nComintern are wrong, it must follow that the politics of Russia are \r\nalso wrong.&#8217; (GdST, 4/1931) Thalheimer himself supported forced \r\ncollectivisation and Stakhanovism, and whilst in Barcelona became \r\ninvolved in a heated argument with Nin over the POUMÕs condemnation of\r\nthe first Moscow Trial.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn exile in Paris from 1932 onwards, Thalheimer went to Spain in 1936,\r\nand then back to France again where the KPO&#8217;s exile organisation \r\nworked.

Later assisted Louis Bonaparte in 1848 to attain the throne, and became a deputy under his government of the Second Empire. Leading up to 1870, Thiers strongly agitated for a war with Prussia, but when France&#8217;s armies suffered defeat after defeat (this all within a period of a few weeks), Thiers quickly changed his policy, and \"spoke out against the war\" when France had already but lost. Through his maneuvering, he placed himself in a victorious political position after France&#8217;s crushing defeat in the war, despite his entire career of agitatation for war. Thiers accomplished this separating himself as far as possible from the Government of National Defense, the government which would be forced to surrender and sign the treaty with Germany.  With the treaty signed, Thiers triumphantly entered the scene and called for national elections: Thiers was elected to 26 different departments; on Feb. 17, 1871 Thiers was elected the \"chief executive power of the republic\", and in August became the first president of the Third Republic. In May, 1871, Thiers sent French soldiers, with the support of the Germans, into Paris to brutally tear apart the <a href=\"../../orgs/p/a.htm#paris-commune\">Paris Commune</a>.

Thomas had an uneventful midwestern childhood, helping to put himself through Marion High School as a paper carrier for Warren G. Harding&#8217;s Marion Daily Star. Like other paper carriers, he reported directly to Florence Kling Harding. &#8220;No pennies ever escaped her,&#8221; said Thomas. The summer after he graduated from high school his father accepted a pastorate at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, which allowed Norman to attend Bucknell University. He left Bucknell after one year to attend Princeton University, the beneficiary of the largesse of a wealthy uncle by marriage. Thomas graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1905.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some settlement work and a trip around the world, Thomas decided to follow in his father&#8217;s footsteps and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary. He graduated from the seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1911. After assisting the Rev. Henry Van Dyke at the fashionable Brick Presbyterian Church on Manhattan&#8217;s Fifth Avenue, Thomas was appointed as pastor for the East Harlem Presbyterian Church, ministering to Italian-American Protestants. Union Theological Seminary had been, at that time, a center of the Social Gospel movement and liberal politics, and as a minister, Thomas preached against American participation in the First World War. This pacifist stance led to his being shunned by many of his fellow alumni from Princeton, and opposed by some of the leadership of the Presbyterian Church in New York. When church funding of the American Parish&#8217;s social programs was stopped, Thomas resigned his pastorate. Despite this resignation of his position, Thomas did not formally leave the ministry until 1931, after his mother&#8217;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Thomas&#8217; position as a conscientious objector which drew him to the Socialist Party of America (SPA), a staunchly antimilitarist organization. When SPA leader <a href=\"../h/i.htm#hillquit-morris\">Morris Hillquit</a> made his campaign for Mayor of New York in 1917 on an anti-war platform, Thomas wrote to him expressing his good wishes. To his surprise, HIllquit wrote back, encouraging the young minister to work for his campaign, which Thomas energetically did. Soon thereafter he himself joined the Socialist Party. Despite his membership in the Marxist SPA, Thomas was never himself an orthodox Marxist, instead favoring a Christian socialist orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas was the secretary of the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation even before the war, then an unpaid position. When the organization started a magazine called The World Tomorrow in January 1918, Thomas was employed as its paid editor. Together with his co-thinker Devere Allen, Thomas helped to make The World Tomorrow the leading voice of liberal Christian social activism of its day. In 1921, Thomas moved to secular journalism, when he was employed as associate editor of The Nation magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1922 Thomas became co-director of the League for Industrial Democracy. Later, he was one of the founders of the National Civil Liberties Bureau (the precursor of the American Civil Liberties Union).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> Electoral politics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas ran for office four times in quick succession on the Socialist ticket&#8212;for Governor of New York in 1924, for Mayor of New York in 1925, for New York State Senate in 1926, and for New York City Alderman in 1927. None of these campaigns were particularly successful. Nevertheless, following <a href=\"../d/e.htm#evd\">Eugene Debs&#8217;</a> death in 1926, there was a leadership vacuum in the Socialist Party. Neither of the party&#8217;s two top political leaders&#8212;Victor L. Berger and Hillquit&#8212;were eligible to run for President of the United States by virtue of their foreign birth. The third main figure, Daniel Hoan was occupied as Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Down to approximately 8,000 dues paying members, the Socialist Party&#8217;s options were limited, and the little known minister from New York with oratorial skills and a pedigree in the movement became the choice of the 1928 National Convention of the Socialist Party as its standard bearer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1928 campaign marked the first of campaigns of Thomas as the Presidential nominee of the Socilaist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas&#8217; influence was considerably greater than that of the typical perennial candidate. Although socialism was viewed as an unsavory form of political thought by most middle-class Americans, the well-educated Thomas&#8212;who often wore three-piece suits&#8212;looked like and talked like a president and gained grudging admiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas frequently spoke on the difference between socialism and Communism, explaining the differences between the movement he represented and that of revolutionary Marxism. His early admiration for the Russian Revolution subsequently turned into devout anti-Communism. (The revolutionaries thought him no better; <a href=\"../t/r.htm#trotsky-leon\">Leon Trotsky</a>, on more than one occasion, levelled high-profile criticism at Thomas, accusing Thomas of  &#8216;...considering himself a socialist by the result of a misunderstanding.&#8217;) He wrote several books, among them his passionate defense of World War I conscientious objectors, Is Conscience a Crime?, and his statement of the 1960s social democratic consensus, Socialism Re-examined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> Socialist Party politics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas failed to isolate himself from the rough and tumble internal factional politics of the Socialist Party, as his predecessor Debs had been able to do. At the 1932 Milwaukee Convention, Thomas and his radical pacifist allies in the party joined forces with constructive socialists from Wisconsin and a faction of young Marxist intellectuals called the &#8220;Militants&#8221; in backing a challenger to National Chairman Morris Hillquit. While Hillquit and his cohort retained control of the organization at this time, this action earned the lasting enmity of Hillquit&#8217;s New York-based allies of the so-called &#8220;Old Guard&#8221;. The diplomatic party peacemaker Hillquit died of tuberculosis the following year, lessening the stability of his faction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the 1934 Convention, Thomas&#8217; connection with the Militants was deepened when he backed a radical Declaration of Principles authored by his long-time associate from the radical pacifist journal The World Tomorrow, Devere Allen. The Militants swept to majority control of the party&#8217;s governing National Executive Committee at this gathering, and the Old Guard retreated to their New York fortress and formalized their factional organization as the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, complete with a shadow Provisional Executive Committee and an office in New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Thomas himself favored work to establish a broad Farmer-Labor Party upon the model of the Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, he nonetheless remained supportive of the Militants and their vision of an &#8220;all-inclusive party,&#8221; which welcomed members of dissident communist organizations (including Lovestoneites and Trotskyists) and worked together with the Communist Party USA in joint Popular Front activities. The party descended into a maelstrom of factionalism in the interval, with the New York Old Guard leaving to establish themselves as the Social Democratic Federation of America, taking with them control of party property, such as the Yiddish-language Jewish Daily Forward, the English-language New York Leader, the Rand School of Social Science, and the party&#8217;s summer camp in Pennsylvania. The party was left in dire financial circumstances. As the social democratic Marxists of the Old Guard were expelled and left the SP in 1936, revolutionary Marxists from the Workers Party of the United States were admitted en masse. Disagreements among the Militant faction led it to shatter into three rival groups, a Right Wing headed by Jack Altman, a Center group called &#8220;Clarity&#8221; headed by Herbert Zam and Gus Tyler, and a Trotskyist revolutionary Left Wing faction called the &#8220;Appeal&#8221; group after the name of their factional newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1937 Thomas returned from Europe determined to restore order in the Socialist Party. He and his followers in the party teamed up with the Clarity majority of the National Executive Committee and gave the green light to the New York Right Wing to expel the Appeal faction from the organization. These expulsions led to the departure of virtually the whole of the party&#8217;s youth section. Demoralization set in and the Socialist Party withered, its membership level below the lowest nadir of 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> Causes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas was initially as outspoken in opposing the Second World War as he was with regard to the First World War. Upon returning from a European tour in 1937, he formed the Keep America Out of War Congress and spoke against war, thereby sharing a platform with the right wing isolationist America First Committee. However, after the United States was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, his stance changed to support for US involvement , and later wrote self-critically for having &#8220;overemphasized both the sense in which it was a continuance of World War I and the capacity of nonfascist Europe to resist the Nazis.&#8221;.\r\nNorman Thomas, 1962</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas was one of the few public figures to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Thomas accused the ACLU of &#8220;dereliction of duty&#8221; when the organization supported the internment. Thomas also campaigned against racial segregation, environmental depletion, anti-labor laws and practices, and in favor of opening the United States to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas was an early proponent of birth control. The eugenicist Margaret Sanger recruited him to write &#8220;Some Objections to Birth Control Considered&#8221; in Religious and Ethical Aspects of Birth Control, edited and published by Sanger in 1926. Thomas accused the Roman Catholic Church of hypocritical opinions on sex, such as requiring priests to be celibate and maintaining that lay people should only have sex to reproduce. &#8220;This doctrine of unrestricted procreation is strangely inconsistent on the lips of men who practice celibacy and preach continence.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas also deplored the secular objection to birth control because it originated from &#8220;racial and national&#8221; group-think. &#8220;The white race, we are told, our own nation&#8212;whatever that nation may be&#8212;is endangered by practicing birth control. Birth control is something like disarmament&#8212;a good thing if effected by international agreement, but otherwise dangerous to us in both a military and economic sense. If we are not to be overwhelmed by the &#8217;rising tide of color&#8217; we must breed against the world. If our nation is to survive, it must have more cannon and more babies as prospective food for the cannon.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> Later years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1945 Thomas sought to make the non-Communist left the vanguard of social reform, in collaboration with labor leaders like Walter Reuther. He championed many seemingly unrelated progressive causes, while leaving unstated the essence of his political and economic philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1961, Thomas released an album The Minority Party in America: Featuring an Interview with Norman Thomas, on Folkways Records, which focused on the role of the third party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas&#8217; 80th birthday in 1964 was marked by a well-publicized gala at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan. At the event Thomas called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and read birthday telegrams from Hubert Humphrey, Earl Warren, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He also received a check for $17,500 in donations from supporters. &#8220;It won&#8217;t last long,&#8221; he said of the check, &#8220;because every organization I&#8217;m connected with is going bankrupt.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas died on December 19, 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan and the Norman Thomas &#8217;05 Library at Princeton University&#8217;s Forbes college are named after him. He was also the grandfather of Newsweek columnist Evan Thomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plaque in the Norman Thomas &#8217;05 Library reads: Norman M. Thomas, class of 1905. &#8220;I am not the champion of lost causes, but the champion of causes not yet won.&#8221;</p>\r\n\r\n"

The <em>New Reasoner</em> amalgamated with another &#8216;socialist humanist&#8217; journal to form the <em>New Left Review</em>. However, Thompson increasing came into conflict with the editors of the <em>New Left Review</em> in opposition to rationalist and anti-humanist interpretations of Marxism, culminating in 1978 with his onslaught on &#8216;Stalinism in theory&#8217; of <em>The Poverty of Theory</em> &#8212; calling on Marxist intellectuals return to the program of the (old) New Left outlined in the <em>Epistle to the Philistines</em> of 1957.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, the main target of Thompson&#8217;s polemic had shifted, and the sixties were spent inveighing not so much against Stalinism, but the philistinism of &#8216;Natopolitanism&#8217; and the apathy of the Labour Left and CP dissenters in leaving capitalism to &#8216;rot on the bough&#8217; when Britain was over-ripe for socialism.

Both Will Thorne and his wife were illiterate and were unable to sign their names on the marriage certificate. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1882 Will and Harriet and their two children moved to London. Thorne found work at the Beckton Gasworks. Soon after arriving in the capital Thorne joined the Canning Town branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Thorne was appointed secretary of the branch and began attending national meetings of the organisation where he met H. M. Hyndman, George Bernard Shaw, Tom Mann, John Burns, Edward Aveling and Friedrich Engels. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the SDF, Eleanor Marx, helped to teach Thorne how to read and write. Thorne&#8217;s confidence in his abilities gradually grew and by the late 1880s he was one of the SDF&#8217;s best known public speakers. At this time Thorne considered himself a communist and named one of his sons after Karl Marx.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1889 Thorne helped to establish the National Union of Gasworkers &amp; General Labourers. He then defeated Ben Tillett in the election for the post of General Secretary of the union. Thorne led the successful negotiations for an eight hour day in the industry. As they previously did twelve hour shifts this was a great advert for union power and the Gasworkers&#8217; Union soon had over 20,000 members. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWill Thorne&#8217;s success also inspired other unions to demand better pay and conditions. The most important of these was the London Dock Strike led by Ben Tillett in 1889. The dockers demanded four hours continuous work at a time and a minimum rate of sixpence an hour. The employers hoped to starve the dockers back to work but Thorne and other trade union activists such as John Burns, Eleanor Marx, James Keir Hardie and H. H. Champion, gave valuable support to the 10,000 men out on strike. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Labour Church raised money for the strikers and their families. Trade Unions in Australia sent over £30,000 to help the dockers to continue the struggle. After five weeks the employers accepted defeat and granted all the dockers&#8217; main demands. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThorne was now seen as a dangerous man and attempts were made to weaken the Gasworkers&#8217; Union. South Metropolitan Gas Company introduced a profit sharing scheme for the workforce and during the strike in 1890 the Leeds Gas Company sacked union members. When the Gasworkers&#8217; Union forced the company to reinstate the workers, Friedrich Engels was so impressed with Thorne&#8217;s leadership he gave him an autographed copy of <em>Das Kapital</em>. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1894 Thorne was elected to the Trades Union Congress Parliamentary Committee (a position he held until 1933). Thorne was also active in local politics and in West Ham served as a Town Councillor (1891-1910), Alderman (1910-46) and Mayor (1917-18). </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThorne helped Keir Hardie win the West Ham seat in the 1892 General Election. After Hardie was defeated in 1895 and moved to Merthyr Tydfil, Thorne became the Labour Party candidate in West Ham. Defeated in the 1900 General Election he finally won the right to represent West Ham in the House of Commons in the 1906 General Election. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnlike many of his former colleagues in the Social Democratic Federation, Thorne supported Britain&#8217;s involvement in the First World War. He joined the West Ham Volunteer Force with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. His eldest son also joined the army and was killed at Ypres in 1917.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThorne was one of the MPs chosen to visit Russia during the revolution of 1917. When he returned he had meetings with both the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, and King George V.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the 1918 General Election Thorne won the Plaistow seat for the Labour Party. He held this new seat until his retirement before the 1945 General Election. Will Thorne died on 2nd January, 1946. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../t.htm\">Index of the Letter T</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

        "content": "\nThe son of a labourer, Ben Tillett was born in Bristol in 1860. His mother died when he was a child and a succession of step-mothers treated him very badly. He ran away from home as a child and found work as an acrobat in a circus. He also worked as a shoemaker but at the age of thirteen he joined the Navy. In 1876 he was wounded and invalided out of the service. </p>\n<p>\nTillet moved to London after after marrying Jane Tompkins he settled down in Bethnal Green. He found a job as a shoemaker but after he was made redundant he found work in the London Docks. He eventually became a teacooper at the Monument Tea Warehouse. </p>\n<p>\nIt was while living in London that Tillett became a Christian Socialist. He attended the local Congregational Church and joined the Temperance Society. Tillet attended evening classes and despite a speech impediment, developed an ambition to become a barrister. Tillet joined the Tea Operatives &amp; General Labourers' Association. Tillett was very vocal at meetings and in 1887 he was elected to the post of General Secretary.</p>\n<p>\nThe following year Tillett led a strike at Tilbury Dock. The workers were defeated and Tillett became so depressed that he considered leaving the union. He campaigned for the post as General Secretary of the Gasworkers' Union but he was defeated by Will Thorne. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1889 Tillet's union members became involved in the London Dock Strike. The dockers demanded four hours continuous work at a time and a minimum rate of sixpence an hour. Tillet soon emerged with Tom Mann and John Burns as one of the three main leaders of the strike. During the strike Tillett lost his speech impediment and was acknowledged as one of the labour movement's greatest orators. </p>\n<p>\nThe employers hoped to starve the dockers back to work but other trade union activists such as Will Thorne, Eleanor Marx, James Keir Hardie and H. H. Champion, gave valuable support to the 10,000 men now out on strike. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and the Labour Church raised money for the strikers and their families. Trade Unions in Australia sent over £30,000 to help the dockers to continue the struggle. After five weeks the employers accepted defeat and granted all the dockers' main demands. </p>\n<p>\nAfter the successful strike, the dockers formed a new General Labourers' Union. Tillett was elected General Secretary and Tom Mann became the union's first President. In London alone, 20,000 men joined this new union. Tillett and Mann wrote a pamphlet together called the New Unionism, where they outlined their socialist views and explained how their ideal was a \"cooperative commonwealth\". </p>\n<p>\nTillett was now one of England's leading socialists. He was a member of the Fabian Society and was one of the founders of the Independent Labour Party. In the 1892 General Election he was the the ILP's candidate in Bradford and only lost to the Liberal Party candidate by 500 votes.</p>\n<p>\nTillet was one of the founders of the Labour Party but did not get on with its two main leaders, James Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald. In 1908 he attacked the leadership in his pamphlet Is the Parliamentary Labour Party a Failure? and soon afterwards left to join the Social Democratic Party. </p>\n<p>\nIn September 1910 Tillett helped to establish the National Transport Workers' Federation, an organisation of 250,000 workers. He became the leader of the union and in 1911 it won a national strike. However, the following year, Tillett's union suffered a defeat at the hands of the Port of London Authority. It was during this strike that Tillet joined with George Lansbury and Will Dyson to form the trade union newspaper, the <em>Daily Herald</em>. </p>\n<p>\nUnlike many socialist, Ben Tillett fully supported Britain's involvement in the First World War. His enthusiasm for aerial bombardment of German civilian centres and his views that pacifists should be severely punished, made him unpopular with many people in the labour movement. Tillett travelled throughout Britain and helped to recruit a large number of industrial workers into the armed forces.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1917 Ben Tillett stood as an Independent candidate in a by-election at North Salford. During the campaign he attacked the Labour Party for its internationalist views. With the strong anti-German feeling at the time, Tillett had little difficulty winning the seat. </p>\n<p>\nIn the 1918 General Election Tillett stood as the Labour Party candidate in North Salford. However, his views were now very conservative and was unable to obtain a senior position in the parliamentary party. Tillett wanted to become General Secretary of the new Transport and General Workers Union but he had little support and he decided not to stand for the post. </p>\n<p>\nTillett retired from the House of Commons in 1931. Except for an attempt to organize a boxer's union in 1932, he ceased to be active in the labour movement. Ben Tillett died on 27th January, 1943.</p>\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "\nBorn in Croatia on May 25, 1892 of a native peasant and a Slovene mother. </p>\n<p>Kumrovec lies in the Croatian Zagorje and Croatia was still under Austro-Hungarian rule. Broz worked as a mechanic in small workshops. During World War I, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army. He was captured as a prisoner of war and transported to the Russian interior. He joined a Bolshevik group while in prison and after escaping, he joined the Bolshevik Red Guards several months before the October Revolution.\n</p>\n<p>He was registered as a member of the Communist party. Back in Yugoslavia, he continued his revolutionary work as a secretary of a metal union. He was picked up and spent six years in prison. He was released in 1934 and joined the Comintern in Moscow. Visited Moscow several times and was appointed Secretary of Yugoslav Communist Party in 1937. His success was due in part to the internal rivalry of communist leaders. In January 1939, he was officially appointed general secretary of the Yugoslav Communist Party. </p>\n<p>After Nazi invasion, set up his Partisans in Southern Serbia in 1941, and led by far the most powerful resistance movement in Europe. By end of the War, Tito&#8217;s forces had control of the whole country. Refused to take Stalin&#8217;s direction, and was expelled from the Cominform in 1948. Remained leader of the country till his death in 1980. </p>\n<p>From then on, Tito had a major voice in all the ensuing phases of the Yugoslav revolution. During World War II, he became commander in chief of the partisan armed forces. In 1943, the Second Session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia established the second Yugoslavia as a federal socialist republic of  six republics. Tito had to make use of all his charisma to convince his comrade-partisans that all peoples of Yugoslavia should be granted equal rights. The partisan struggle ended with a complete victory of the communists. Supported strategically by their allies, both of the West and the East, complying formally with some demands for  a multi-party system, Tito could form his first government on March 7, 1945. The politicians of the former Kingdom and some well intentioned participants of the liberation war were completely neutralized and soon eliminated by the power policy of the Communist Party. </p>\n<p>More dangerous for Tito&#8217;s political career was the clash with the USSR. The Cominform conflict led to a break with Moscow. Tito&#8217;s internal power base was threatened as well, and large-scale purges in the party were bitterly needed. Needed also was an alternative ideology. In the beginning of the 1950s self-management was rediscovered in Marx&#8217;s writings and step by step introduced in Yugoslavia. But this timid democratization of the regime again threatened the party organization, now from within. In 1952, Tito was forced to put aside his close aid and once vice-president of Yugoslavia, Milovan &#272;ilas. Another possible heir, Aleksander Rankovic, dominated the Ministry of the Interior and the secret police for years. He ultimately controlled Tito himself and tapped his telephone. In 1966, Tito was obliged to discard his conservative comrade, the second in rank. </p>\n<p>After the fall of hardliner Rankovi&#263;, economic and political liberalization broke through and this threatened the party monopoly anew. The Croatian Spring and similar opposition movements in other republics rose to an unexpected intensity. They were ultimately repressed by Tito in the 1970s after the Kara&#273;or&#273;evo crisis meeting. At the same time, on advice of the Slovene Edvard Kardelj, he pushed through constitutional reforms to take the wind out of the sails of nationalism. By granting more autonomy, responsibility and formal self-government to the republics, he hoped to reduce the tensions between the federal units. In the same spirit, he set up a federal presidency structure to ensure the continuity of the system after his death.</p>\n<p>In international affairs, Tito profited much from the rivalries of the two blocs during the Cold War. He played a leading role in the movement of the so-called Non-Aligned Countries. </p>\n<p>Tito died in May 1980 and the structures set up to ensure continuity functioned more or less satisfactorily for a few years. Then, divergent aspirations could no longer be reconciled and the federal structure exploded. External Western interest had been eroded away by the fall of the communist system in the USSR. </p>\n<p>There exist a lot of myths about Tito, beginning with his date of birth, following the different names he carried and ending with the suggestion that part of his official life was not his, but figured by a (German or Austrian) double. Probably, all these histories were not very significant for the course of the Yugoslav history. Anyhow, new stories will present themselves and all of Tito&#8217;s biographies should be read with care and suspicion.</p>\n<p>One good of the many bibliographies of Tito is: Phyllis, Auty. <em>Political leaders of the Twentieth century</em>.

Tresca moved to the United States in 1904, to escape a prison term for his radical political activities in Italy. He settled in Philadelphia, where he became the editor of Il Proletario, the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation (ISF). Tresca helped shift the political orientation of the ISF to Syndicalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tresca and anarchism</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tresca&#8217;s political views became increasingly more radical and he soon came to identify himself as an anarchist. Tresca resigned as editor of Il Proletario and began publishing his own newspaper, La Plebe. He would later transfer La Plebe to Pittsburgh and, with it, revolutionary ideas to Italian miners and mill workers in Western Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tresca joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1912, when he was invited by the union to Lawrence, Massachusetts to help mobilize the Italian workers during a campaign to free strike leaders Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, who were in prison on false murder charges. After the victorious strike in Lawrence, Tresca was active in several strikes across the United States; the Little Falls, New York textile workers&#8217; strike (1912), the New York City hotel workers&#8217; strike (1913), the Paterson silk strike (1913), and the Mesabi Range, Minnesota, miners&#8217; strike (1916).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Opposition to fascism, Stalinism, and the Mafia</strong>\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tresca became a major figure among Italian-Americans in trying to halt Benito Mussolini&#8217;s attempts to organize Italian immigrants into Fascist support groups. At this time, Tresca was editing an anti-Fascist newspaper named Il Martello, where he blasted Mussolini as a class enemy and traitor (the latter accusation made reference to the socialist roots of Fascism). Tresca&#8217;s activities were being monitored in Rome, while, in the United States, he was under heavy surveillance from the American government. In 1926, Fascists attempted to assassinate Tresca with a bomb during a rally. He was part of the defense committee for accused murderers Sacco and Vanzetti, and frequently spoke in their defense at rallies and in articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet Communists and Stalinism, particularly after the Soviet Union had engineered the destruction of the anarchist movement in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution.[1] Prior to this, Tresca had supported the Bolsheviks, reasoning that a Communist state was preferable to a capitalist state, regarding Soviet Communists as allies in the fight against Fascism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tresca was a member of the Dewey Commission which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 1938 Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Juliet Poyntz to prevent her defection from the Communist Party USA underground apparatus. Tresca alleged that, before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about her disgust over Joseph Stalin&#8217;s Great Terror. In 1941 Tresca, in a revealing moment, admitted to Max Eastman that Nicola Sacco was guilty of the crime with which he was charged, though Vanzetti was innocent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In New York, Tresca also began a public campaign of criticism of the Mafia in his weekly newspaper, Il Martello. Tresca appeared to be well aware of the risk he was running to his life. At the end of an article published shortly before his death, Tresca stated, &#8220;Morris Ernst, my attorney, knows all the facts. He knows that if an anti-fascist is assaulted or killed, the instigator is Generose Pope&#8221; (this is believed to be a reference to Generoso Pope Sr., a New York political power broker with ties to mobster Frank Costello, whose Italian-American newspaper interests included the Corriere d&#8217;America and the daily Il Progresso Italo-Americano).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Assassination</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1943 Tresca, on parole at the time, was under police surveillance. On January 9, 1943, his surveillance team witnessed an incident in which a speeding car attempted to run Tresca over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, Tresca was leaving his parole officer&#8217;s offices when he dodged surveilling officers by jumping into a car that was waiting for him. Two hours later, Tresca was crossing Fifth Avenue on foot when a black Ford pulled up beside him. A short, squat gunman in a brown coat jumped out and shot Tresca in the back and head with a handgun, killing him instantly. The black Ford was later found abandoned nearby with all four doors open. It was widely believed at the time that Mafia enforcer Carmine Galante was the suspected assassin, acting on orders from Vito Genovese, who was at the time intent on gaining Mussolini&#8217;s favor by eliminating a long-time enemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others have theorized that Tresca was eliminated by the NKVD as retribution for criticism of the Stalin regime of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">Gleaned from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Tresca</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Born into a noble family, Tukhachevsky graduated from the Alekzanderskoe Military Academy in 1914.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTukhachevsky fought in the Russian Army during the First World War. After the October Revolution he joined the Bolsheviks. Tukhachevsky became an officer in the Red Army and was given responsibility of defending Moscow in 1918.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLeon Trotsky gave Tukhachevsky command of the 5th Army in 1920 and he managed to capture Siberia from Alexander Kolchak. He also helped defeat General Anton Denikin in the Crimea in 1920. Tukhachevsky fought in Poland and helped suppress the Kronstadt Rising in 1921.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTukhachevsky served as chief of staff (1925-28) and as deputy commissar for defence. He wrote several books on modern warfare and in 1931 was given a leading role in reforming the Red Army. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1935 Tukhachevsky was made a marshal of the Soviet Union. However, Joseph Stalin became convinced that the leaders of the Red Army were involved in a plot to overthrow him. In June, 1937, Tukhachevsky and seven other top commanders were arrested and charged with conspiracy with Germany. Mikhail Tukhachevsky was found guilty and executed on 11th June, 1937. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1936 Heydrich, chief of Intelligence in Germany, received a visit from a former officer in the Czarist army, General Skoblin. This general without an army was consoling himself for his inactivity by playing double agent on a grand scale. For many years he had been working for Soviet Intelligence on the side.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe news he brought Heydrich was momentous: he had it on good authority that Marshal Tukhachevsky was plotting an armed insurrection against Stalin. Heydrich passed this on to the Nazi high command, who discussed what course to follow. There were only two options: allow the head of the Soviet Army to go ahead with the plan, or warn Stalin and, as a bonus, give him proof of the marshal's collusion with the Wehrmacht. The second solution was chosen.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe most sophisticated apparatus for conveying top-secret orders was at the service of Nazi propaganda and terror. Heydrich had made a study of the Russian OGPU, the Soviet secret security service. He then engineered the Red Army purges carried out by Stalin. The Russian dictator believed his own armed forces were infiltrated by German agents as a consequence of a secret treaty by which the two countries helped each other rearm. Secrecy bred suspicion, which bred more secrecy, until the Soviet Union was so paranoid it became vulnerable to every hint of conspiracy. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nLate in 1936, Heydrich had thirty-two documents forged to play on Stalin's sick suspicions and make him decapitate his own armed forces. The Nazi forgeries were incredibly successful. More than half the Russian officer corps, some 35,000 experienced men, were executed or banished.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Soviet chief of Staff, Marshal Tukhachevsky, was depicted as having been in regular correspondence with German military commanders. All the letters were Nazi forgeries. But Stalin took them as proof that even Tukhachevsky was spying for Germany. It was a most devastating and clever end to the Russo-German military agreement, and it left the Soviet Union in absolutely no condition to fight a major war with Hitler.</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/tukachevsky/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Mikhail Tukachevsky Archive</a></p> \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Turing was the first advocate of Artificial Intelligence, arguing that there was nothing human which could not be emulated by a computer, and that consequently computers would eventually &#8216;be able to think&#8217;; his arguments are closely connected to Behaviourism and are at the root of contemporary Complexity Theories of society. <a href=\"../c/h.htm#chomsky-noam\">Chomsky</a>&#8217;s linguistics also have their origins in Turing&#8217;s conception of computer language.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBorn in India and educated at Cambridge, Turing took his PhD at Princeton before taking up a fellowship at King's College. During World War II he worked with the British Government Code and Cypher School, where he developed brilliant techniques to break the enemy's codes. In 1945 he joined the National Physical Laboratory in London to build a large electronic digital computer. In 1948 he became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at the University of Manchester, building the computer with the largest memory capacity in the world at that time. His pioneering work on the theory of computer languages was of epoch-making significance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was his early work at Princeton however, which has had the most profound affect on the development of philosophy. In 1935, he took on the task of finding an algorithm (i.e. a finite sequence of well-defined steps of reasoning) to find undecidable propositions in a mathematical theory which <a href=\"../g/o.htm#godel-kurt\">G&ouml;del</a> had proved, in his 1931 theorem, must exist in every theory; the aim being to eliminate them and restore the theory to completeness and consistency, effectively negating G&ouml;del's theorem.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe surprising result was &#8220;<span class=\"book\">On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Halting Problem</span>&#8221; in which Turing described a hypothetical (&#8220;Turing&#8221;) machine with (1) a finite set of instructions (program), (2) some means of executing the instructions step-by-step (processor), and (3) some readable means for recording each step (memory). This elementary Turing machine was able to execute <em>any</em> algorithm and became the theoretical model for the digital computers that would come into being in the 1940s. The problem Turing had set out to solve was now transformed into the problem of whether or not there was a program, which once initiated, would keep the computer working without ever stopping or getting into a repetitive cycle. The fact that this approach failed to negate G&ouml;del's theorem, verified it in fact, paled next to the significance of the &#8220;Turing machine&#8221;, but finally put to rest the hopes of <a href=\"../../people/h/i.htm#hilbert-david\">David Hilbert</a> and his school that all mathematical propositions could be expressed as a set of axioms and derived theorems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTuring is also renowned as the first champion of Artificial Intelligence, claiming that computers would eventually be constructed that would be capable of human thought, and he proposed a simple test, now known as the Turing test, to assess this capability.

He studied geology and paleontology at the University of Berlin before coming to America and joining the merchant marine, spending 10 years on board ships plying the South Seas trade routes. Back in America, he became a US citizen in 1893. Untermann was a member of the Socialist Labor Party in the 1890s and was a regular contributor to Algie Simons&#8217; <em>Workers Call,</em> published in Chicago, as well as its successor, <em>The Chicago Socialist.</em> When Simons moved to Chicago to assume the editorship of <em>International Socialist Review,</em> published by the pioneer American Marxist publishing house, Charles H. Kerr  &amp;  Co., Untermann&#8217;s work followed, and he was a frequent contribtor to that publication.</p>\n<p>Untermann was the first American translator of Karl Marx&#8217;s <em>Das Kapital,</em> beginning work on the massive project in the spring of 1905 while living on a chicken farm in Orlando, Florida and completing translations of volumes 2 and 3 for Kerr in 1907 and 1909, respectively.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n1\">[1]</a></sup> He also translated other socialist works for an American audience, including the memoirs of Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel as well as <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State,</em> by Frederick Engels. In addition to translations from German and Italian, Untermann wrote original works on Economics and Natural History. Untermann&#8217;s books included <em>Science and Revolution</em> (1905), <em>The World&#8217;s Revolutions</em> (1906), <em>Marxian Economics: A Popular Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx&#8217;s Capital</em> (1907).</p>\n<p>Untermann professed an adherence to the thinking of Karl Kautsky and Joseph Dietzgen. He held that science had a class basis and drew very radical conclusions from this premise without hesitation or pulling of punches, writing in his 1905 book, <em>Science and Revolution,</em> that</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;I speak as a proletarian and a socialist. I make no pretense to be a scientist without class affiliation. There has never been any science which was not made possible, and which was not influenced, by the economic and class environment of the various scientists. I am, indeed, aware of the fact that there are certain general facts in all sciences which apply to all mankind regardless of classes. But I am also aware of the other fact, that the concrete application of any general scientific truth to different historical conditions and men varies considerably, because abstract truths have a general applicability only under abstract conditions, but are more or less modified in the contact with concrete environments.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Untermann further indicated that &#8220;bourgeois science&#8221; was perpetually under assault in capitalist society and that &#8220;university professors have learned to their bitter disappointment that freedom of science is little respected when it runs counter to freedom of trade.&#8221; Hence:</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Under these circumstances, the proletariat cannot place any reliance on bourgeois science. it must and will maintain a critical attitude toward all bourgeois science, and accept nothing that does not stand the test of proletarian standards.</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;So far as bourgeois science coincides with the findings of proletarian science, we shall gladly accept and foster every truth... But we shall on our part reject everything which tends to strengthen the ruling class, endanger the progress of the proletarian revolution, or interfere with the advance of human knowledge and control of natural forces in general.&#8221;<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Rather unsurprisingly, his <em>Science and Revolution</em> was translated into Russian and published in Soviet Ukraine in 1923.</p>\n<p>Untermann was on the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of America from 1908-10 and was the Socialist candidate for Governor of Idaho in 1910 and for US Senate from California in 1912. He believed strongly in support of the affiliated unions of the AF of L and opposed to the more radical approach of the Industrial Workers of the World.</p>\n<p>Untermann was a delegate to the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, serving on the Committee on Immigration. He was a chief author, along with Joshua Wanhope, of a resolution on immigration which was pro-exclusionary - called &#8220;racist&#8221; by its critics - backing the AF of L in its desire to stop manufacturers from importing cheap, non-union labor from the Far East. Untermann and Wanhope were joined as a majority on this point by journalist Robert Hunter and J. Stitt Wilson of California.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n4\">[4]</a></sup> John Spargo, Meyer London, and Leo Laukki were the minority on this committee, opposing exclusionism. Untermann and Wanhope&#8217;s majority proposal was effectively killed by the convention on motion by Charles Solomon of New York not to receive the committee&#8217;s report, but rather to hold the matter open for further investigation and final decision by the next party convention, scheduled for four years hence.<sup class=\"enote\"><a href=\"#n5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Untermann later served as Foreign Editor of Victor Berger&#8217;s socialist daily, the <em>Milwaukee Leader,</em> beginning in 1921.</p>\n<p>Untermann was also a painter of great accomplishment, specializing in landscapes and prehistoric flora and fauna. He was known as &#8216;The Artist of the Uintas&#8217;. He contributed paintings, murals, and panels to the Dinosaur National Monument, the old Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum and has a large collection of paintings at the new Utah Field House of Natural History State Park museum in Vernal, Utah.

Released on appeal after serving 30 months, he was arrested along with hundreds of other militants in 1970 , when  the Trudeau government imposed war measures after the kidnappings by the FLQ of Quebec&#8217;s Labor Minister Pierre Laporte, and British commercial attaché James Richard Cross. </p>\n<p>Laporte&#8217;s execution at the hands of the FLQ cost it what public support it had, and Vallières himself soon publicly renounced the movement and joined the Parti Québécois (PQ).

Among his clients was Djamila Bouhired, who was tried for her role in the planting of the bomb at the Milk Bar in Algiers during the Battle of Algiers.

After an ill-fated love affair, a break with his family and a\ndeep intellectual crisis, Verri arrived on the scene in 1757 with his sharp\nsatirical annual, <i>Il gran Zoroastro</i>. After a brief stint in the\nAustrian army in 1759-60, Verri returned to Milan, where he quickly fell in\namong the Italian Enlightenment figures of the day, notably Cesare Beccaria.</p>\n<p>\nWith Beccaria and his own brother, Alessandro Verri, he founded the &quot;Società\ndei Pugni&quot; in 1761, a discussion group concentrating on public policy and\neconomics. From 1764 to 1766, the group published the Enlightenment\njournal, <i>Il Caffè</i>.</p>\n<p>\nVerri began publishing tracts on economic questions in 1760.&nbsp;&nbsp; In\n1763, he produced his <i>Meditazioni sulla felicità</i>, a treatise on\nhedonistic ethics along the lines of Helvétius (spiced with Rousseau), thus making him one of the\nfathers of utilitarianism. It was Verri who pushed Beccaria into making his seminal\ncontributions to utilitarian social philosophy.</p>\n<p>\nAfter <i>Il Caffè </i>was closed down and the group dispersed, Verri took up\na variety of posts in the Austrian administration.&nbsp; He used this time to\npublish some of his most famous utilitarian\ntracts: his 1773 <i>Discorso</i> and his 1777 treatise denouncing the use of\ntorture.</p>\n<p>\nVerri's 1771 <i>Meditzioni sull' economia politica</i> was perhaps his\ngreatest contribution to economic theory. Verri argued that price depends on the &quot;apparent abundance&quot; of a good and the\n&quot;need&quot; for it. He defines &quot;need&quot; as a species of\npain which humans seek to minimize activity and industry. For Verri, &quot;needs&quot;\nare not mere desires but must be expressed with payment, thus they can be\nconsidered &quot;demands&quot; in the modern sense. Following Beccaria,\nVerri noted that abundance increases with number of offers (i.e. sellers) and\n &quot;needs&quot; with the number of sellers. He notes that\nthe value of a commodity varies directly with need and inversely to\nabundance. In this manner, Verri can be regarded as an important predecessor of the Marginalist Revolution.</p>\n<p>\nVerri's quantitative work includes not only admirable attempt at\ncalculating the balance of payments, but also the first mathematical expression of a\ndemand curve. On economic policy, Verri followed the radical <i>laissez-faire</i>\npositions advocated by the Physiocrats. Interestingly, he disagreed with Hume's\n&quot;reflux&quot; principle, arguing that balance of payments adjustment occur\nnot through prices but rather through the levels of aggregate economic activity\n(thus making him an early Keynesian).</p>\n<p>\nIn his official capacities in the Austrian administration, Verri tried to\npush many economic and administrative reforms through, with little\nsuccess.&nbsp; In 1772, Verri was vice-president, and then, in 1780, president, of the Chamber of\nCounts.&nbsp; He retired from public life in 1786 and lived on long enough to\nwelcome the French Revolution.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/\">History of Economic Thought</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../v.htm\">Index of the Letter V</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n"

The USSR had supported the establishment of the Jewish state and, for Vilner, it was also a matter of freeing a British colony. As he later said, the document, because it was written in conformity with UN Resolutions, &#8220;calls for the creation of an independent Arab state. So it means a Jewish state and an Arab state. That is what we signed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was a member of the Knesset from 1949 &#8212; 1990, and while there was a tireless advocate for Palestinian rights. His report on the Israeli army&#8217;s massacre at Kufr-Qassem resulted in 11 convictions for murder. From his seat in the Knesset he also condemned Israel for attacking Egypt, Syria and Jordan in June 1967, a stand that earned him a knife attack by a member of the right-wing Herut movement.</p>\n<p>In the mid-1960&#8217;s the Israeli Communist Party split along essentially ethnic lines, with the Moshe Sneh &#8212;  Shmuel Mikunis group, which was accused of Jewish nationalism, taking most of the Jewish members, and the Vilner &#8212; Tawfiq Toubi group taking most of the Arab members. The Sneh group was given the right to use the Communist Party name, while the Vilner group took the name New Communist List (Rakach). Rakach remained staunchly pro-Soviet, and the CPI became a left-wing adjunct of the socialist Zionists, until it eventually dissolved. </p>\n<p>Vilner was Secretary General from 1965 &#8212; 1990, but in his last years was marginalized within the party, when the journal he edited was closed down and he was excluded from the Central Committee.</p>\n<p>When he died he was the last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. </p>\n<p>Summing up his political life, and his party&#8217;s role in Israeli society, he said: &#8220;I have always stressed that we are defending the rights not only of the Palestinian people but of the Israeli people.

There is dispute over the authorship of Voloshinov&#8217;s work, some of which is attributed to Bakhtin.</p>\n<p>For Voloshinov, language is the medium of ideology. Language is a socially constructed sign-system, a material reality which is the necessary preconditions for consciousness. Voloshinov criticised Saussure&#8217;s unhistorical structuralism, claiming that words are dynamic social signs, which take different meanings for different social classes in different historical contexts. Meaning therefore includes the active participation of both the speaker (or writer) and hearer (or reader). While every word is a sign taken from among available signs, the manipulation of the word contained in each individual utterance is regulated by social relations. Voloshinov claims that there is a continuous class struggle over the meaning of words. Because the &#8216;struggle for meaning&#8217; coincides with class struggle, Voloshinov can be seen as anticipating Gramsci&#8217;s conception of ideology and language.</p>\n<p>The Bakhtin Circle addressed the social and cultural issues posed by the Russian Revolution and its degeneration under Stalin in philosophical terms.

But things turned out differently. He joined the Physics Department of Moscow State University, studied there three years, but when it came to the practical exercises in the lab, realized that physics was not his vocation. Subsequently, he used to joke that he had two left hands. Officially, he interrupted his studies due to illness, but did not return to the Physics Faculty and in 1950 joined the department of political economy at MGEI (Moscow State Economics Institute).</p>\n<p>His scientific and political proclivities were displayed as a student. He was an active member of the FNL faculty, student member of the editorial board of a scientific journal and a union and Komsomol organizer. His first work was published in the scientific notes for students at MGEI in 1955. Vygodsky graduated with honors from the institute and successfully passed the competitive examination to become a postgraduate external student at the Economics Institute. Simultaneously, on the recommendation of Professor PK Figurnova he was employed at the Institute of Marx &#8211; Engels &#8211; Lenin &#8211; Stalin (from 1956 &#8211; the Institute of Marxism-Leninism). It is here that Vygodsky worked for more than 35 years, having gone through all steps of career &#8211; from junior to senior researcher to head of the group working on theoretical problems of Marxism.</p>\n<p>Starting work, Vitaly immediately showed himself as a talented Marxologist. His subsequent direction of research included the genesis of the economic teachings of Marx and the history of the creation of <i>Capital</i>. The results of this was his Ph.D. and first monograph &#8220;The place of Theories of Surplus Value in the economic legacy of Karl Marx&#8221; (1961). </p>\n<p>A particularly important part of their work, to which he gave considerable energy, was his involvement in the international group of MEGA &#8211; the complete edition of works by Marx and Engels in their original language. Vitaly was a great promoter of economic theory. His books, such as &#8220;The History of a Great Beginning of Karl Marx,&#8221; &#8220;On the History of the Creation of <i>Capital</i>,&#8221; and many others have been translated and published in Italy, Germany, China, Mexico, Japan and many other countries. The full bibliography of works by Vygodsky includes 186 titles. </p>\n<p>In 1974 he became a Doctor of Economic Sciences. He was awarded the title of Honored Worker of Science. He died on 8 May 1998. </p>\n<p>Vygodsky is of particular significance to English-speaking students of Marx as Editor of Volume 31 and Scientific Editor of Volumes 30, 32 and 34 of the English edition of Marx &#8211; Engels Collected Works. He may also have been the anonymous author of the Introduction to the three volume English translation of Theories of Surplus-Value, which shows signs of his influence. </p>\n<p class=\"inline\">(Based on a memorandum prepared for the Rossiyiskaya Ekonomicheskaya Akadmiya by Svetlana Masunina using materials from Ludmila Vasina, staff member of Institute of Marxism-Leninism).</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/vygodsky/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Vitaly Vygodsky Archive</a></p> \n\n\n\n"

His systematic work in psychology did not begin until 1924. Ten years later he died of tuberculosis at the age of only 38. In that period, with the collaboration of Aleksandre Luria and A N Leontiev, he launched a series of investigations in developmental psychology, pedagogy and psychopathology. Vygotsky ran a medical practice in his native Byelorussia, actively participating in the development of the Revolution under atrocious conditions and almost total isolation from the West. </p>\n<p>\nHis most famous work is <a href=\"../../../archive/vygotsky/works/words/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Thought and Language</span></a>, published shortly after his death, developed for the first time a theory of language development which both anticipated Piaget's genetic psychology - describing the development of language and logical thinking in young children in the course of their interactions with adults and the world around them, interiorising the practical activity expressed in semsori-motor activity, via vocialisations, inner-speech and finally thought - <em>and</em> the development of theoretical, or conceptual knowledge in school-age children as their intuitive knowledge, acquired in their immediate life experiences, comes into active contact with socially transmitted knowledge of the teacher. </p>\n<p>\nEqually renowned is <a href=\"../../../archive/vygotsky/works/crisis/psycri01.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">The Crisis in Psychology</span></a>, in which Vygotsky makes a systematic critique of all the currents and trends in European psychology of the day, including the dominant so-called Marxist psychology.

Especially in the United States, Vygotsky has found a following among Community Development workers who value his concept of a &quot;Zone of Proximal Development&quot;, in which leadership is able to facilitate intellectual and social development in struggles by communities to change their circumstances, leading to a subsequent benefit in an all-round development of conceptual ability.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/vygotsky/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Lev Vygotsky Archive</a> and <a href=\"../../../subject/psychology/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Marxism and Psychology Archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../v.htm\">Index of the Letter V</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n"

        "content": "\r\nAlfred Wagenknecht (August 15, 1881 &#8212; August 26, 1956) was an American Marxist who played a critical role in the establishment of the American Communist Party in 1919.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Socialist Years (1904-1919)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfred Wagenknecht, called &#8220;Wag&#8221; by many of his friends, was born August 15, 1881 in Goerlitz, Germany [1], the son of a shoemaker. The family emigrated to the United States in 1884, and thus the German-born Wagenknecht essentially grew up as an American, living in Cleveland before departing as a young man for Wasington state, on the West Coast. The young Wagenknecht was drawn to radical politics at an early age, serving as the Press Agent for the Seattle Local of the <a href=\"../../orgs/s/o.htm#socialist-party-america\">Socialist Party of America</a> (SPA) in 1904, one year before his marriage to Hortense Allison, sister of his party comrade Elmer Allison. Wagenknecht was prominent in the ongoing free speech fights which Local Seattle had with city officials over the right to speak in public and hold meetings on city streets and sidewalks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As was the case for many rank-and-file party members of the day, Wagenknecht was a regular candidate for public office on the Socialist ticket, running for US Congress in 1906, for Seattle Comptroller in 1908, and for Congress again in 1912. He was also a delegate from Washington state to the 1908 Convention of the Socialist Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 1913, Wagenknecht became Editor of the Everett, Washington Socialist weekly <em>The Commonwealth</em>. Shortly thereafter, Wagenknecht went to work for the National Office of the Socialist Party of America for the first time, serving as a National Organizer. In 1914, he was elected to the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party for the first time. After his stint in Chicago came to a close, Wagenknecht moved his family back to Ohio, where he was elected State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Ohio in 1917, serving through 1919. He was also a delegate to the pivotal 1917 Emergency National Convention of the SPA, held at the Planters&#8217; Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, at which the St. Louis Program against the war in Europe was adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After American entry into the war, Wagenknecht&#8217;s unyielding antimilitarism brought him into conflict wth the law. State Secretary Wagenknecht was indicted along with Local Cuyahoga County head <a href=\"../r/u.htm#ruthenberg\">C.E. Ruthenberg</a> and Ohio State Organizer Charles Baker for allegedly obstructing the draft. The trio were tried together and found guilty and sentenced to 1 year in the State Penitentiary on July 21, 1917. This decision was upheld by the US Supreme Court on Jan. 15, 1918, and the three were not released until after completion of the sentence (less time off) on Dec. 8, 1918.\r\nAlfred Wagenknecht, c. 1918</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon his release, &#8220;Wag&#8221; was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party and worked for National Office running the party&#8217;s Propaganda Department. He was an early and fierce adherent of the <a href=\"../../../history/usa/parties/spusa/1919/0500-berenberg-lwmanifesto.pdf\"><em>Left Wing Manifesto</em></a> authored by Louis C. Fraina and was active in the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, the organized faction seeking to &#8220;win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing.&#8221; Wagenknecht ran for National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party in 1919 and was the leading vote-getter in the race, which was ultimately annulled by the outgoing NEC on account of purported voting irregularities by the language federations of the party. Wagenknecht and the Left Wing attempted to establish themselves as a parallel National Executive Committee despite the outgoing NEC&#8217;s refusal to officially tabulate the vote, and the &#8220;new NEC&#8221; met one time in Chicago in August in an attempt to assert authority over the party apparatus, with Wagenknecht declaring himself &#8220;Executive Secretary Pro Tem.&#8221; This effort was rebuffed by sitting Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the party&#8217;s Regular faction, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Communist Years (1919-1956)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagenknecht was not eligible to participate in the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the SPA owing to the expulsion of the Socialist Party of Ohio from the party for their endorsement of the Left Wing Manifesto, which was portrayed by the Regular-dominated outgoing NEC as an automatic violation of the party constitution. Consequently, Wagenknecht cleverly rented a room downstairs from the SPA&#8217;s convention at Machinists&#8217; Hall in Chicago and ran a parallel convention to the official one upstairs &#8212; a gathering which was joined by a steady stream of disgruntled Left Wing delegates bolting from the official gathering. Wagenknecht presided over this alternative convention, which on Aug. 31, 1919, declared itself to be the founding convention of the  <a href=\"../../orgs/c/o.htm#clp\">Communist Labor Party of America</a>. This convention elected Wagenknecht as National Secretary of the CLP, a role which he maintained throughout the organization&#8217;s brief history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CLP was devastated by the raids of the US Department of Justice headed by A. Mitchell Palmer and his Special Assistant, J. Edgar Hoover, coordinated actions which began in the fall of 1919 and reached their zenith with a mass operation conducted during the evening of Jan. 1/2, 1919. The CLP was driven underground, local organizations broken up into secret &#8220;groups&#8221; of no more than 10 members who met furtively, using pseudonyms and attempting to avoid detection by the authorities. Wagenknecht was known variously as &#8220;Paul Holt,&#8221; &#8220;A.B. Mayer,&#8221; &#8220;A.B. Martin,&#8221; and &#8220;U.P. Duffy&#8221; during the &#8220;underground years&#8221; of 1920-1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April of 1920, Wagenknecht&#8217;s former prisonmate, turned Executive Secretary rival, C.E. Ruthenberg left the Communist Party of America (CPA) along with a number of co-thinkers and a big portion of the organization&#8217;s cash. This Ruthenberg-CPA and Wagenknecht&#8217;s CLP finally determined to achieve the organizational unity demanded by the Communist International at a secret convention held at Bridgman, Michigan at the end of May 1920. This gathering determined to retain Wagenknecht as Executive Secretary of the new organization, called the United Communist Party (UCP), assigning the important role of Editor of the party&#8217;s official newspaper, The Communist, to Ruthenberg. Wagenknecht also served on the UCP&#8217;s Editorial Committee and on the 3 member Unity Committee which continued to negotiate a merger agreement with the remaining CPA organization, headed by Charles Dirba. Unity with this group was finally forged at a May 1921 secret convention held at the Overlook Mountain House hotel near Woodstock, New York. Confusingly, this new unified organization retained the name &#8220;Communist Party of America,&#8221; the same moniker shared by the Dirba majority and the Ruthenberg minority organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The merger of the UCP meant the end of Wagenknecht&#8217;s tenure as an Executive Secretary. From June 1921, Wagenknecht served as the Manger of the unified CPA&#8217;s &#8220;legal&#8221; weekly newspaper, <em>The Toiler</em>, with Wagenknecht&#8217;s brother-in-law, Elmer Allison editing the publication. In 1922, a legal &#8220;mass organization&#8221; called the Friends of Soviet Russia was established by the unified CPA, and Wagenknecht was named by the CEC of the party to head it. He also sat on the Central Executive Committees of the (underground) unified CPA and the party&#8217;s &#8220;Legal Political Party&#8221; &#8212; the Workers Party of America (WPA) &#8212; from 1922 to 1923, when the underground party was finally dissolved. Thereafter, Wagenknecht was made the District Organizer for the tiny Wilkes Barre district of the WPA, with this job beginning in May of 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1924, Wagenknecht worked as a &#8220;Director of Special Campaigns&#8221; for the WPA, managing the fund-raising drive for <em>The Daily Worker</em>. Wagenknecht seems to have been difficult for both the Pepper-Ruthenberg-Lovestone and the Foster-Cannon-Lore factions and was shipped off to the Philippines to organize trade unions on behalf of the <a href=\"../../orgs/r/e.htm#red-international-labor-unions\">Red International of Labor Unions</a> (RILU) late in 1924.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, Wagenknecht turned his hand to drama, producing and co-starring in The Passaic Textile Strike, a semi-fictional account of the 13-month strike of 16,000 textile workers, initially led by Wagenknecht and other American Marxist and Communist leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagenknecht separated from his wife Hortense in 1930 and was finally divorced in January of 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, Wagenknecht served as the Executive Secretary of the National Committee to Aid Victims of German Fascism, a CP-sponsored &#8220;mass organization.&#8221; He was the State Chairman of the Communist Party in Missouri from 1938 to 1941 and in Illinois from 1941 to 1945. Wagenknecht remained a Communist Party loyalist for the rest of his days, dying on Aug. 26, 1956 in Illinois) and honored at his passing with a full-page photograph in Political Affairs, the theoretical monthly of the Communist Party USA.</p> \r\n<p class=\"inline\">Written by Tim Davenport</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

During a break in his studies to do military service, Weber became very close to the historian Hermann Baumgarten and his wife Ida, friends of his aunt, who stimulated Weber&#8217;s interest in the study of history. His father disapproved of this association, thus beginning a conflict with his parents that continued for many years. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1895, Weber was appointed Professor of Political Economy at Freiburg, marking his appointment with a speech delivering a devastating endictment of the ruling Junker aristocracy as historically obsolete, and the following year, was appointed to the Professorship at Heidelberg, subjecting himself to the severest of &#8220;work ethic&#8221; in his study of ancient Rome and the medieval trading societies. He was also politically active in the left-liberal Protestant Social Union. Weber actively promoted for Germany a policy of imperial expansion as the only route to genuine national maturity.</p>\n<p>\nAfter his father&#8217;s death in 1897, Weber suffered a nervous collapse and for 5 years he was intermittently institutionalised, suffering sudden relapses after slow recoveries and did not teach again until after World War I. However, it was in the period after the death of his father that Weber&#8217;s best creative work was done.</p>\n<p>\nIn his famous <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/weber/protestant-ethic/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</span></a> published in 1905, Weber attributed the success of German capitalism to the psychological consequences of Calvinism. However, when the Protestant morality that he had come to accept as inescapable destiny came under attack from young <em>avant-garde</em> literary circles such as Stefan George&#8217;s group and others, Weber began a series of discussions with Stefan George and the poet Friedrich Gundolf, which contributed much to the evolution of his ideas. </p>\n<p>\nDuring this period, Weber promoted the need for social theory to adopt a value-free methodology, and he engaged himself in comparative studies of Eastern religions with those of Christian Europe. </p>\n<p>\nIn his last years, after the War, he criticised Germany&#8217;s annexationist war goals and argued for a strengthened parliament; he assisted in the drafting of the new constitution and in the founding of the German Democratic Party. </p>\n<p class=\"fst\">\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/weber/index.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Max Weber Archive</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n"

Wells&#8217;s best-known books are <em>The Time Machine</em> (1895), <em>The Invisible Man</em> (1897), and <em>The War Of The Worlds</em> (1898).</p>\n<p>\nH.G. Wells was born on September 21, 1866 in Bromley, Kent. His father was a shopkeeper and a professional cricketer, and his mother served from time to time as a housekeeper at the nearby estate of Uppark. His father&#8217;s business failed and Wells was apprenticed like his brothers to a draper, spending the years between 1880 and 1883 in Windsor and Southsea. Later he recorded these years in Kipps (1905).</p>\n<p>\nIn 1883 Wells became a teacher-pupil at Midhurst Grammar School. He obtained a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London and studied biology under T.H. Huxley. However, his interest faltered and in 1887 he left without a degree. He taught in private schools for four years, not taking his B.S. degree until 1890. Next year he settled in London, married his cousin Isabel and continued his career as a teacher in a correspondence college. From 1893 Wells became a full-time writer. After some years Wells left Isabel for one of his brightest students, Amy Catherine, whom he married in 1895. </p>\n<p>\nAs a novelist Wells made his debut with <em>The Time Machine</em> (1895), a parody of English class division and a satirical warning that human progress is not inevitable. The work was followed by such science-fiction classics as <em>The Island Of Dr. Moreau</em> (1896), The Invisible Man (1897) and <em>The War of the Worlds</em> (1898). <em>The First Men On The Moon</em> (1901) was a prophetic description of the methodology of space flight and <em>The War In The Air</em> (1908) describes a catastrophic aerial war. <em>Love And Mr. Lewisham</em> appeared in 1900, <em>Tono-Bungay</em> and <em>The History Of Mr. Polly</em> in 1909. Wells also published critical pamphlets attacking the Victorian social order, among them <em>Anticipations</em> (1901), <em>Mankind In The Making</em> (1903) and <em>A Modern Utopia</em> (1905).</p>\n<p>\nPassionate concern for society led Wells to join the socialist Fabian Society in London, but he soon quarreled with the society&#8217;s leaders, among them George Bernard Shaw. This experience was basis for his novel The New Machiavelli (1911), where he drew portraits of the noted Fabians. After WWI Wells published several non-fiction works, among them <em>The Outline Of History</em> (1920), <em>The Science Of Life</em> (1929-39) and <em>Experiment In Autobiography</em> (1934). In 1917 Wells was a member of Research Committee for the League of Nations and published several books about the world organization. Between the years 1924 and 1933 Wells lived mainly in France. From 1934 to 1946 he was the International president of PEN (organisation which supports writers suffering repression). </p>\n<p>\nIn <em>The Holy Terror</em> (1939) Wells studied the psychological development of a modern dictator based on the careers of Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler. Wells lived through World War II in his house on Regent&#8217;s Park, refusing to let the blitz drive him out of London.</p>\n<p>\nHis last book, <em>Mind At The End Of Its Tether</em> (1945), expressed pessimism about mankind&#8217;s future prospects.

The founding convention elected Wicks to the Central Executive Committee of the CPA, which in turn elected him to its governing inner circle, the Executive Council.[1] Wicks was the only member of the Michigan tendency to accept office in the new CPA. He also served as Associate Editor of the party&#8217;s official organ, The Communist. Wicks was jailed in Nov. 1919 in connection with these activities as part of the Justice Department&#8217;s crackdown on members of the Communist Party.</p>\r\n<p>In 1920, Wicks rejoined his Michigan comrades when he became a member of the Proletarian Party of America, serving on the governing National Executive Committee of that organization. Wicks was the fraternal delegate of the PPA to the founding convention of the Workers Party of America in Dec. 1921, but he came as a foe rather than a friend, engaging in a bitter criticism of that organization. After the Proletarian Party&#8217;s decision to support the legal arm of the Central Caucus faction&#8217;s &#8220;Communist Party of America&#8221; in 1922, Wicks was named as the editor of the organ of this \"United Toilers of America,\" <em>The Workers&#8217; Challenge</em>. </p>\r\n<p>Wicks joined the Workers Party following the liquidation of the Central Caucus split in the fall of 1922 and served on the CEC of WPA from 1922 to 1923. He also served on the editorial board of The Worker during that same period. In 1923 Wicks was named National Organizer of the WPA and conducted a 5 week East Coast speaking tour in Sept.-Oct. 1923.</p>\r\n<p>Wicks was first accused of being a spy in 1923, charged with having denounced Communist Labor Party founding member Victor Saulit to immigration authorities while both were members of the Socialist Party of Oregon. A WPA inquest commission cleared Wicks of this charge, however.</p>\r\n<p>Wicks was a delegate to the 3rd Convention of the WPA in 1923 and was a consistent backer of the Pepper-Ruthenberg faction. In 1928 Wicks was a delegate to the 6th World Congress of the Comintern. He remained in Moscow for a year as North American representative to the Profintern. Thereafter, Wicks was sent to Australia and various Asian countries as a Comintern Representative.</p>\r\n<p>Wicks returned to the United States in the middle 1930s, standing as the CPUSA candidate for US Senate from Pennsylvania in 1934.

        "content": "\r\nDavid Widgery was a loyal but extremely heterodox member of the British IS and then the SWP from the late 1960s until his tragic early death in 1992. </p>\r\n<p>He had a wide range of interests and activities. From his youth a cultural radical he wrote not only for the revolutionary press but also for the underground press of the late 1960s, editing one issue of the famous underground magazine <em>OZ</em> as well as writing regularly for <em>Socialist Worker</em> and <em>International Socialism</em>. </p>\r\n<p>He was from the beginning a campaigner for women&#8217;s liberation (one of the few men actually invited to attend the First Women&#8217;s Liberation Conference at Ruskin College, Oxford in 1970) and was one of the first advocates of gay liberation in the left press in Britain. </p>\r\n<p>After qualifying as a doctor, despite involvement in a bewildering variety of campaigns during his studies, he became an activist around health issues and a campaigner against welfare cuts, first as a hospital doctor and then as a general practitioner in London&#8217;s East End. Despite a gruelling timetable due to his demanding work he nevertheless found time to be one of the founder members of Rock Against Racism in the mid-1970s. Along with the Anti-Nazi League RAR played an important role in ensuring that the National Front (a fascist organisation) was beaten back. In particular it intervened in the emerging punk scene, where many leading lights initially used swastikas as a provocation against good taste, and ensured that it became dominated by anti-racist and anti-fascist ideas. By its integration of reggae it ensured a cross-over which eventually resulted in the development of Two-Tone, committed anti-racist and anti-Conservative music that brightened up the dark days of Thatcherism in the 1980s. </p>\r\n<p>Not only was he an activist, he was also a chronicler of the movement, particular his collection &#8220;The Left in Britain 1956-1968&#8221; and &#8220;Beating Time,&#8221; his history of RAR and the fight against the NF. But he also chronicled the movement in a wide range of magazines and papers ranging from the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (about as Establishment as you can get) via <em>New Statesman</em> and <em>New Society</em>, <em>Time Out</em> and <em>City Limits</em> to <em>Socialist Worker</em>, <em>Freindz</em> and <em>INK</em>. Among his other works are a number of heavyweight analyses of the politics of health and particularly of the National Health Service in Britain, numerous short pieces on culture and descriptive writing of aspects of working class life that have rarely been captured so brilliantly. He was one of the finest left writers in Britain ever. </p>\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"../../../archive/widgery/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">David Widgery Archive</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His father was Sir William Wilde, an Irish antiquarian, gifted writer, and specialist in diseases of the eye and ear, who founded a hospital in Dublin. </p>\r\n<p>Wilde studied at Portora Royal School, in Enniskillen, Trinity College, Dublin, and Magdalen College, Oxford (1874-78). In Oxford Wilde shocked the pious dons with his irreverent attitude towards religion and was jeered at his eccentric clothes. He collected blue china and peacock&#8217;s feathers, and later his velvet knee-breeches drew much attention. In 1878 Wilde received his B.A. and on the same year he moved to London. His lifestyle and humorous wit made him soon spokesman for Aestheticism, the late 19th century movement in England that advocated art for art&#8217;s sake. He worked as art reviewer (1881), lectured in the United States and Canada (1882), and lived in Paris (1883). Between the years 1883 and 1884 he lectured in Britain. From the mid-1880s he was regular contributor for <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> and <i>Dramatic View</i>. </p>\r\n<p>Before his theatrical success Wilde produced several essays, many of these anonymously. His two major literary-theoretical works were the dialogues &#8216;The Decay of Lying&#8217; (1889) and &#8216;The Critic as Artist&#8217; (1890). In the latter Wilde lets his character state, that criticism is the superior part of creation, and that the critic must not be fair, rational, and sincere, but possessed of &#8220;a temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty.&#8221; In a more traditional essay <i>The Soul of a Man Under Socialism</i> (1891) Wilde takes an optimistic view of the road to socialist future. He rejects the Christian ideal of self-sacrifice in favor of joy. </p>\r\n<p>His intimate association with Alfred Douglas led to his trial on charges of homosexuality and he was sentenced two years hard labour for the crime of sodomy. Wilde was first in Wandsworth prison, London, and then Reading Gaol. When he was at last allowed pen and paper after more than 19 months of deprivation, Wilde had became inclined to take opposite views on the potential of humankind toward perfection. After his release in 1897 Wilde lived under the name Sebastian Melmoth in Berneval, near Dieppe, then in Paris. He wrote <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol,</i> revealing his concern for inhumane prison conditions. It is said, that on his death bed Wilde became a Roman Catholic. He died of cerebral meningitis on November 30, 1900, penniless, in a cheap Paris hotel at the age of 46. </p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">The Soul of Man Under Socialism</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

She joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1907 and, in 1912, she became a member of the National Union of Women&#8217;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and the following year was recruited as one of its district organisers. In 1915, became National Women&#8217;s Organiser and the first woman to employed as an official by the Amalgamated Union of Cooperative Employees, which eventually joined the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers (NUDAW) that, as a result of various merger, became today’s USDAW. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe gave wholehearted support to the Non-Conscription Fellowship during the First World War and joined the Communist Party at its foundation and, in 1921 attended the founding conference of the Red International of Labour Unions in Moscow, She was still a member when elected to Manchester City Council in 1923 on a Labour ticket. She left the Party in 1924, after she was elected as an MP for Middlesborough East and remained vaguely on the left of Labour. Small and fiery, with red hair (inevitably she was dubbed &#8216;Red Ellen&#8217;!), she was a fluent speaker and writer, with an impish sense of humour and a lively temperament.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the 1924 General Election she was elected to represent Middlesborough East but she opposed the National Government formed by MacDonald and as a result lost her seat in the 1931 election. She had a novel called &#8220;Clash&#8221;, published in 1929, &#8220;Peeps at Politicians&#8221; in 1931 and &#8220;The Terror in Germany&#8221; in 1933, as well as a novel entitled &#8220;The Division Bell Mystery&#8221; in 1932. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe re-entered Parliament as MP for Jarrow in the 1935 General Election. Jarrow had one of the worst unemployment records in Britain. In October 1936 a march of 200 unemployed workers went from Jarrow to London, where Wilkinson presented a petition to parliament and later wrote an account of the Jarrow Crusade and its outcome called &#8216;The Town That Was Murdered&#8217; (1939). \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe was a member of the International Commission of Enquiry into the Reichstag Fire; she often visited Spain, both before and after the Spanish Civil War in 1937, and was active in Spanish relief committees. Her support for anti-fascist unity put her in a state of some tension with Labour&#8217;s leadership. But she was made Minister of Education in the 1945 Labour government. However, her plan to increase the school-leaving age to sixteen was abandoned in favour of fifteen, when the government decided that the measure would be too expensive. However, she did persuade Parliament to pass the 1946 School Milk Act that gave free milk to all British schoolchildren. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeemingly, Wilkinson became depressed over the course of her career and the failure to achieve serious reforms as a Labour politician, allegedly taking an overdose of barbiturates and as a result dying on 6 February 1947.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"inline\">From <a href=\"http://graham.thewebtailor.co.uk/\">Graham Stevenson</a></p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../archive/wilkinson/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Ellen Wilkinson Archive</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There, Winternitz attended high school and began studying philosophy, mathematics and physics at the university in Prague. In 1917 he drafted into the Austrian army. Received his Ph.D. in philosophy at the Berlin University in 1920</p>\r\n<p>A member of the social-democratic workers party from 1918, he joined  the Spartakusbund and the Unified Communist Party of Germany (VKPD) and the CP of the CSR from its inception in 1921. Working as a scientist, he was also active in the Communist Party, 1921/22 as editor-in-chief of the newspaper &#8220;Vorwärts&#8221; in Reichenberg. 1923 Moved to Germany, as a full-time official of the KPD, on whose left wing he played an important role. Winternitz became &#8211; under the most different pseudonyms: Lenz, Sommer u.a. &#8211; the theoretician of the left in the KPD. In 1924, working with the central committee of the KPD, head of department for propaganda in the headquarters, delegate of the 5th World Congress of the Comintern, he sympathized briefly with the ultra-left, but remained attached to the left tendency organized around Ruth Fischer.</p>\r\n<p>At the KPD Xth Congress (<em>Parteitag</em>) in 1925 as Secretary of the Political Commission, he was elected as a candidate in the Central Committee. After the &#8220;Open Letter&#8221; in 1925 (which he declined) he defended Ruth Fischer and Arkady Maslow against their replacement at the chair of the party by Ernst Thälmann by order of Stalin. At first he distinguished himself from the group of ultra-leftists around Werner Scholem, but later also from Ruth Fischer, remained in the KPD and adapted to the party line. For this reason, in 1927, at the XIth Congress, he was again nominated as a candidate to the Central Committee, but until 1928 exercised only subordinate functions in the CC apparatus. </p>\r\n<p>Among other, he was editor of the magazine \"<em>Internationale</em>&#8221; and director of the \"<em>Rhein-Ruhr-Pressedienst</em>\" in Düsseldorf. After the Wittorf affair, he returned to the foreground, became head of the agitprop department of the Central Committee. The XII Party Congress 1929 elected him as a member of the Central Committee. In 1931, Winternitz (this time under the pseudonym Kraus) was head of the ZK&#8217;s propaganda department, but in December 1931 he and Alexander Emel were removed from their leading posts in the CC for allegedly &#8220;misinterpreting&#8221; Stalin and &#8220;vilifying&#8221; Lenin. As a result, Winternitz-Kraus practiced self-criticism: &#8220;<em>I fully and unconditionally recognize in the article of the Gen. Thälmann ... criticized mistakes in my work ...</em> &#8220;Winternitz remained in Germany until 1933. During the arguments over the succession by Ernst Thälmanns he joined and became a close collaborator to Walter Ulbricht (who became GDR head of state from 1960 until his death in 1973). In 1934 Winternitz emigrated to Czechoslovakia, and in 1939 to Great Britain and worked in the British Communist Party during the war. There he was editor of the antinazi journal &#8220;<em>Scheinwerfer über Deutschland&#8221; </em>and contributor to &#8220;<em>Labour Monthly</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>World News and Views</em>&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>In March 1948, he returned to Germany, became a member of the SED (the communist party of the GDR) and led until February 1950, the <em>Research Institute for Scientific Socialism</em> in Kleinmachnow and the <em>Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin Institut </em>attached to the CC of the SED.  But soon, by decision of the Politbureau of February 21, 1950, he was dismissed as leader and reprimanded because in an article in the  journal &#8220;<em>Einheit&#8221; </em>(&#8220;Learning from Stalin&#8221;) which, in the opinion of the Central Committee, &#8220;unintentionally supported the campaign of the imperialists and Tito agents against Stalin&#8221; (He was accused for having quoted in it anti-Leninist views of a younger Stalin). </p>\r\n<p>Appointed in March 1950 Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the Humboldt University in East Berlin, he preferred to return to England in 1951. As a reason, he stated concern for his family living there. After all, he knew the Stalinist methods too well and knew how such &#8220;ideological attacks&#8221; ended.</p>\r\n<p> Joseph Winternitz died on March 22, 1952 in London. </p>\r\n<p>The SED dedicated an obituary to him, but noted that he was &#8220;not completely free of certain fluctuations.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Biographical information from: <em>Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten</em> (Handbook of the German Communists) and <em>Wer war wer in der DDR</em> (Who was who in the GDR).   https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363;-1424.html?ID=3833</p>\r\n<h5>Publications</h5>\r\n<p class=\"information\"><em>Was wollen die Kommunisten?</em>  Berlin: Vereinig Internationaler Verl.

He was involved in German radical political and social movements at an early age. He joined the German Youth Movement, and in 1917 he was drafted into the German Army Signal Corps. In November, 1918, he joined the Independent Socialist party and two years later, became an active member of the German Communist Party (KDP). He was a playwright in his youth and wrote several essays and novels with a Communist theme.  In 1920-1921, he was a high school teacher in Tinz, and studied at Frankfurt University under Carl Grünberg who was to be Director of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, published his first analysis of ancient Chinese society in 1926 and gained his PhD in 1928 and was invited to join the Institut for Social Research in Frankfurt. Wittfogel's first wife, Rose Schlesinger whom he married in 1921, also took up a position as librarian at the Institut. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nWittfogel, in his paper <em>Geopolitics, Geographical Materialism, and Marxism</em>, criticized those who suggested Marx did not fully examine the role of nature in social development, but criticised the theories of some bourgeois historians who assigned nature a determinant role in the formation of social systems. He believed that geographical factors, such as location, race, soil, physical terrain and climate played a secondary role in determining social structure. He drew on the categories of huamnity, nature, labor and production as conceived by Orthodox Marxism, and viewed &#8220;geopolitics&#8221; as unscientific and worthless. </p>\r\n<p>In 1931, the Institut published Wittfogel's <em>Economy and Society in China</em>, after which he abandoned scholarly work to devote himself to political work against the Nazis. However, the Nazi triumph placed him in great danger. Trying to escape Germany, he was arrested and sent to prison and concentration camps. His second wife, Olga Lang (originally Olga Joffe, herself later an expert on Chinese affairs, whom he married in 1933) worked to secure his release, as did R. H. Tawney in England and Karl Haushofer in Germany. Wittfogel was freed in November 1933, and emigrated to England. In 1934, he went on to the United States where he became a naturalized citizen in 1939. He rejoined other exiled members of the Institut and taught at the University of Washington and Columbus University, travelling frequently to China during the period 1935-39. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs Professor for Chinese history at University of Washington in Seattle, he published <em>Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power</em> in 1957. The book examines the origins of complex societies and states. Historical in nature, the book identifies the management of water as a method by which the Chinese emperors to exercised power. He designated this type of ancient societies as &#8220;hydraulic societies.&#8221;  He thought that the development of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China and Pre-columbian societies had been blocked because of the need to irrigate vast surfaces for agriculture.

        "content": "\r\nAustrian philosopher and logician, founder of Analytical Philosophy, attempted to extend Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead's ill-fated attempt to reduce all of mathematics to a single, exhaustive and non-contradictory logical system to philosophy as a whole by means of a &#8220;logically perfect\" or &#8220;ideal\" language, which simply excluded those concepts which could not be fitted into the &#8220;perfect\" language. After World War One, his thinking took a new track, in which he now focussed more or less on the impossibility of the task he had previously been absorbed with.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe son of a wealthy Austrian industrialist, he was educated at home until the age of 14, and later studied mechanical engineering in Berlin and went on to the University of Manchester, to join a reaearch team in aeronautical engineering, where he was involved in advanced propellor design, and it was this work that aroused his interest in mathematics, and soon led him to problems of the foundations of mathematics. Abandoning engineering in 1911, he went to Cambridge to study logic with Bertrand Russell. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a couple of years at Cambridge, Wittgenstein went to live in seclusion in Norway, working on logic. On the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein enlisted in the Austrian army and was sent to the Italian front. Throughout the war, Wittgenstein continued to work on problems of logic and philosophy. When he was taken prisoner at the end of the war, he had the completed manuscript of <span class=\"book\">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span>, which he sent to Russell who managed to get it published in 1921.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe <span class=\"book\">Tractatus</span> is a series of remarks on language dissecting the many shades of meaning and exploring the limitations of what can be said and what can be understood.  Wittgenstein proposed to solve this problem by viewing propositions as &#8220;pictures of situations in the world&#8221; made up of <em>signs</em> that had to be correlated with simple elements of reality in order to understand the connection between the words and the reality they referred to. Wittgenstein then aimed to make a logical analysis on the basis of the logical form of these signs and the corresponding logical forms of the elements of reality that they signified. The key to this analysis had to be the uncovering of the particular logical form common to both reality and language, which made the correlation possible. Wittgenstein held that, on the bais of logical considerations, this common logical form cannot itself be represented.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFeeling that the <span class=\"book\">Tractatus</span> had exhausted his contributions to philosophy, Wittgenstein became a school teacher, working in various villages in Austria, only occasionally meeting with other philosophers, particularly those of the <a href=\"../../orgs/v/i.htm#vienna-circle\">Vienna Circle</a>; he became very depressed and frequently thought of suicide. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1929, Wittgenstein returned to lecture at Cambridge, where the notes taken by his students, gradually came to build a considerable reputation for him. Until his death in 1951, Wittgenstein continued to feel himself an outsider, and always regarded his own work as unsatisfactory and incomplete, but he now wrote prodigiously, and his <em>magnum opus</em>, the <span class=\"book\">Philosophical Investigations</span>, published only after his death, is highly regarded to this day. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this later period of his work, Wittgenstein came to reject his former conception, holding rather that there is <em>no</em> unity hidden in the diversity of language, and his lectures ruthlessly break down and destroy every attempt to generalise or say something definite or provable or rule-governed about language; the most that could be said about a number of things that in some way were deemed to fall into the same category was that there was a &#8220;family resemblance&#8221;, and the only meaning in the connection between words and concepts is their connection to human life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"fst\">\r\n<em>Further Reading:</em> <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/at/wittgens.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Lectures in Philosophy</span></a>.

He was ordained in\n1896 and served for two years as a preacher before going to study in Toronto and Oxford,\nEngland.  Discovering the plight of the East London slums, he wrote that he could never\nagain contemplate beauty and culture without being aware of human wreckage.  He\nreturned to Canada, where he worked with urban immigrant slum dwellers.  He managed\nand transformed  the \"All Peoples&#8217; Mission\" in North Winnipeg and expounded the\n\"social gospel,\" calling for the establishment of the Kingdom of God \"here and now.\"\nHe described the poverty and suffering of immigrant workers in a number of books,\nincluding \"Strangers Within Our Gates\" (1909) and \"My Neighbour\" (1911).\n</p>\n<p>\nBy 1914 he had become a democratic socialist and he opposed the First World War as a\nproduct of capitalism and imperialist competition.  Because of this, and particularly his\nopposition to conscription, the Canadian government fired him from his job at the Bureau\nof Social Research in 1917. Frail and underweight, with six children to support, he made\nhis way to Vancouver, where he worked as a longshoreman.  He organized for the\nrecently formed Federated Labour Party.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1918, because of its support for the War and position on social issues, he resigned\nfrom the Methodist Church and began a tour as a speaker and advocate for working\npeople.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1919 a General Strike of about 30,000 workers broke out in Winnipeg.  Woodsworth\nbriefly edited the  \"Strike Bulletin\" of the \"Western Labour News,\" was arrested and\ncharged with seditious libel.  The prosecution was never pursued.\n</p>\n<p>\nWoodsworth&#8217;s role in the strike had been minor but established a firm reputation for him\namong supporters of labour.  In 1921 the Independent Labour Party was formed in\nWinnipeg and Woodsworth ran for election in Winnipeg North Centre.  The party was\nbased, in part, on the British Labour Party and rejected violence and any ties with the\nCommunist Party.  Woodsworth was elected and held this seat through five federal\nelections.  This was the first time in Canadian history that Labour MPs, without Liberal\nor Conservative ties, were elected to the House of Commons.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1926, holding the balance of Parliamentary power with one other Labour MP,\nWoodsworth secured the commitment of the Liberal government to pass old age pension\nlegislation. Canada&#8217;s old age pension plan was thus introduced.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1932, when Canada&#8217;s first major social democratic party, the Cooperative\nCommonwealth Federation (CCF), was established Woodsworth became its first\nPresident.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe expressed his political philosophy as follows:\n</p>\n<p class=\"quote\">\n\"I refuse to follow slavishly the British model or the American model or the Russian\nmodel.

Woodsworth,\nmaintained his pacifist position.  Barely able to see, and partly paralyzed by a stroke, he\nwas alone in the House of Commons in opposing the declaration of war.  The CCF&#8217;s\nofficial position supported the declaration of war while attaching conditions to Canada&#8217;s\nparticipation in it.  Woodsworth resigned from the leadership of the party and in spite of\nhis position on the War was reelected to Parliament in 1940.

        "content": "\nDaughter of a handkerchief weaver, was born in Spitalfields, London in 1759. The family moved a great deal during Mary&#8217;s childhood and she lived for periods at Epping, Barking, Beverley, Hoxton, Walworth and Laugharne in Wales.</p>\n<p>\nIn 1784, Mary Wollstonecraft opened a school in Newington Green, a small village close to Hackney, with her sister Eliza and a friend, Fanny Blood. Soon after arriving in Newington Green, Mary made friends with Richard Price, a minister at the local Dissenting Chapel. Price and his friend, Joseph Priestly, were the leaders of a group of men known as Rational Dissenters. Price had written several books including the very influential <em>Review of the Principal Questions of Morals</em> (1758) where he argued that individual conscience and reason should be used when making moral choices. Price also rejected the traditional Christian ideas of original sin and eternal punishment. As a result of these religious views, some Anglicans accused Rational Dissenters of being atheists. </p>\n<p>\nAlthough Mary was brought up as an Anglican, she soon began attending Richard Price&#8217;s chapel. Price held radical political views and had encountered a great deal of hostility when he supported the cause of American independence. At Price&#8217;s home Mary Wollstonecraft met other leading radicals including the publisher, Joseph Johnson. He was impressed by Mary&#8217;s ideas on education and commissioned her to write a book on the subject. In <em>Thoughts on the Education of Girls</em>, published in 1786, Mary attacked traditional teaching methods and suggested new topics that should be studied by girls. Two years later Wollstonecraft helped Johnson to found the journal <em>Analytical Review</em>. </p>\n<p>\nIn November, 1789, Richard Price preached a sermon praising the French Revolution. Price argued that British people, like the French, had the right to remove a bad king from the throne. Edmund Burke, was appalled by this sermon and wrote a reply called Reflections on the Revolution in France where he argued in favour of the inherited rights of the monarchy. Wollstonecraft was upset by Burke&#8217;s attack on her friend and she decided to defend him by writing a pamphlet A Vindication of the Rights of Man. In her pamphlet Wollstonecraft not only supported Price but also pointed out what she thought was wrong with society. This included the slave trade, the game laws and way that the poor were treated.</p>\n<p>\nThe publication of <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Man</em> brought Wollstonecraft to the attention of other radical thinkers such as Tom Paine, John Cartwright, John Horne Tooke, William Godwin and William Blake. Wollstonecraft met several of these men including Godwin who was busily writing a book on Political Justice. In 1791 the first part of Tom Paine&#8217;s Rights of Man was published. This book created a burst of radical activity and although Paine was forced to flee the country, others were determined to carry on the struggle in England. Soon after Rights of Man appeared, two of Britain&#8217;s leading Rational Dissenters, Richard Price and Joseph Priestly, formed the Unitarian Society, an organisation that was to have a profound influence on religious and political ideas in Britain.</p>\n<p>\nThe following year Mary Wollstonecraft published her most important book, <em><a href=\"../../../reference/archive/wollstonecraft-mary/1792/vindication-rights-woman/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Vindication of the Rights of Women</a></em>. In the book Wollstonecraft attacked the educational restrictions that kept women in a state of &#8220;ignorance and slavish dependence.&#8221; She was especially critical of a society that encouraged women to be &#8220;docile and attentive to their looks to the exclusion of all else.&#8221; Wollstonecraft described marriage as &#8220;legal prostitution&#8221; and added that women &#8220;may be convenient slaves, but slavery will have its constant effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\nThe ideas in Wollstonecraft&#8217;s book were truly revolutionary and caused tremendous controversy. One critic described Wollstonecraft as a &#8220;hyena in petticoats.&#8221; Mary Wollstonecraft argued that to obtain social equality society must rid itself of the monarchy as well as the church and military hierarchies. Mary Wollstonecraft&#8217;s views even shocked fellow radicals. Whereas advocates of parliamentary reform such as Jeremy Bentham and John Cartwright had rejected the idea of female suffrage, Wollstonecraft argued that the rights of man and the rights of women were one and the same thing. </p>\n<p>\nIn 1793 Edmund Burke led the attack on the radicals in Britain. He described the London Corresponding Society and the Unitarian Society as &#8220;loathsome insects that might, if they were allowed, grow into giant spiders as large as oxen.&#8221; King George III issued a proclamation against seditious writings and meetings, threatening serious punishments for those who refused to accept his authority. </p>\n<p>\nIn June, 1793 Mary decided to move to France with the American writer, Gilbert Imlay. The following year, Mary gave birth to Fanny. After her relationship with Imlay came to an end she returned to London. Mary married William Godwin in March, 1797 and soon afterwards, a second daughter, Mary, was born. The baby was healthy but the placenta was retained in the womb. The doctor&#8217;s attempt to remove the placenta resulted in blood poisoning and Mary died on 10th September, 1797. </p>\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../reference/archive/wollstonecraft-mary/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Mary Wollstonecraft Archive</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"inline\">\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/\">Spartacus</a></p>\n \n<p>&#160;</p>\n"

Wundt proposed that two different sciences were required for the study of the human mind: Experimental Psychology and <em>Völkerpsychologie</em>. Experimental or &#8220;subjective&#8221; psychology aimed to trace elementary psychic experiences and reactions to physiological processes using introspection of trained subjects. <em>Völkerpsychologie</em> covered the territory that Dilthey had opened up in his descriptive psychology.</p>\n<p>Graduating in medicine from the University of Heidelberg in 1856, Wundt studied briefly with Johannes Müller, before joining the University of Heidelberg, where he became an assistant to <a href=\"../../people/h/e.htm#helmholtz-hermann\">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> in 1858. There he wrote &#8220;Contributions to the Theory of Sense Perception&#8221; (1858-62).</p>\n<p>It was during this period that Wundt offered the first course ever taught in scientific psychology. Until then, psychology had been regarded as a branch of philosophy to be conducted primarily by rational analysis. Wundt instead stressed the use of experimental methods drawn from the natural sciences. His lectures on psychology were published as &#8220;Lectures on the Mind of Humans and Animals&#8221; (1863). </p>\n<p>Bypassed in 1871 for the appointment to succeed Helmholtz, Wundt then applied himself to writing a work that came to be one of the most important in the history of psychology, &#8220;Principles of Physiological Psychology&#8221; (1874). The &#8220;Principles&#8221; advanced a system of psychology that sought to investigate the immediate experiences of consciousness, including sensations, feelings, volitions, apperception and ideas using <em>introspection</em>. </p>\n<p>Wundt recognized the two different objective processes involved in Psychology: culture and physiology. The physiological basis of psychology could be studied by methods of introspection. <em>Völkerpsychologie</em>, however, could not be studied by laboratory methods because the higher psychological functions extend beyond individual human consciousness, for example, in the construction of languages and social institutions. <em>Völkerpsychologie</em> requires the use of a developmental-historical methodology, and must therefore incorporate ethnology, the &#8220;science of the origins of peoples.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"indentb\">&#8220;Its problem relates to those mental products which are created by a community of human life and are, therefore, inexplicable in terms merely of individual consciousness, since they presuppose the reciprocal action of many ... Individual consciousness is wholly incapable of giving us a history of the development of human thought, for it is conditioned by an earlier history concerning which it cannot give us any knowledge.&#8221; </p>\n<p>In 1871, Wundt began publication of a scientific journal of psychology, &#8220;Philosophical Studies.&#8221; In 1875 he took up a position at the University of Leipzig and in 1879, established the first psychological laboratory in the world, where the founders of both American and Russian Behavourism, Edward Titchener and Vladimir Bekhterev, studied. </p>\n<p>See Wundt's 1896 <a href=\"../../../reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/wundt.htm\" target=\"_top\"><span class=\"book\">Outline of Psychology</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p> \n<hr />\n<p class=\"footer\">\n<a href=\"../../w.htm\">Index of the Letter W</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

He was sent to the prestigious Doshisha high school in where he converted to Christianity. After dropping out of high school he moved to Tokyo where he helped pen an article that spoke poorly of the crown prince&#8217;s marriage. For this he was sentence to two years in jail for l&egrave;se majestv. After being released in 1903 he visited the offices of the radical paper Heimin Shinbun where he met Kotoku Shusui, a leading socialist radical. He then moved back to the countryside and established a drugstore. In the next few years he dropped his Christian religion and decided to dedicate himself to socialism, he thus returned to Tokyo in 1907 to join the Heimin Shinbun as a journalist.</p>\n<p>There he converted to Anarcho-Syndicalism under the influence of Kotoku. In 1911 Kotoku was arrested and executed for an alleged plot to assassinate the emperor. Authorities used the opportunity to crack down on dissent and Yamakawa was sentenced to a few years in jail. In 1918 he converted to Bolshevism, in July 1922 he became one of the chief founders of the Komintern backed Japanese Communist Party (JCP). During that time Yamakawa wrote A change of course for the proletarian movement, which was essentially an attack on the Anarchro-Syndicalists. Yamakawa however was not a Leninist and refused to accept the idea of a revolutionary vanguard.</p>\n<p>By 1924 he led a faction to dissolve the party arguing that the time was not right for a Communist Party in Japan. His approach was later labelled &#8220;Yamakawaism&#8221; and was considered revisionist by JCP supporters. In 1927 he was one of the leading founders of the journal Rono (labour-farmer), a Marxist journal that opposed the Komintern interpretation of Japanese history. He retired from active politics in 1931, was arrested with most other Rono members in 1937 and spent the rest of the war in jail. He became a senior advisor to Socialist and labour movements in Post-war Japan. He died from cancer in 1958, his wife; Yamakawa Kikue (1890-1980) was a leading theorist of Feminism in Japan.</p>\n<p class=\"fst\">See <a href=\"../../../subject/japan/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Marxism in Japan Archive</a>.</p>\n\n"

The son of a Jewish petty bourgeois family, he had no formal education but was taught at home, and started work as a teacher at the age of 15. He soon took an active part in the strike struggles which broke out in 1900-1901, and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1901.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring 1902 he went abroad to Berlin and Paris, then studied for a time in the University of Heme: while in Switierland he met Lenin and Plekhanov early in 1903. During August of that year he attended the historic second Social Democratic Labour Party Congress in London, when the split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks took place. Zinoviev immediately supported the Bolsheviks and joined their faction; after the congress he was sent back to Russia as a party worker, but his health was poor and he had to return abroad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn 1905 he went again to Russia and took a leading part in the St. Petersburg party organization, publishing the newspaper <em>Proletary</em>. Throughout 1906 he carried out agitation among the St. Petersburg metal workers, who sent him as their delegate to the Fifth Party Congress of May 1907 in London, where he was elected for the first time to the Central Committee. The next year he was arrested for his revolutionary activities, but was released on the grounds of his ill-health; he then went to Switzerland and became Lenin&#8217;s closest collaborator from that time until 1917. He was the only Bolshevik to support Lenin in 1910 against those who advocated compromising with the Mensheviks and retaining the joint central committee (during this period the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were formally in the same organization). In 1911 he lectured at Lenin&#8217;s party school for Bolshevik underground workers, held at Longjumeau, near Paris.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the Sixth Party Conference in Prague during January 1912 he was elected to the new all-Bolshevik Central Committee.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring the First World War he took a clear internationalist stand, representing the Bolshevik party at the 1915 Zimmerwald conference against the war, and the Kienthal conference of 1916; he helped to organize the &#8216;Zimmerwald Left&#8217; which called for the imperialist war to be turned into a civil war. Together with Lenin he wrote the pamphlet <em>Socialism and the War</em> (1915) and a collection of articles, <em>Against the Current</em> (1916) which attacked the social-patriotic betrayal of the reformist parties in the Second International.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the February revolution of 1917 he returned to Russia with Lenin, but, like the other leading Bolsheviks, initially opposed Lenin&#8217;s &#8216;April Theses&#8217; which called for the overthrow of the bourgeois Provisional Government. He went underground with Lenin during the &#8216;July Days&#8217;, when the Provisional Government clamped down on the Bolsheviks; they were both forced to hide in Finland, and returned to Petrograd only in October.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt this point, faced with the immediate necessity of taking power, Zinoviev, along with Kamenev, came out openly against the insurrection. He and Kamenev published an article in the non-party press which exposed the Bolshevik&#8217;s plans for the insurrection; for this Lenin denounced them as &#8216;strike breakers&#8217; and proposed their expulsion from the party, a demand which was later dropped.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the October revolution, Zinoviev advocated a coalition government to include the Mensheviks and SRs and resigned from the Central Committee in protest against Lenin&#8217;s resolution excluding these parties, but returned within a few days.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNevertheless he became one of the Soviet regime&#8217;s principal figures; at first the chief party spokesman in the Trade Union Central Council, he presided at all the early trade union congresses, and was later elected president of the Petrograd Soviet. Petrograd was the centre of the metal-working industries where the core of Bolshevik trade union cadres were concentrated, and where Zinoviev had considerable support within the party.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen the government was transferred to Moscow during the Civil War, he was appointed chairman of the Northern Commune: at this time he was also a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the 7th Army and president of the Committee for the Defence of the Republic. At the Eighth Party Congress in March 1919 he was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and a full member at the Tenth Congress in1921.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the Comintern&#8217;s foundation in 1919, on Lenin&#8217;s motion he was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. One of his biggest achievements was to win the majority of the German Independent Social-Democratic Party for fusion with the new German Communist Party (KPD) in 1920, after a four-hour speech in German! However, against Trotsky&#8217;s opposition to an adventure, he and Bela Kun instigated the abortive rising in Germany in 1921, believing that this would &#8216;electrify&#8217; and spur to action the masses; in fact its defeat led to a great crisis in the German Communist Party and increased the isolation of the USSR.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the plenum of the ECCI prior to the Third Congress of the Comintern, he bitterly opposed the introduction of the tactic of the &#8216;United Front&#8217;, the policy designed to win the mass of workers away from their reformist leaders. However he eventually agreed that this tactic should be presented to the Congress as the official policy of the Executive, and delivered the main report to the Congress himself.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA decisive turning point in the international situation was the defeat of the 1923 German revolution. As president of the Comintern, Zinoviev urged on the KPD with left phrases, but only half-heartedly supported Trotsky&#8217;s proposal for a definite plan of action. When the irresoluteness of the KPD leadership led to the failure of the plan, he sanctioned the cancelling of the insurrection at the decisive moment and made the KPD secretary, Brandler, the scapegoat for its failure. When Trotsky protested against this bureaucratic evasion of responsibility, Zinoviev used his influence within the foreign Communist Parties to have Trotsky denounced at the fifth Comintern Congress (the so-called &#8216;Congress of Bolshevization&#8217;)\r\n</p><p>\r\nZinoviev had opposed Trotsky at almost every crucial turn of Bolshevik policy in government; after the onset of Lenin&#8217;s illness in 1922 he had come together with Kamenev and Stalin to form the <em>troika</em> which was eventually to wield virtually all state power. Despite Lenin&#8217;s serious doubts, he led the Petrograd delegation in pushing through Stalin&#8217;s appointment to General Secretary at the 11th Party Congress in 1922.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the 12th Party Congress which took place in the vacuum of leadership left by Lenin&#8217;s illness, the <em>troika</em> covered up their intrigue with a whispering campaign against Trotsky (&#8216;he imagines himself a Bonaparte&#8217;) and a glorification of Lenin.\r\n</p><p>\r\nZinoviev in fact took the initiative in the struggle against Trotsky, answering the crisis of leadership with the suppression of all discussion of policy: &#8216;Every criticism of the party line, even a so-called &#8216;left&#8217; criticism, is now objectively a Menshevik criticism.&#8217;\r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever, when in the summer of 1923 wildcat strikes broke out in the industrial centres, threatening the base of the regime, the triumvirs found many party cadres in sympathy with the strikers&#8217; demands. Within the party, 46 prominent Bolsheviks signed a declaration in October calling for the restoration of party democracy and the right to form factions, and severely criticizing the economic policies of the ruling clique. This was close to the policies fought for by Trotsky.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAdapting to this opposition, Zinoviev made a speech in November promising to restore party democracy&#8212;but once begun, the discussion revealed enormous hostility to the trium-virate within the party, and it was hastily suppressed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTrotsky then openly broke with the &#8216;Old Guard&#8217;, writing an Open Letter attacking their handling of the &#8216;New Course&#8217;.\r\n</p><p>\r\nZinoviev&#8217;s reply, at the 13th Congress the next year, was to demand that Trotsky should publicly recant his views&#8212;an unheard-of demand at that time which many of Zinoviev&#8217;s own supporters would not back, and which he had to drop. &#8216;It is now a thousand times more necessary than ever that the party should be monolithic&#8217;, he declaimed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn autumn 1924 Trotsky wrote &#8216;The Lessons of October&#8217; as a preface to an edition of his speeches in 1917. Zinoviev used this as an excuse to launch the &#8216;Literary debate&#8217;&#8212;a massive campaign in the party press in which the slogan of Trotsky&#8217;s &#8216;under-estimation of the peasantry&#8217; was invented and proclaimed, while the writings of Trotsky and his comrades in the Left Opposition were suppressed. It was implied that Trotsky&#8217;s non-Bolshevik past meant he was hostile to Bolshevism &#8212; i.e. that he was basically a Menshevik at heart.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the end of 1924 Zinoviev demanded in the Politburo that the Central Committee be asked to expel Trotsky from its ranks; Stalin, sensing the crisis this would provoke within the party, refused to comply. Instead Trotsky was dismissed as Commissar of War. Once Trotsky had been removed from any position of power, the chief force holding the triumvirate together was gone. Zinoviev intrigued with Kamenev to oust Stalin from the General Secretaryship, and proposed that he replace Trotsky as Commissar of War; they found it was too late to dislodge Stalin from his position in the apparatus.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe increasing isolation of Russia following the defeat of the German revolution in 1923 and the temporary stabilization of conditions in Western Europe had strengthened the position of the bureaucracy, and during late 1924 brought Stalin to the fore as the dominant force in the <em>troika.</em> When Bukharin abandoned the perspective of revolution in Europe and in autumn 1924 advocated making wholesale concessions to the peasantry so as gradually to build &#8216;socialism in one country&#8217;, Stalin seized on this theory as an ideological justification for the growing power of the apparatus and in April 1925 attempted to make it official party policy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth Zinoviev and Kamenev strongly opposed this move, but the breach was hushed up in order to avoid scandalizing the party. Zinoviev did not come out openly against &#8216;socialism in one country&#8217; until September 1925, in his book <em>Leninism,</em> where he argued that on its own the backward Soviet economy could never raise its productive technique to a level high enough for socialism, and that to abandon the perspective of revolution abroad was a break with Leninist internationalism. At the October session of the Central Committee he demanded a free debate on this question at the forthcoming 14th Party Congress, but was outvoted by the supporters of Stalin and Bukharin, who at the same time prohibited any public criticism of official policy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA tremendous clash between the opposing factions took place at the 14th congress, but the outcome was that Stalin and Bukharin increased their majority on the CC. The new CC immediately set about destroying the strength of the &#8216;Leningrad opposition&#8217;: Zinoviev was replaced by Kirov as Leningrad party secretary and his supporters were removed from positions of authority.\r\n</p><p class=\"skip\">&nbsp;</p><p>\r\nIn April 1926 the Leningrad and Left Oppositions finally began to collaborate; Zinoviev then revealed to Trotsky the methods by which the triumvirate had excluded him from power. At the July session of the CC Zinoviev declared that &#8216;On the question of apparatus-bureaucratic repression, Trotsky was right as against us&#8217;; and Trotsky read out a joint statement attacking Stalin&#8217;s policies.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStalin hit back with a charge that they had violated party discipline by forming a faction, and the CC voted by a massive majority to dismiss Zinoviev as president of the Comintern. The Opposition turned to the party rank-and-file, only to find an organized heckling campaign to prevent them being heard at meetings: Zinoviev was driven from the platform at the 15th conference of the party. However, he shrank back from an all-out conflict with the apparatus, vowing not to bring matters to the point of expulsion from the party&#8212;which meant accepting in advance the limits laid down by Stalin.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIdeologically, Zinoviev remained hostile to the theory of permanent revolution and clung to the shibboleth of the &#8216;democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry&#8217;, even within the Joint Opposition, and insisted that their <em>Platform</em> (1927) should specifically deny its validity.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Platform was drawn up in May as a balance-sheet of the position reached by the revolution, and a campaign for signa-tures to it was launched in preparation for the 15th Congress due at the end of the year. Zinoviev optimistically expected 20-30,000 signatures; they got 6,000. Although their perspectives had been proved correct, the effect of the international defeats of the proletariat was a greater force, producing demoralization throughout the party, and the bureaucracy prepared to expel the opposition before the congress even took place.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn 14th November the CC expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev from the party, together with virtually the entire Opposition. By December Zinoviev had parted company from Trotsky and capitulated to Stalin; on 18th December he appeared at the Congress to condemn his own views as &#8216;wrong and anti-Leninist&#8217;. Zinoviev was readmitted to the party in 1928 and appointed to an unimportant post in the Consumer Co-operatives, then to the Collegium of the Peoples Commissariat of Food. From then on he and Kamenev, who had capitulated with him, issued denunciations of the Left Opposition to the order of the bureaucracy. They had ceased to live politically.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever, during the period 1930-32 when the country was convulsed by the consequences of the forced collectivization begun in 1928, they began anxiously to discuss the dangers of the new policy. The development of the economic crisis led to a revival of opposition to Stalin within the apparatus itself; because of this weakening of its position the bureaucracy had to eliminate any candidates for leadership of any opposition group. For being in possession of a document emanating from the Right Opposition which bitterly attacked Stalin and collectivization, they were expelled from the party and exiled to Siberia. In 1933 they again recanted and prostrated themselves before Stalin; they were finally allowed to return to Moscow in May, broken men.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStalin hoped to use Zinoviev as a means of striking against &#8216;Trotskyism&#8217; and thereby consolidate the ranks of the bureaucracy. In December 1934 Zinoviev and Kamenev were arrested and brought before a military tribunal &#8216;in connection&#8217; with the GPU-engineered assassination of Kirov (this was part of a campaign of harassment to force them to indict Trotsky); they were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment as the leaders of a mythical counter-revolutionary group.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFinally in August 1936 they were brought from the jails to be framed in the first of the Moscow show trials. After making a public &#8216;confession&#8217;, Zinoviev was sentenced to death for &#8216;organizing the joint Trotskyite-Zinovievist Terrorist Centre for the assassination of Soviet government and CPSU leaders&#8217;, and shot on August 21st, 1936.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"inline\">Transcribed by David Walters, 2001</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../archive/zinoviev/index.htm\" target=\"_top\">Gregory Zinoviev Archive</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"footer\">\r\n<a href=\"../../z.htm\">Index of the Letter Z</a> | <a href=\"../../index.htm\">Encyclopedia of Marxism</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
